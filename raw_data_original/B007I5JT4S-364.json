It works well for that. The previous version was more \"open\" and could actually be easily modified to play more content, but Apple blocked that in the latest version so the price is dramatically higher for the previous model in case you are wondering the reason why. In summary, this is working for the purpose I purchased it and I use a different box for the other things.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gamer \"Gamer\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great device. I am not yet taking full advantage of all of the features but it was a snap to set up and is working beautifully.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Julian Rouse"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Model 1469I bought this not really knowing what to expect but once I hooked it up, it basically leads you through the simple setup procedure with onscreen prompts. Once you have it running you have access to a ton of programing and it comes in clearer than my cable signal! Here's the best part, I can stream Amazon Prime movies FREE using the \"Air Play\" feature on my iPad 2 and/or iPhone 4!!I was wondering if \"Air Play\" would work in this way and it does! Once you setup the Apple TV all of your mac devices will show you an \"Air Play\" icon in and obvious area of the application you are using. When you press the icon you will begin seeing what ever was on your device screen on your TV! Works perfect! The sound is great too, in stereo! I watched a movie last night streaming from my iPhone!! I think there is also supposed to be a \"mirror\" feature of Air Play that lets you see the image both on your device and your TV but apparently, it doesn't work on my older devices. So, what you see on your device is a black screen with a message that says \"Your movie is playing on Apple TV.\"One issue to beware of, in my understanding, is that the \"Air Play\" feature is not be available on computers that are older than mid 2011 except for iTunes. So, I have been streaming movies most of the time from my iPad. Not sure why Air Play will not work with older computers unless it is because I have not installed the latest OS X. I am running  OS X 10.8.5 and the AirPlay icon will not show up when I stream an Amazon Prime movie from either of my mid 2010 iMacs. I can however, get AirPlay to work though iTunes and can play anything in my iTunes library through Air Play from my mid 2010 iMacs.Of course you can also rent or even buy movies from iTunes also. It has Netflix and hulu too!When I first setup the apple TV, I had some problems getting it to play a movie without loosing the signal and then waiting for it to re-buffer again to begin playing. I found out that where I had my TV in relation to my wifi was causing it to receive a weak signal. I have my wifi coming from my Apple Time Capsule in the basement office of our home while the TV is up one floor. I checked the signal strength by using my laptop and placing it near the tv and going online and doing an internet speed test. I found that I was only getting about 3 mbps! Once I moved the Apple TV over to the other side of the TV stand and moved it forward about 6 inches the signal jumped up to 25 mbs! That solved the problem and we have since been watching movies every night!I have since installed an Apple Airport Express which can be used to boost your wifi signal from one area of your home to the next. It was super easy to setup and it simply joined my network on the Time Capsule when I plugged it in and asked me if I wanted to use it to expand my wifi network. Now I have a much stronger signal in the upper area of our home!If you have all Apple products like we do with 3 computers an iPad and Two iPhones, this is a must have! Just get it and enjoy!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Megrier \"G. Meir\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's the best thing ever!
