I figure that there are many other people like me out there that want to know how this measures up.It's cheaper. It has a dual band (which the stick model of roku doesn't have) which is supposed to allow for better wifi reception. I can't say it's better than the single banded stick, because my roku stick is in the bedroom next to the modem. What I CAN say is that from the living room, my dual banded Roku 2 gets WAY better wifi reception than the Fire TV Stick. I actually bought the Fire TV stick for my aunt, who is in a nursing home. Dual banded or not, the Fire TV stick will not keep a wifi signal long enough to even get a movie loaded, even though the Wifi server is only about 150 feet down the hall, at most. I'll be giving this to one of my kids for Christmas. It's useless for what I bought it for.Both Roku and Fire TV allow pretty much \"plug and play\" capability with any TV that has an HDMI port. Both have remote controls, and both have remote control apps that you can download to your phone for even easier use.Fire TV has a very limited number of apps, or \"channels\" to select from. Most of the favorites are there (Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, etc) but it is definitely missing some that I can't live without... such as Vudu or any other movie network that you can stream your digital and ultraviolet copies from. Understandably so, I guess, since Amazon is naturally going to be proprietary. But Amazon doesn't allow you to link up to a UV library of films that you own, and until they do, Amazon's movie streaming is going to always be less desirable in my opinion. And that means that their Fire TV stick is going to be a distant second to Roku. Same goes for cloud based playlists. Amazon's Fire TV Stick will let you run Pandora, but you're screwed if you want to listen to a Spotify playlist that you pay a monthly fee to have access to.The Fire TV stick also loads the channels much slower than Roku.So there ya have it. Make your own choice. My choice will continue to be Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "christie smith"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "great speed. really enjoy although buffering on some things aggravating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steve Shropshier"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got the firestick \"free\" with a three month subscription to Sling TV.  While I think the Sling service works well, I was really impressed with the Firestick and think it's more than worth the $40 purchase price.  Menus are fast and it is easy to navigate.  If you have Netflix and/or Amazon Prime it's all the entertainment you will ever need.  Free apps like the PBS Kids App are awesome if you have little kids.  Fast and easy to set up.
