Wish the voice recognition worked with non-Amazon apps (Netflix for ex) but SO far above the other competing products that it still deserves 5 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brandon I"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really like this little thing.  It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, the remote too.  It's very easy to use, very responsive and has an awesome array of options.  I like it because I can watch youtube on my TV.  One thing; you really, really, really, really, really need Amazon Prime with this.  They just work so well together.  I'm not much of a gamer so I can't really comment there.  Everything else, though, is top notch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Uly Pittman"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "My Amazon Fire keeps freezing up, it is very frustrating", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lisa B.

It works fine wired.  Support for this product online is a joke.All I can get When I try to connect is a message that it avoided a poor internet signal.
