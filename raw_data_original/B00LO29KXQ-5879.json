A lot faster. But the Roku has a little nicer interface. Amazon is also nice because of the games. That's a plus. But in the 2weeks that I've had the Amazon, it has froze/lagged on me more times than I like. For that reason, the Amazon gets a 4star rating.Overall: U can't go wrong choosing the Roku stick OR the Amazon stick. But I prefer the price of the Amazon ($39).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Duangdee Phommalee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick seems to work quite well with our 42 inch Sony 3D TV.  We are pleased that we can pause the videos and fast forward and reverse.  I could not get the stick itself to insert into the HDMI slot, but it will insert via the HDMI extender that came in the box.  In another room, 10 feet away, we have a Samsung 24 inch TV/computer monitor in which we tried the Fire TV Stick, but a message appears that our internet connection is too slow and it has to buffer too much.  However it is the same Wi-Fi as with the Sony.  It must be that the Samsung doesn't have enough memory to allow streaming of videos.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bob Oaks"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it.quick and easy setup, better than expected", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ADI PERRY"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works well - happy to have it as part of my entertainment arsenal.
