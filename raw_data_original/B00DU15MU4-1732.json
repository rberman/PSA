No connection over wifi even though it can see my wifi network clearly. 2 boxes, same thing. My internet radio, laptop, tablet and phone are all fine. I was hoping to enjoy this as I flick between 2 wifi routers, one a UK one and one a US one.

The interface is very easy to use which is super nice.  The system is fast!  There is no lag time between scrolling or playing the video content.  My only complaint is that there is no off switch and the remote controller is not as nice as the apple tv controller, but that is just me being picky.  I am also hoping for more content as time passes.  The moment Amazon gets more content than there absolutely no reason to buy any other streaming box because this one will get the job done and some.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "JRock457"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Nathan Slone"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "An excellent companion to my TiVo premier. I love the speed and interface of the fire tv. the optional addons are a lovely open ended upgradablity that I intend to take advantage of. I can watch live or recorded TV shows, as well as youtube; Amazon Prime Video; Netflix and Pandora on my old Tivo bo, but the  Fire TV gives me a much faster and more robust interface for streaming content.

I already own a Fire TV Stick which I'm very happy with for use in my bedroom, but I wanted another device for my home theater, and I'm NOT disappointed. The device is well built and preforms flawlessly.The Fire TV definitely outperforms its little brother (the Stick). In my experience, the Stick can be sluggish at times when responding to remote commands and browsing the interface. On the contrary, the Fire TV is always very responsive. This may be because the Fire TV is connected via wired Ethernet and the Stick is using WiFi (only option).As for picture quality; I'd say they're the same. I don't think the casual user would notice any difference, unless your home WiFi network is under-preforming or over loaded.  Although, performance may very based on your available internet bandwidth. I have an 11Mbps DSL service, with very heavy network traffic (5 users with xbox one, PS4, Wii U, laptops, tablets, smartphones, VOIP phone, etc...) and the picture quality is always great on both device. I have yet to experience any hesitation on either device while streaming.I'd recommend the Fire TV to anyone who demands a high performance streaming device. It provides the additional features of optical audio out for high quality sound when connected to  a home theater entertainment system; and wired Ethernet for higher performance LAN connectivity. If these features are not important to you, save some money and get a Fire TV Stick.All-in-all, I'm happy with my purchase, but I will say that at a retail price of $99 they should include an HDMI cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "R.

I called a customer rep and she said, Amazon tech team would give me a call and work on it. Till date i did not receive any call. Last week i got an email from them asking whether the issue got resolved? I tried responding them thru email and the email was bounced back to me.
