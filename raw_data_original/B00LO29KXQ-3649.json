Apparently they were out of stock but no mention of that was made at the time of purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "havanese mom"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Bought this to replace our Roku which had died after a couple years of use. We were using our Wii in between waiting for the Fire stick to arrive.  First of all they don't give you any instructions other than plug it in and it is supposed to automatically connect to the remote if not change the batteries. Duh! It did not say how to put the batteries in the remote so I had to Google it. I suppose if you buy electronic items more often that I do you would have figured it out without Googling it. When I added the Netflix app it come up with all the original selections without my preferences without my My List nor my Recently Watched, it stayed like this for a couple hours which was annoying but eventually it corrected itself.I get the concept of adding Apps to my selection and I use the Apps to access different things just like your phone or Ipad so that was easy. I would have liked more  clarification/separation among the apps I would have to pay for content and those which I could access content for free. It keeps buffering several times during movies which is annoying(My Roku never had that problem) I like the way the menu displays it seems easier to see the selections and the preview window. It works for me and my kids love watching their Youtube videos on the TV now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Talliana"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent!

There are lots of movies and shows to choose from as well as different apps. My biggest complaint is the network connection. My fire stick is just above my wireless router and losses connection at least once a day. I have to unplug and plug back in and then it works fine again for a while. Also the fire stick needs to be plugged into a power source at all times to work, it would be nice if it just used a rechargeable battery. For the price it's a good device, but it still needs some improvements.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Just another Mom"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Worked first day.  Does nothing but drop connection now.  Wifi is strong as I can see the signal strength on my phone app.  Tried power cycling everything.  Doesn't help.  Read other posts and it appears that this is a very common problem.
