Picked up this fire stick on Prime Day and plugged it in as soon as it came in. Super fast and easy set up. Not as fast as a chromecast, but fast enough. The menu is really clean and easy to navigate. The power cord is plenty long. The remote and app both work with ease. Over all I really like it, enough to say I can throw out the Roku now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jessie Hernandez"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Froze once and stopped working.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kevin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works great.
