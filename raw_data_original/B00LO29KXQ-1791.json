[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "We got this so we could have access to Sling TV.  With our cable bill up over $170 it was time to cut the 'cable'.Sling TV gives us live news (CNN) and a few other channels we enjoy.  The service is ok for $20.The problem is the Fire Stick.  It drops connection, its constantly buffering.  Its a really annoying.  We didn't pay for the Stick.  We bought Sling TV for 3 months and got the stick for free......And I have to say, even for free, its annoying.What we found out later, Our Roku box has Sling TV as an app.  No buffering, no dropping.  Works great.I know the Fire Stick is suppose to have some benefits over the Roku and other such devices.  We don't need storage, and whatever the other benefits are, we haven't needed them.We are putting the Fire Stick on the spare TV and moving the Roku into the living room.Hopefully they can work out whatever bugs are in the stick that cause it to drop and buffer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Tracey A."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I always love Amazon products. We own several Kindles and the Echo. This Fire Stick is below the standard. We have hope that Anazon will improve the product and await the next release.Problems: really it's just that it's unbelievably slow.

Love the integration with Amazon Prime, as well as access to pretty much all the other streaming services.  I also have the full size Amazon Fire TV, so the Fire TV Stick isn't quite as smooth or responsive as its bigger brother.  That's probably to be expected due to its size.  It still works great regardless... just not as refined.  I would buy it again without hesitation.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William E Kraft"}]
