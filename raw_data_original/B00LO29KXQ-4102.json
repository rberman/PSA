Thanks Amazon for the great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rafael Santamarina"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This was well packed and in packaging of high quality and app parts are seemingly of high quality. One design feature that is pretty stupid, however, is that the power cable hangs off the bottom edge of the fire stick, weighing it down so that it stresses the HDMI port. It is not loose or anything, but it just bothers me to have connectors under any sort of real, physical stress. Of course, had the cord come from the end it would have created *more* stress and would have made routing the power cord a PITA.It is not able to be played via USB - you MUST use an HDMI port on your television. Mine has four, so home theater, AppleTV and the Fire Stick - I still have one left. The interface is *not* AppleTV. It is its own thing and is easy to understand and (so far) to navigate. I have not yet discovered how to access Netflix. I have only used Amazon's own video library. (If I have an issue with using this I will update this review to reflect that.)The interface has built-in sounds for clicks and such, like AppleTV. I am a diehard Mac person (since 1987) and will nearly always use an Apple product if given a choice. To me this interface feels snappier and has sounds that are more subtle but give the experience a false sense of precision. I cannot really describe it, but the stupid sounds seem to actually improve the user experience.The remote is decent. It has more button than it needs, much like my Google Nexus 7 has more \"button\" icons for navigation than that excellent UI really needs. Apple has the edge on minimalism that works well. This menu and the remote buttons have a slight clunkiness to them. I like the extra buttons and they seem to work well, but I have become used to my Apple aluminum remote that is so beautifully simple. I see a massive remote with 40 buttons and I see some guy swilling beer in his recliner yelling at his wife to get him a \"sammich\" while he watches ESPN. The Fire Stick remote and aspects of the interface fall somewhere between this guy and the supremely simple Apple stuff. I like it, though, so despite having what I consider to be superfluous mechanical buttons (each being a part that could fail at some time in the near future) I rank it very close to AppleTV. It is as good, perhaps better in some ways, and is sleek despite the step backward in design.Setup was easy and fast. I really dislike the face that such a small device has a full-sized plug. In fact, the plug is absolutely crappy. It seems to be well made, but it is huge and will take up two or three spaces on your power strip, depending on how tightly yours is spaced. No excuse. Four stars specifically for this STUPIDLY DESIGNED plug. I have to see if there is any electrical difference between the same plug that the iPhone uses. It is very slick and fits neatly into a single space. It is USB and the Fire Stick's cord also is USB. I have to look into this as I have no more spaces on my strip because this unit took up two on mine - the one at the bottom where it lives as well as the one above it: there is no way to use that plug because the HUGE, square plug base covers up a LOT of the adjacent socket. Hey, Amazon! The nitwit who believed that a SQUARE plug fitting over a RECTANGULAR socket space needs to be fired, and the nitwit who APPROVED this idea needs to be beaten and locked in a room filled with Betamax tapes and VHS machines! Seriously?The user experience of this is pretty good. I would say it easily rivals (though does not really quite best) AppleTV at about half the price. If you have prime video and one of these you have a very cost-conscious way to have something very much like AppleTV and Netflix. No iTunes, though. Too bad that Amazon and Apple cannot play nice-nice and work out a deal so that Amazon can stream via AppleTV or even view Amazon content on my television at all. This is a bit of a \"kludge\" to remedy this, but it is a *very* high quality kludge that I will use often.Four stars only because of the idiotic size and shape of the USB plug unit. It would have been five, Amazon. Please fix this absolutely stupid plug and you will have a great piece of tech here!I recommend this highly, especially if you have Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pachyderm"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A+", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Justin Kallenbach"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Simple setup.

However the Fire TV Stick doesn't currently support the ability to use shared-private networks that require a username& password to log in so I cannot connect to my school's secure network. Normally this would be no problem since we have a public network as well, but because I don't have the option to open an internet browser  either, I can't even register this device for the public network either, leaving me with a TV, a Fire Stick, and no ability to watch anything on them. My school's IT department said that Amazon is currently working on an update to fix this issue, so I hope it happens soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brianne"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excedded my  expectations very easy to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul Henderson"}]
