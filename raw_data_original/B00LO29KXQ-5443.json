[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!  I picked it up on the two day special for Prime members for $20.  I've been waiting to pick up something for streaming without paying a lot for it.  Cannot beat $20.  Like a few others I was slightly disappointed that the stick needs power, especially seeing I am planing on using this in my RV sometimes too.  But not a deal breaker, especially for what I paid.  I added a digital optical audio cable to connect the audio through my Bose (picked up that idea from searching YouTube how to videos) because I need more out of my audio than TV speakers.  The remote is a huge plus, especially for this price, even at the regular $40 it's well worth it and I recommend it.  Games and other apps are nice too.  Hoping to get Show Box on there somehow too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

Thought I would be easily able to move this from one TV to the next but it must be plugged in at each TV.  Need to make it clear in the general description and pictures that this needs a power cord and is not powered by the TV!  Why have all the pictures without a cord unless you're trying to mislead people into thinking it's actually portable?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Beth"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Unable to switch back to FIOS after using the fire stick. I have to turn off the entire system and turn back on after using the fire stick. Searching for movies is a little difficult. When I have found something to watch, it's been great.

Some apps, namely Hulu do not function well on it. The streaming pauses frequently. I have Roku devices on wifi in the house that don't have any issues with Hulu. I tried the Fire Stick from multiple locations and had issues from every one. Upon searching, it seems others had issues as well. The voice search worked well on it, but I ended up returning it and purchasing another Roku. Can't deal with the constant streaming issues with the Fire Stick. I'm sure it will get better as they update the device, but it's just not ready for prime time right now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "M.
