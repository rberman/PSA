[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "So great, I bought four Fire TV boxes (two for me and one for a daughter).  We have one in our RV and one at home.  It is the perfect RV companion because we don't have to worry about the local channel line up or our finicky BluRay player on the road.

Wish it had more apps like the Apple TV. The only issue is I don't think it has good child safety features on it.
