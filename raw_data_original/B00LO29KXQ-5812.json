I wanted it for an upstairs bedroom for when I wanted to watch netflix or prime upstairs. I like the trivia comes, like you don't know jack. The remote is sensitive and occasionally lags. Startup is fast and simple. I love that I have spotify but I think it's stupid that I still have to play it on my phone instead of logging into my account and syncing my account to the stick. But since I don't have a speaker doc for my phone, it works. For the price this works great for what I want. I can't say that it's probably much better than a roku 3 stick or anything, so it falls in line with all of those others.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I liked Google cromecast better then this..., I like casting to my tv.
