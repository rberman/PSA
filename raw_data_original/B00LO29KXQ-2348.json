[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "We were excited when we received this device and I installed in my living room TV. The first couple of days it work beautifully but them when ever I tried playing any movie either from Netflix or Prime list I am getting an error i think is HDVC error pertaining to content. I have searched and searched for a solution and can not figure it out. Some said to shut off TV and reboot. Others have said to reboot the stick which I have done this thousands of times but to no avail. I now have the Chromecast and it has been working fine. Amazon needs to fix this before offering this stick for $38.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jose Laguardia"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I rarely do reviews but I have to say I love this device. It is portable, it is small, it is intuitive, just great. I actually use it on a very old Hitachi Ultravision, circa 2005, through a HDMI-DVI converter (about 35$). I intend to travel with it and believe it will work on most hotel TV's. Still yet to try.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Will P"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best ever never no errors", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "natalie scott"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "No reduced data usage settings for those on data limited ISPs like satellite providers or wireless hotspots.
