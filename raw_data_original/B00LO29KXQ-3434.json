[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I just got the Stick the other day to replace another device we were using for streaming and I would have to say I am pretty impressed. Setup was simple and it's connection to my network is better than my other device. Picture quality looked good streaming Netflix. The interface to navigate through the different menus works pretty well. The remote isn't exactly the most robust remote out there but you can use your phone as a remote which I have not tested yet. One of my gripes is the only way to turn it totally off is to unplug it otherwise it simply goes to sleep mode but it's not a deal breaker.Update - After having had it for enough time to get a good amount of streaming in I am downgrading one star. I have run in to regular issues with delays in the response of button pushes on the remote or no response at all. Unplugging the Stick then powering it back up seems to solve the issue at least temporarily. When it is streaming it works great but being unable to navigate properly is a huge drawback. Hopefully this can be fixed in a firmware update and I would upgrade my rating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "drumenigma"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Good !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/6", "author": "mtorma"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use and enjoy the selection.
