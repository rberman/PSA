The device and remote are high quality and the picture and sound are far superior to my satellite provider. We,'ve been renting the majority of our films on Fire. My only critique is that not all apps translate from my Amazon account to the Fire TV. Please correct this if possible.  Also the controllers are on back order. I'll be waiting about 4 months until mine arrives.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BigJoe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it I couldn't be happier 5 stars all day long.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE!
