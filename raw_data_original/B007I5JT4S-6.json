It's a part of the ecosystem, as you can project the screen of any Apple device that has AirPlay.

This comes with power cord only. Truly a plug and play device. One of the simplest, trouble free electronic devices I've ever utilized. Plug in power. Plug in ethernet or connect wireless. Run HDMI to TV or reciever. That's it. The device will power itself up and walk you through a quick set up screen. It will be easier if you have created an iTunes account already. Updates will download w/in the first several minutes hooking it up.I won't go into a lot of detail about the icons/apps as they are well explained here and other places. The UI is user friendly and easy to navigate using the small, sleek remote control. The only one I've really played with so far is Netflix which connected to my account using just user name and pw. Didn't have to run up to the home computer and register the device to my NF account. Very easy. Unless you subscribe to iTunes Match ($25/yr.) you must ha...

The remote control, however, is abysmal.  Its buttons are slightly recessed and cramped, making it uncomfortable to use and easy to hit the wrong one.  The worst offender is the thin ring used to move the screen cursor.  It is almost impossible to use without inadvertently hitting the enter button, thereby creating problems.  It's especially frustrating when having to move through a series of selections, such as when needing to type out a name.  For a company known for its design, Apple seems have forgotten that the remote was meant for human use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
