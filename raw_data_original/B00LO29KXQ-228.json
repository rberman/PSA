[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I bought this to stream Netflix but after I installed it I read the reviews rating the Fire Stick and Netflix, which were horrible. Instead I use it to watch Amazon Prime, which I love.  One other problem with the Fire Stick was it arriving with German as it's default language.  Customer service at Amazon walked me through re-setting it and then I was able to change to English.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JoanneB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this on a whim mostly because I wanted to be able to stream videos through Amazon without using my xbox live.
