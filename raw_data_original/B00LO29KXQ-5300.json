(If this worked it would be a 5+ star product.Overall, for $29 (Prime special pricing) It's great for all of my entertainment needs at home.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Wyhteagle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "One of the best Fire Sticks Ever!Gave me 1 year of prime, FREE!! :D", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tremendo Sell-Out Equipment"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I started out with some difficulty but found that the problem was not with the Fire Stick but with my WIFI signal strength. since my cable provider corrected that problem, performance has been excellent.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "George"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.

We travel a lot, and rather than all of us huddled around our kindles, it makes sense to buy one of these, but only if I can connect by opening a browser to sign in to the internet.

The software does need a bit of work. There needs to be a way to set the sleep timer. Additionally the sleep button needs to be more easily accessible from the main menu. It's currently buried 4 screens down in the settings menu. The interface is very busy, but still easy to navigate... for the Amazon stuff only. Any of the other vendor stuff (YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc.) is buried and bit problematic to find.
