[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I like the ease of use and that I can get to both my Prime and Netflix accounts. My complaint is that it doesn't hold a charge so unless you buy ANOTHER accessory, you have a cord visible down your wall. Most of us these days have tvs mounted on the wall and plan so that no cords show so we certainly don't want a cord to show for this either.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
