He likes Apple TV well enough, but finds it somewhat limiting with what can be rented vs. purchased (it would be nice to rent movies and not necessarily buy them). Perhaps it's a licensing thing, we don't know, but it's still a kink in the system.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "E.

I never thought it could be more difficult to get out of bed, what with the crippling paranoia that accompanies the dangers of our modern world, but I can say definitively that now I only have two reasons to get out of bed, neither of which require me to leave the safety of my home.

Roku is more user friendly and a much better value while offering more features in today's market.I am using my Roku while the Apple TV sits idle.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "George Wietor"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "My son bought me this for Xmas. The first thing struck me was 'Apple asks people to buy this to buy their stuff?' It is like having to pay for the shopping cart to shop at Walmart! How clever! Some people, for example the ones camp out on the street to buy new Apple stuff, may be so ensnared by the name Apple to do that. But as far as this product is concerned the king is naked. Also, the 'airplay' is poor at best and I have a robust WiFi, which I juggled in many different ways to deal with spotty performance to no avail. For this money one should simply buy a DVD with a built-in WiFi and access Netflx, Hulu, etc. I should know some about this stuff; I am in IT business, 25 yrs in all.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "5/13", "author": "Good Natured"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far, works ok.
