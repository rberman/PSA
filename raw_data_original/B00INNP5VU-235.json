It came registered to someone else and I verified this with Roku.  Easily correctable by a factory reset, but why would I want to pay full price for NEW when I could save $10 on USED?  I didn't - so this is being returned.UPDATE  3.28.15 - I contacted the Amazon customer that originally had this device (their info was on the Roku setup screen).  Turns out they returned it because it was defective and didn't work.  No wonder I couldn't get it to work either.  It's amazing that Amazon tried to pawn it off as new and working when it wasn't either.  Be careful folks - I factory reset it so no one's info was on it, but anyone (including Amazon) can do that and it will \"appear\" to be a new stick.I was also unable to get anything but 2.0 stereo sound from the stick on my 7.1 surround sound.  The Roku support folks were of no assistance and the language barrier certainly didn't help.  I initially had it running through my receiver (HTS C6930 by Samsung) - as all my other electronics do - nothing but stereo.  Roku suggested I try plugging into my TV directly (another Samsung product) and then running sound to the HTS.  Same results - nothing but stereo sound.The picture quality also kept changing from 1080p to 720p and back again.  I have a 1080p capable TV and very strong connection - consistently 22+mbps or more.So, all in all, with the used product being sent when ordered new and the audio/video issues that couldn't be resolved with Roku support, I am less than impressed with this product.  I ordered it only so I could stream Netflix movies, but I am fine with continuing to receive DVDs in the mail.  That old adage \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" certainly applies to me in this situation.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Luv My Pups"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Quit working after three months", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William Sholes"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to set up, and a lot of channel selection.

Several channels also load with commercials you can't skip. The remote is slow, clunky to use and includes such unhelpful options such as a \"Blockbuster\" shortcut button. You cannot set it up without a credit card on file with Roku. The interface is fine, but a bit slow. At $49 it's just barely worth it if you want the services without a smart TV. Barely.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Samcin"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I wondered about the ability of this stick to stream, given that it would be installed directly behind the mass of my small flat screen in my shop.  That location is the closest physically to my router a floor above and a room over.  I have four Roku boxes --- not sticks --- in the house, and all stream fine.  This, I hoped would be a lower cost alternative.  Alas, it was not to be.It took a while for the stick to pair with the remote, but after that the remote did control the stick as it should.  However, I could find no color video content Roku offered that could stream without buffering every few seconds.  Black and white stuff was OK; audio only was OK.  There were some other associated problems with loading channels that had many menu items or selections.My shop TV, like several others, is mounted in a custom enclosure, and the additional shielding that comes from that no doubt contributed to the problems I encountered.  I'm going to try the stick in one of the guest bedrooms and see if a TV just sitting on a dresser, not in an enclsure, gets better results.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard D.

The quick buttons for Netflix and Amazon make jumping from one flick to the next fast. Don't have to fuss through my Xbox...takes forever! I also control the media from the app on my phone when I need my boys to stop what they're doing and come in. Cool.
