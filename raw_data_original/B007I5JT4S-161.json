It does not \"just work\" Quite the opposite in fact. If it even when it is working properly, it lacks obvious features that would make the experience worthwhile. You have to Log in separately to every app on the device, over and over again. Which is a pain with the tiny absurdly expensive, easily lost remote.  If you have the remote app on your phone, you get to use a keyboard (sometimes) if the app will connect to your tv. Even if you get the Remote app working I guarantee that it will not work for more than a week, before you have log out of home sharing on every device you own restart them all, log back in, and pray for another week of usefulness.  I am leaving out a half dozen other frustrating annoyances.  If they ever come out with an update, Wait a year or so for the jury to come out on it, before you waste your money.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott M.

I haven't tried its competitors, but the AppleTV interface, like all other Apple interfaces, is so intuitive and easy to control.  I'm a seasoned iTunes user, so linking up my library to the AppleTV was a breeze.  I use Netflix, YouTube and my library - there are a bunch of other apps (HBO GO, ABC GO, NBATV, etc) that I never really use; I think you need subscriptions to most of these, but for what I have the Apple TV do for me, it's enough.  I even bring it to vacations with me and plug it into the hotel TV (and Ethernet), which lets the kiddos watch their favorite shows on Netflix.

In addition, I had some initial issues that turned out to be Comcast cable related. The customer support reps at Apple were able to give me better advice re my cable service then the reps at Comcast... go figure!!! When you purchase this, you will need two additional things: (1) a HDMI high speed cable. (2) high speed internet with your service provider.... otherwise, it will take forever for your purchases to download. If dealing with Comcast, you must make sure that they are leasing you the latest high speed router (if you do not own the one you are using) along with the high speed internet service you are paying for. Sounds simple, but this has been a huge problem for Comcast customers who are paying for one thing and receiving another.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sean W."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "sometimes not stable compared with google's product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G luke"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Nice...
