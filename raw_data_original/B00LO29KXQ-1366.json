[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "between my Prime account and my Netflix account the firestick does a great job of having a single point of control.  I can stop using my Wii for TV.I can also easily move the firestick from one TV to another. This is especially helpful when I'm in my camper and TV reception is poor. I just fire up my wireless access point and plug in the firestick.  Game on!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephen Chott"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE.

In order to view the Netflix movies that I want, I have to pay over $20 a month.  And even then I can't get the more recent movies.  If I go back to having my Netflix CD's mailed, it will cost me less and I can watch the movies I want.  My dissatisfaction has made me hesitate to view the other programs on the fire stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "Tina"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a very useful device.

I wanted it because I didn't want to spend the extra money to have the wifi built into my TV ... this saved me probably $70-100 over the price of a similarly sized TV with Smart capabilities.  If you have a PS4 or a Wii U or whatever ... you'll wonder why you got this (I know I did).  But it rocks for a TV in a room that has no cables run and where I had no inclination to run any cables.  Throw the TV on a mount and you have exactly one cable to hide (the power cable for the TV... because this can get it's power from MOST - not all I found out on my other TV - USB ports)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Karl R Harmdierks"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!
