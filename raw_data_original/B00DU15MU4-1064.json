There aren't enough choices on Prime that are worth while to watch, actually I feel it is mostly \"junk\" that at least my family doesn't want to watch. From there you have to either rent or buy movies and this is not why I bought the Fire TV. I ordered the game controller at the same time I bought my Fire TV, and now I have been told I might not even get that until April or May...very disappointed!!! I see right now it is not available, they should have had it listed that way in December when I ordered it! Again, disappointed. I go back and forth on whether I even want to keep this, but I think I just went past the time to return it. Amazon might not have control of the Apps available, but I find the YouTube app extremely difficult to use and to find things on YouTube to watch, and this was important to me. The only things positive about the Fire TV is the ease to hook up and the voice search works very well...although when you search it WILL list what you were searching for but then no results will come up. Such as..you search for a particular movie, it will list it..so you think they have it. But when you select it, it's not really there so a list of other movies will come up. I have been frustrated since the beginning and had I known all this I would have never wasted my money on the Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Twinrocks"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely the best device ever made for an enhanced Kindle experience.

We had a few weeks to try it out before our Prime came up for renewal (with the price increase!) and we love it! We decided to keep the Prime so we could binge-watch all the \"no extra cost\" series that are available. Although the rentals are pretty inexpensive, there is so much to watch that is included in the Prime Membership, we may never find a reason to justify it.The set up was easy, the picture is crisp & clear on our HD screen, and the remote is simple.
