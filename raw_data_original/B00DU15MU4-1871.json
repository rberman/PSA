I keeps me from losing my cool when I have to wait, for what seems like everything, these days.  It also seems to be one of the few 'new fangled' things older people embrace quickly.

I have an apple TV, roku 3, roku stick and wdtv live and thought I'd try this.The good.1. It is well made2. It is nicely designed3. It fires up quickly4. It processes video well5. The remote is nice to hold and use6. The games controller is nicely made and works well7. The massive heat sink lets it run fairly cool8. The setup is brilliantly easy9. It runs prime and netflix really well10. It is very well pricedThe bad.1. Spotify is rubbish on it as it is Spotify connect which means you actually have to stream to it from say your phone which is crap.2. The voice search is misleading as it only works in amazons app, so you can't use it for youtube, plex, spotify or anything else which makes it pretty limited if you have a watch list as you don't really need to search it.3. The interface is a bit clunky compared to Roku which is really really good. It feels like it needs a version 2 to work out the bugs and a bit of a rethink about how people actually navigate. The interface seems like it is heavily biased to using the amazon store and prime, which lets it down in all other areas. Basically they should copy the roku interface.4. Video fast forwarding in Plex is hit and miss, sometimes when you try fast forwarding it just doesn't do anything and you have to restart the video before you can get it to fast forward. The same video on the Roku 3 on the same network plays faultlessly.5. Like the Roku it wont play files off your network unless you run Plex. This is ok but can be painful if several people are using Plex in the house. The wdtv live is the hands down winner for this. But in time with faster NAS units being able to run Plex it will become a redundant point.6. If you live outside the US it is super painful to work out how to rent movies as you need a US issued credit card.7. It can't do cross content searching like the roku 38. It is very limited in its channels and most obviously missing is Vudu which would be a competitor to Amazon. At least Vudu lets people outside the US rent movies.9. The whole box seems a little to geared towards amazon selling you content so they limit the apps and channels that could be any competition. This is the main reason I hate my apple TV and the reason I love the Roku 3 as Roku have nothing to sell you but their hardware.If it ran spotify, improved its interface, used voice search for other apps it would be a hands down winner. However it doesn't so the Roku 3 is getting plugged back in and someone is getting this re gifted to them for Christmas.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "6/6", "author": "Manorsessions \"Ciao\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We were so impressed when we got our first Fire TV that we bought a second one for our other TV. We have disconnected satellite/cable and just use Fire TV to stream Prime content, Netflix and Hulu. The Fire TV is intuitive, the remote is easy to use, and our picture is always clear.
