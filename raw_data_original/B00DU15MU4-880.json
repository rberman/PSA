[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "This item met my expectations overall as far as electronic quality.  Where it failed to meet expectations is that I sensed that by purchasing this item and Amazon Prime I would find a very good value.  Unfortunately Prime failed in that there are many shows that I have to pay for which I thought were included.  I have also read many reviews regarding utilizing the app Netflix with Amazon Fire TV.  The reviews have not been good at all.  Come on Amazon you have met my expectations regarding products and shipping I hope you fix this problem or offer a work around.Maybe your firmware upgrades will fix this issue with the app netflix so that i can subscribe and get the movies and tv shows that matter to me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "S.
