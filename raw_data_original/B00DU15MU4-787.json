I have the WDTV live and I had Apple TV which I return.  Comparing the three devices I prefer the FireTV due to the apps and the speed of the product. The  Apple TV does not allow you to install any apps!! I quickly returned the Apple TV due to this reason. Yes you can use air play, but when viewing a video, the video does not fill the screen and you have to have two devices turned on. I already had the WDTV which I used for three years, but the speed and lack of apps available was showing its age on this four year old device. I do not have cable TV or satalite and Sling TV came out last month and only two devices supported this app and they are FireTV and Roku3. I also use PlexTV since the FireTV does not play direct DLNA which is why I used the WDTV. The only issue I have is the lack of accessories such as the USB Tuner. The WDTV has support for a USB Tuner. I used it to watch over the air HDTV. Hopefully FireTv will support a USB tuner in the future.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Miguel Orama"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best and easiest download/stream technology I have ever used.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Harveyman"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "The sound doesn't work :/", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aldossari Ali"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Only three stars for several reasons, but mostly because of the Amazone promotion partnering a deal with the Fire TV and Sling TV. The only thing I need cable TV for is ESPN. Since Sling offers live ESPN, I figured I could disconnect Cable TV service by taking this Fire TV - Sling TV deal.  But the fast-moving action of a basketball does not look good through the Sling TV app on the Fire TV, it is not nearly as fluid and smooth as on Cable. I still have my cable and was switching back and forth to compare. My internet service is over 50 mbps and my Fire TV is connected with Ethernet cabling, so data speed is not the issue. Now, thanks to the Amazon promotion, I'm stuck having pre-paid for three months of Sling TV that I'm not satisfied with. Sling - ESPN Live looks fine on a tablet or phone, but not on a real TV.I'm also not crazy about the User interface compared to my Apple TV I was ready to give up for the Fire TV - Sling TV solution.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "R.
