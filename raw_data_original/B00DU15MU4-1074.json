That is pretty dumb designing, if you ask me. The design is okay, otherwise, so I have no complaints. I have learned of the many other complaints that other people have had, and I can't help, because I haven't experienced those.

It doesn't. Roku3 presents a virtual remote control of the being used at the host Slingbox. FireTv prevents a disjointed, poorly conceived & thoughtout, array of various icons.  Sure hopes it get better.

It works pretty good except for during playback the screen will go to static and say that the device cannot play the file right now. This happens on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime so I know it's not the stream from the provider. I also have a fire tv stick that plays just fine.It gets annoying having to pick up the remote every 15-20 min to click play again during a movie.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!! Great with Amazon Prime!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pattie Alliston"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "From my initial impressions, it is locked down to essentially use just amazon services.  From my reading online, if you try to reprogram it (root it), amazon has a built in fuse that will essentially cause it self destruct if amazon figures out that you have hacked it.  That is ridiculous for a product that I paid real money for.  I could understand if amazon still owned it and was letting me use it for free, but I paid for it and therefore it is mine to use as I wish.  I wish I could return this device as I don't see myself using it, but I received it as a gift and don't have the receipt.I received a $100 paperweight for Christmass", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/6", "author": "Rick"}]
