I was looking for something a little more simple as far as my husband using it.  He said there were too many steps to go through to search for what he wants to watch.  Plus there were no live shows, you have to wait a day or two to see the shows you want to watch.  Also we couldn't get the local channels through the Fire TV.  I tried Netflix, that was good for movie watching, and so was Prime, but don't think Prime was worth the money. I tried Sling, but still no local channels available.  So I returned the box, maybe in a year or two things will get better with these apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "B. Cornett \"bc\""}]
