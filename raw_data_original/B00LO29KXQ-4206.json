I called technical support and they also could not figure it out and told me that not every phone works and I should contact Samsung to check. That's bizarre. I have Galaxy S5 with android 5.0 and it works perfectly fine with Roku and Chromecast. I think its false advertisement. I would not recommend this product to anyone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "viv"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this Fire TV Stick.
