[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far I am not in love with the Fire tv. I wanted to love it but I just like it. It has all the apps of our roku but doesn't seem to be as user friendly. I am also disappointed with the selection of free prime shows amazon offers (I realize that is not a feature of the device but is worth stating) The voice feature is neat but certainly not enough to make me buy this over a roku. It was easy to set up, it works fine, and it is sleek looking- but there is just nothing super ground breaking about it or that sets it apart from its competitors.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "JHolland"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Received this as a gift. Wanted to like it...but lame search functions and I miss all of my Apple apps and iTunes functionality. Sent it back and got Apple TV instead.

What about the content I already have, or paid for a download to my computer? My decades old music library? Do I need to buy all these things again, but now from Amazon? As others have noted, search is a major pain - and what is this \"predictive buffering\" all about. Sounds like it's just a way to keep my internet more bogged down for other devices.

Pandora radio app is really nice on it. Lots of programming available on Prime. More on netflix. This unit really shines when you subscribe to multiple services. The fire tv unit itself it great, very responsive and easy to navigate. Dissapointed that virtually all TV series on Prime are pay per view like iTunes. Kinda like it teases you: \"here I am but you can't have me unless you buy me.\"  I'm used to Netflix where its all included in your monthly charge.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "MICHAEL W MARQUIS"}]
