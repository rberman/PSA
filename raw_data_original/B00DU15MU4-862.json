Should have read the reviews closer, I would have found that if you use Comcast as your cable provider HBO Go will not work with Fire TV, at this time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/8", "author": "Big Jake"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "How does the stick differ from the fire TV is simple.  The Fire TV is a beast in a little box and not bad as a cable box replacement.  The Fire TV is much faster and powerful enough that it can locate a broader range of  wireless connections than the stick for example you can be a few floors down and still get good connectivity.  The Fire TV actually comes with more in reference to software you can download than the Fire TV stick.  I wasn't aware that the unit was also a gaming system with the separate controller.  Also remember that they TV has more downloaded content than the stick. The remote control is voice activated which is cool.  Voice activation really works best with amazon prime account so you can call an actors name and get all the films he stared in.  For other features as Netflix, you can only ask for Netflix to bring the app up.  It's definitely worth the money in reference to the range of the device.  Also going to need to buy a separate HDMI cable so keep that in mind.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Gift Card \"New Godzilla\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kim"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's great aside from the, \"HEY HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THIS AMAZON GARBAGE?!?!\" Banner ads at the top of the page...and cluttered throughout the other video offerings.
