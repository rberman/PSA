If you are 1 star and 2 star reviewing this device...you have no idea what Amazon has made for you, how \"open\" they have left it and you probably never heard of Kodi or \"side loading\".  Google them, buy the stick again and do a do over.  You won't be disappointed.  The only reason you'd need the box over the stick is two fold: 1. You game (which I can't see folks doing with any degree of seriousness) 2. You have an old surround sound system (like me) that doesn't have an hdmi port for digital sound and need the optical jack.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mjnforth"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "its ok not great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We are loving the fire t.v.
