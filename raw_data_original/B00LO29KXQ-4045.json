I will be upfront and admit that I love both.  I was torn between buying the Fire Stick and the Fire TV.  I went with the least expensive option, and I'm so glad I did.  For less than $50, I was streaming Netflix, Prime Videos, HBO, etc. within 10 minutes of opening the box.  You literally plug the stick into an HDMI port, plug it into an electrical source, and enter your wifi password.  That's it. I have not had the issues others have reported with having to unplug and replug the stick to get it work.  On my home network we have 3 ipads, 2 ipods, 1 Kindle Fire, 1 apple tv, and now the Fire Stick.  No issues with connectivity at all! (Using the Xfinity blast internet from Comcast.)I highly recommend downloading the remote app to control the stick; the tiny remote is limited and takes forever to search or type. My fav perk - Netflix on my ipad gives me a one button option to send the movie/show right to my tv for viewing.  I can then control the pause, fast forward, rewind, changing shows through my ipad instead of the tiny remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rust and Stardust"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received my Amazon Fire Stick setup was very simple. Be warned that the remote is very difficult to slide off to put in batteries. Other than that 5 minute setup and you are watching movies.

Had to buy a longer HDMI cable to move the Stick away from the TV set to stop the interference. After that it works fine and has a good selection of media..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "jar"}]
