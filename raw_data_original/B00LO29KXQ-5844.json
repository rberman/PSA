Previously I was using my BD player to access my Prime content. This is a huge improvement over that.Installation is about as simple as can be.  Simply plug it into an HDMI port and plug in the power source.  It automatically goes through some checks and setup and all you have to do is put in your password to your wireless network.  A short video plays to introduce you to some features and use of the remote.  Of course, you have figured out the remote a little already because you had to enter a password with the remote.The stick is on all the time so when you want to use it, you do not have to wait for it to boot up like I had to do with the BD player.  Compared to using a BD player, access and start times are pretty much instantaneous.  You can rapidly scan through selections and when you hit play, it starts right up.  There is no spinning wheel while the video loads as there is with the BD player.Picture quality is excellent and seems to be full HD quality.  It is at least as good if not better than I receive from Dishnetwork.You can plug the stick into an HDMI port on your TV, but I plugged mine into an HDMI port on my surround sound receiver.  The stick provides full surround sound through my receiver so I can fully enjoy the videos along with great sound.The menu is a little different than my BD player provided but is simple and straight forward so you will adapt very quickly.My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is the search function.  The search is a general search which means it searches all content-TV, movies, Prime, rentals and purchasing content.  You do not know if your results are a free video or a paid offering until you click on it.  I would like a separate search within Prime for free movies and TV and a different search for rentals.  You can browse through the Prime content and sort by genres but it is more time consuming than a dedicated search.There is an app to use your smart phone as a voice controlled remote, but I have not tried it.  Seems like a gimmick to me and and time saved with voice control would be offset with the time take to load up the app.  Besides, everyone needs one more remote on your end table.Good product at a good price and I would buy it again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Recorder \"js\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It duplicates the streaming function that came on my $80 blu-ray player, and the GUI is slicker, except...  the remote sucks (small, not backlit), and since it's bluetooth, I can't integrate with my harmony remote.  It's also wireless, so the resolution isn't as good as my wired blu-ray player.  It also gets hot, so I wonder about leaving it powered up all the time.

The performance is good, much better than Roku at the price point, I've been using it over my Apple TV (3rd generation). I enjoy having the new app interfaces for apps such as Netflix which still hasn't made it to Apple TV (design). For the first few days for some reason it deemed my 5Ghz wifi band as out of range and then suddenly showed it as very good signal. Bugs like this I'll assume will be fixed through future updates. The interface could use some work, like adding the ability to arrange apps as you please. It does push Amazon content which is to be expected. It's nice to have direct Amazon prime video access as opposed to using AirPlay to push the content. Overall satisfied with purchase.

One for my lovely kid and one for my lovely wife.Installed the first one the day I got them in my kid's bedroom (it was a Tuesday, I think). Everything worked like a charm. He didn't use it (tried to use it) till the weekend. Surprise! It wasn't working: First of all, the remote controller is totally misconfigured, Most keys have their intended action swapped with other keys. After a while, I manage to figure out the \"new layout\" of the keys only to find out that it can't get connected to the previously authorized network. It keeps reporting Authentication problem and, obviously, got disconnected. Device reports signal as strong although it got down to poor when authenticating. I've tried \"forgetting\" the network and re establishing it to no avail.Yes, you guess it. Now my lovely boy is an angry boy.I gave up and tried the second one (which was still in its box). This time I installed it in the kitchen. Same thing: It got connected perfectly by the time I installed it. And it kept working like that for a few days. Woohoo!Until it couldn't authenticate anymore. This is showing exactly the same behavior except for the controller: It is -still- working fine.Yup, now my lovely wife is mad at me. Thank you Amazon! What a way to start this Xmas season!I tried to convince her telling that now she has a nice 32\" digital photo frame thanks to Amazon but it didn't work either. She told me that she couldn't even change the pictures.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Williams Castillo \"Will\""}]
