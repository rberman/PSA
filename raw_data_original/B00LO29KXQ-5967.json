Not difficult to set up.  Lots of good shows ---many classics from PBS, for example ---- and gorgeous clarity on my big screen HDTV.  Nice to download free music from the Amazon Prime website.  Haven't yet accessed all the bells and whistles, but I'm leaning more daily about the benefits as I explore the sites.

I am able to look at my Netflix and Amazon prime movies without any additional charge. If I miss an episode of Scandal or want to see a newer movie, I can just pay a small fee of like 3 bucks per episode on Amazon! I can also listen to my Spotify music without any problems! There are many other features that I plan to discover soon. It was also super easy to just plug into the back of my TV. I bought two and really regret not getting three.
