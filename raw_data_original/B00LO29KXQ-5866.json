[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Update: The Wi-Fi connectivity now seems to be working great. Perhaps there was an update at some point. For the price, it is a great device. I like the user interface of my Roku3 much better. The amazon Fire TV stick puts Amazon's services front and center on the home screen, and it is a slight hassle to get to the other services (Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, etc.) The Roku3 interface makes it a little easier to find what you are looking for.Original review: I am having the same problem that some other reviewers have noted. It keeps dropping Wi-Fi with my router about 30 feet away. I have a Roku3 in the same place and it gets a consistent signal. Perhaps with a longer HDMI extender I could put the stick in front of my TV and that might work. The extender cable that comes with the Fire Stick is only ~5 inches long. Otherwise it seems to be an amazing amount of functionality for the price. I am disappointed that I will not be able to use it. I will play with it a little more to see if I can get it to work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Peter Cardillo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Its a very good way to use my Prime subcripition.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Winford Stell"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have been using a Roku for a couple years and it started acting up so I was looking for a reasonably priced replacement. The Fire Stick was on sale for $25 and although I like the Roku better, it is a great device for  the price(even at $35 I'd say it's worth it). I bought another at the $25 price to put on one of our other TV's.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris H Linker"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This did not worked with my Toshiba TV.Amazon customer care tried few times to fix the problem of Audio but finally gave up.I returned and bought Roku.Cheers,", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "V.

I also installed the remote app on my kindle and my cell phone.  Looking forward to playing with them since you can use voice commands with the apps.
