[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I ordered 2 of the Fire TV Sticks and although they work ok, it was ALREADY REGISTERED to my amazon account!!  Amazon automatically registers the stick to your account, so BEWARE if you are giving this as a gift.  I had to unregister/deactivate these devices from my account.  Also, this device can only be used when inserted in a side hdmi port (so you can use the remote of course), but my hdmi ports are in the back of my tv.  An hdmi extension is included, but it is too short to bring the stick out from the back of my tv to the front where I can control it.  The extension wire should should be at least 24\".  I have always used the Roku boxes and never the sticks because of the fact that my hdmi ports are located in the back of the tv, but I was able to get the Fire sticks at the sale price of $19.99 and wanted to see how they worked and then give as gifts.  I think its ok! for the price of $19.99, but if I had to spend $40.00 I would stick with the Roku box for $10.00 more and be able to connect to any tv with composite or hdmi ports.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "R.

This seems to have fixed the stuttering video I was experiencing with Plex. I have changed my review from 1 star to 4 stars.I purchased this mainly to use as a Plex client. Performance has been lackluster though. Not sure if it is Amazon's fault or Plex not being fully optimized for the device, but about every 5-10 minutes of watching a video, it will pause and stutter making the experience pretty horrible. Hopefully this can be fixed with a software update. I have not had any issues streaming those same videos to an Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/5", "author": "P.

The sound from my Onkyo 7.1 receiver is not as good as the Roku 2. I have this firetv connected directly to one of the HDMI ports of the  receiver.The base does not come on as strong as the Roku and is not as crisp, even if the movies on the Amazon and Netflix app is 5.1 surround. Another complaint I have is the Plex app. I have the lifetime plex pass but when I downloaded this app from the Amazon App store, I have to pay $4.99 for it. My Roku and my Samsung Smartv does not even charge for this app. I feel like I had been had. I did download it anyway, but was disappointed with the app. It does not even have 5.1 surround with the movies I have. I don't even know how to return that app.Maybe plex and firetv will fix the audio for this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "AQS"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We have a Fire TV, andwhen I saw the Fire Stick, I had to have one for the office to free up a monitor.

The lack of settings is what earns this review score from me for the time being. Want to watch Twitch.tv? Hope you enjoy your 360p/480p! Want to change it to HD or source? Nope. Can't do it. Netflix streaming in SD for some ungodly reason that makes no sense while every other device in your house works fine (tablet, phone, 3x PCs, netbook, PS3, PS4) and you want it to stream in HD? Too bad again! The isn't really a help file for any of this yet anyway due to how new the product is, so you can't trouble-shoot it yet. There isn't a way to verify up/down speed on the device which would probably go a long way to figuring out why there are streaming issues at times. But hey, I can pick which network I want to connect to, so that's nice.2014-11-28The wireless router is now within 4 feet of the Fire TV Stick. I still have issues maintaining a solid connection with Netflix, although I am getting very familiar with the rotating percent loading circle. My internet connection is 20Mbps down/6Mbps up, no issues when streaming through my home theater PC. There is also the fun issue of a nice audio \"pop\" when starting any video on my receiver. At this rate, I figure I'll give it another week tops before returning it to Amazon.2014-12-01Factory reset the device. Ironically, it still has no issue playing video or music from Amazon, just... everything else. Netflix consistently has to stop and rebuffer around the 2-3 minute mark. Based on other reviews, I'm not sure if I got a lemon, or if others aren't using it for Netflix and not seeing the same issues I am.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Andy A"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "For the price, it's a good little device.  The software downloads took an extremely long time...over 30 minutes.  Perhaps the servers were overloaded at the time...not sure why it would have taken so long.  Once the update was completed, it worked great.  No buffering issues, seamless playback.  I wish it was compatible with Vudu/Ultraviolet, but I'll have to be content using Flixster to watch our UV movies.  The biggest issue I have is the lack of a remote app for my Kindle Fire.  Currently, only Kindles with a microphone are compatible.  Honestly, I could care less about using voice recognition for search features...I just want to utilize a keyboard for typing rather than having to spend time scrolling through an onscreen \"keyboard\" with the remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "S.
