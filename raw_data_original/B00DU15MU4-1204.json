Ok, I'm not the most advanced techno whiz in the universe but even I can install, register and use the Amazon Fire for TV without calling my husband or best friend for \"tech support!!\" Especially love the voice activation feature, took a few attempts with enunciation but the device quickly absorbed my voice and responds well. Definitely recommend :)!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kathy M \"Kathy M.\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Did not work with my Sharp Aquos's HDMI port.

The apps work really well and are seamless for Netflix and Hulu as well. We'd love it if we could get the Showtime anytime and HGTV apps on it.

Love love love this device.  Purchased one to test out but will be buying more so that we can get rid of cable  and overcharging by cable company.

I'm a NETFLIX user.  I got Amazon Fire to see if they have different movie than Netflix.  They do!  They also seem to have more TV-series on Amazon Fire.

I've encountered bug after bug after bug.  Apps keep logging me out (I.E. Netflix), the voice search only searches Amazon's stuff, some apps don't close properly and I have to press the back button over and over and over again, EVERYTHING is 'cloud' based so if you lose connection it's a brick, completely random freezes and restarts (like in the middle of a movie and no update random).Also after using it for so long I'm starting to feel like the home screen is just redundantly crammed with stuff.  Once I start to see the same 2 or 3 series and movies over and over while navigating the home menu I start to question the necessity of a lot of the categories/sub-menu's.  I get it Amazon, you has video.  GMAFB!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Solomon Arrington IV"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Mechanically/digitally great.
