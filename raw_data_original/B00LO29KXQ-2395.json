[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "This product does not compare at all to Apple TV. While Im a prime member, I find that every movie I want to watch requires a rental fee. The platform for searching is not nearly as user friendly as Apple TV. The music does have a kareokee feature which is cool. All the words on the screen. My wife loves that. The movies we have watched doen't seem to show in high resolution on my plasma tv which i find frustrating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Randell S.

My bedroom TV was the only one in the house that did not have Amazon, Netflix, etc... and this gave me everything I wanted. Easy to install and easy to use. As a Prime member there really is no reason not to get this. It does come with an external USB power plug and if your TV does not have powered USB ports you will need to use something like a phone charger to power it. That is about the only downside, but if you read up on the product you would know about that already.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James Waymire \"Rabid Code Monkey\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Information available during pre-order suggested TWC should work - it did and still does not.

However, since receiving my Fire Stick a little under a month ago I'm frustrated with the amount of technical glitches I've experienced.  Network issues, being disconnected automatically,  buffering, and the over sensitivity of the remote drove me mad. I considered returning it to try the roku, which my mom has and it's never given her any troubles.
