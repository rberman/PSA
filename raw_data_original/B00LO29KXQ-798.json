I installed the sticks on 2 different TVs.  The Firestick continually loses it's connection while the Roku never has.  The Firestick is plugged into the wall as recommended.  I switched the sticks onto the opposite TVs to see if location made a difference.  There was no change in performance.  The Roku still worked better.  I ordered another Firestick to see if the original was just bad.
