After a day of use,  here are my thoughts:-I mainly stream Netflix,  hulu plus,  Amazon prime content and Pandora and before this,  I was streaming off blu ray players so I was looking for a more direct and smoother interface.-I also feel duped by the stick needing to be plugged into a power adapter since amazons description mentioned nothing about it but due to my tv/media stand/power strip setup,  it turned out to be a non issue for me.-Initial setup on the TV in my room which is furthest from the router was a bit of a pain because it took three tries to get it to update.  This may have been due in part to reception in there being unstable at times. May also be due in part to Amazon server being overloaded.Set up on the TV in the living room that is closest to the router was a breeze.-For those complaining about the battery compartment.. I had zero issues with both of mine.  Simply apply pressure to the top where the bar imprint is and slide down.  Took me 2-3 tries on each but came off easily.-After updating in the bedroom TV,  I tried playing Netflix and it rebuffered three times in 3 minutes,  then when you pressed any button on the remote,  the lag between press and something happening was a 30+ seconds.  Not a good start.  I restarted the stick and everything has been good since.  The living room TV has had zero issues so far.-Overall, I'm happy with the stick so far especially at the price I paid for it. It does what I want it to do,  streams HD smoothly and stays out of my line of sight.  I also really like that the stick doesn't require you to turn it on and off.  As long as it's plugged into a power adapter,  it will turn off after 30 minutes of no use and turn right back on to where you left off when you turn your TV on. The remote is also nice and simple and you don't have to point it at anything in particular to get it to work.I will update this review if anything changes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Desirella"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to set up, easy to use.

The setup was easy and straightforward.  Great product that will only improve as more apps become available.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt H"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So I won't go into as much detail as other reviewers.Reasons I like it- Perfect for the tv in the bedroom.- Plenty of applications for us (costumers)- It was $20- Comes with a remote.Reasons I don't like it- Doesn't have xfinity to go- Doesn't allow mirroring of iOS- Limited game selection- Doesn't like being USB'd into my cable box- Remote feels cheap and could break easy (Both plus and negative)ConclusionIt is hard to pick apart the features when the Fire Stick cost 19.99, If i paid full price I would say I wouldn't have gone with it. It is just easier to bring my laptop into the bedroom and hook it up to my tv, since I didn't pay full price 4/5 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Shaun Santos"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy with the operation of the fire stick.

It works fine and seems good quality but I didn't know it was a lesser version and didn't come with the voice commands.  Even the instructions talk about voice command but it isn't there.  Be careful what you order.  Amazon usually stands behind there products very well but I feel duped on this one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/5", "author": "BuffaloBill"}]
