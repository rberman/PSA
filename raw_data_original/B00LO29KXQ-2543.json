My router is in my office and the stick kept loosing connection. I mean constantly. I Do want to note that Crome cast and my smart tv have had to problem connecting and streaming. Also when connecting it said my connection was \"very good\", obviously not. Read a few other reviews and saw similar issues. So... ***NOTE*** only get this if your router is in the same room as your tv*****I ended up buying a wifi extender and now it seems to be working but still not quite as seamless as other devices. I got this so I can try out sling and so far it is working pretty good streaming live TV. If I could go back would probably go Roku stick to avoid having to buy a wifi extender.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ben sparling"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "it's okey...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sebastian P."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We also have an apple TV and the Fire stick is much faster!

Now the stick is all setup for Amazon Prime movies, music, games and whatever. I was disappointed that Netflix wasn't preset  \"ready to go\",  seems that it can be done but there was no instruction included on how to setup Netflix or other entertainment providers. Maybe the info was there somewhere and I just missed it.
