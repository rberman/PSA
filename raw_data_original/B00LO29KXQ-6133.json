It's easy to install/navigate and works off your existing WiFi.  Amazon, Hulu, Netflix etc... all in one place makes for convenient access to all your favorite shows.  If I was to seek an improvement it would be on the streaming side.  I live in an older house in the country so my internet isn't overly fast.  Streaming video works fine on the computer but with the Fire Stick it buffers quite a bit.  Dropping the resolution doesn't seem to help.  That being said, even with slow internet, it's not been that much of an issue.  Still an A+ in my book.  This is a great resource for someone looking to get rid of cable/satellite.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Nate93077"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is fab.

Right away I had a couple problems with the Fire TV Stick.  I initially plugged it in to my Samsung 20\" LCD.  After the splash screen, I got no picture.  Tried several different things over the course of an hour with no luck.  I then tried another television and it worked.  This is the first HDMI device that did not work with this samsung TV.  Compared with ROKU I found the content quite limited, All of the major content was there(Netflix; hulu; youtube; etc) but there was no where near the content available that was available on the Roku.  Also, unlike the ROKU I hade to use the supplied power dongle.  If I tried plugging the USB into the TVs USB port like I did with the ROKU, I got an error message that the power was not adequate.  I also noticed that the video would get a little choppy compared to the ROKU even though I used it on the same TV in the same location with the same service(HULU).  This was really obvious with the screen mirroring from my android device.  With the ROKU the video was smooth and with the Fire TV Stick it was choppy.  All in all this device is OK and may be preferred for a less techy user.  Adding channels to the ROKU can get a little confusing.  Since this is version 1 of the device, I think that it will improve with later versions.  The chromecast streaming stick is not nearly as good as either the ROKU or the FireTV stick.  Also this device supports WIDI/Miracast. If you have a PC with Windows 8.1 that supports WIDI/Miracast, you will be able to mirror your PC screen to either the FireTV or the ROKU.....However, it seems that PCs that support this intel standard are not readily available.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "pookie"}]
