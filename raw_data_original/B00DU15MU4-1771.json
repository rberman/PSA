I am not big on watching TV despite having a monster sized big screen.  Prior to buying Fire TV, I just watched favorite movies or TV shows via Prime on my iMac.I bought Fire TV and now seriously enjoy the Prime selections of shows and music.  The Fire TV interface is intuitive and easily matches what I have available via the iMac or even my new Fire Kindle 7.Between Fire TV and Kindle Fire...
