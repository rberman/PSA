The number of movies, TV shows, apps, and games available is great! (Especially w/ Prime!) Accessing things is really quick and the voice-text search (the little microphone) is AWESOME - works amazingly quick and accurately! I'm really happy with the # of new release movies and recent TV series. (especially since it's summer and a lot of my favs are in reruns!) I bought the game controller and was impressed that it could also work with movies/TV play/pause/FF etc. (the regular Fire TV remote is pretty small - nice feature but sometimes gets lost in the other stuff on the table!) Love it! Would recommend it! Am extremely happy with it!

I can't say enough GOOD about this product. This was by far the best decision we ever made. I was spending roughly $230 for high speed internet and cable with Com*#$T. Now with our fire TV, Sling TV app, antenna and high speed internet only, my cost is roughly $100 to $110. I received a prorated bill from the above cable/internet provider with credits and charges (I'm sure most of you know how their billing system is ridiculously hard to make heads or tails out of.) so next month I will have a solid idea on the true cost. We get a great picture, very rarely do we have an issue with the streaming. SO many apps to choose from with many being free and some with minimal charge like Sling TV. We love it and I thought I would miss cable terribly, NOT It feels very liberating to have cut that cord! Take the leap, you wont regret it! If you sign up for Amazon Prime you will also have a nice list of movies to watch for free as well on your Fire TV.
