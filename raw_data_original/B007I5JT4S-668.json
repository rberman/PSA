Lloyd \"JRTL\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I bought this to allow vendors to Airplay on to my large format display, to this end the product is a failure.  The key issue is that both devices must attach to the same network, unfortunately Apple TV will not do Enterprise Security, and you can't likely allow a vendor to join that network even if you could.  Needless to say this is not for use around any business network.  As for home, I have a ROKU box that gives me infinitely more choices than Apple TV.  Basically, if you have an Ipad or Iphone, Airplay at home would be cool, but on the whole this product fails as a streaming media player, you are essentially limited to Itunes, Netflix, MLB, and a couple useless other channels.

The music is easy enough to access and play, however the fidelity is not first-rate quality. My ITunes library is mostly recorded from CDs in Wave or Apple Lossless  format, which works perfectly when copied to CDs, yet the sound of the same music is decidedly thinner and sibilant when streamed through the Apple TV. It is OK for background or casual listening, but critical listening sessions are unrewarding. Likewise, eventhough the promotion makes the case that the steaming is 1080P, the video shows decided compression effects.The result is a useful product, but do not expect the sound or video to be a mirror of the same content one generation prior.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

I won't get into the details as all the other reviews cover most of the plus points. I'll just offer some lessons from my learning curve.For those with a high-end A/V system and planning on using a Logitech 900 remote, I'll just say this was fairly easy to set up under \"activities\". Tip: you won't find a \"logical\" category for it in the remote set-up guide, so instead look for it under \"computers/Media PC\" and type in Apple TV as the device. I have this little guy tucked away in a closet in the bedroom and controlled by the RF blaster. It's hooked up to my Harmon Kardon A/V system using the optical cable for sound with video through HDMI. Wi-fi is over a newer dual-band Cisco router. No problems at all streaming HD movies at 1080i!One other tip for those planning to stream video through iTunes. When converting/ripping HD movies (720 or 1080) using handbrake or some other program make sure to set your fps rate to 30. Anything less, and you'll get very \"choppy\" almost slow-motion output to the TV. I tested every scenario to try to fix this problem until realizing it was the fps setting! Also keep in mind that ATV does NOT play all types of files and MPEG4 (MP4) is the preferred type. Some formats such as MKV, AVI and others will not load into iTunes and subsequently ATV. You'll need to \"jailbreak\" it to be able to use other formats (Someone please let me know when you figure it out..haha!!).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BMS \"As I see it.\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Apple TV module is everything it says it is.  But it only works if you have blazing fast Internet service.  Six Mbps DSL won't cut it.  You have to have at least twice that much or there are unacceptable buffering issues.  I'd also recommend the latest Apple AirPort wireless router.  BUT, after you have all the pieces together, you can do all sorts of cool things.  I'm not here to tell you about all the features.  Just to tell you what you need to access them.  I'd recommend this over digital cable any day.

The quality of video it streams is great and I can access all the things I want. I have Netflix, my favorite shows, movies, video podcasts and more.

I never did hook it up, always next weekend's project, although the hookup is ridiculously easy. I never could get the Apple TV out of my head. Yes, it offers less services than Roku but as with all or most Apple products, the ease of use and seamless integration with other Apple devices can't be beat. I hooked up the Apple TV the day I got it. Just FYI, if you go through an HDMI switch you can't get sound without a toslink digital audio cable, at least I couldn't. No problem, I bought a toslink 1:3 switch on Amazon a while back so connecting the Apple TV with HDMI for video and toslink for audio was a breeze. Using Air Play in Mountain Lion and iOS 5 and 6 (Macbook Pro and Air, iPad 3rd gen, and iPnone 5 respectively) was just as seamless as advertised. There is a bit of lag but that's to be expected in Central Florida with the broadband traffic. Even with the slight lag, the ability to stream video and audio so easily is terrific. My iTunes Match music showed up almost immediately on my Samsung HD TV and in another couple of seconds the music started playing through my theater system. I inevitably have to bring work home so seeing my desktop on the big TV screen is a nice alternative, especially when I'm using my 11\" MAcbook Air.Because I haven't hooked up the Roku, i can't say how its video and audio compare. Of course it doesn't do Air Play so there is no streaming from Apple devices to the TV.So why the 4 stars for the Apple TV? Even with my small hands, using the remote is frustrating. It's just so small that I'm forever pressing it incorrectly, causing delays when trying to navigate or type in passwords etc. I actually have to press it with my nail instead of the pad of my finger in order to be accurate. Also, the display on the Macbooks becomes so tiny when using Air Play that I can barely see it, although there's probably a way to adjust this other than by increasing the magnification manually.All in all, I don't regret my purchase. I'm not reinventing the wheel when I say that if you have a lot of Apple stuff, the Apple TV is the way to go. If not, the Roku may be the better choice.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gaedfly"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love the the Apple TV. Although it isn't mature enough for myself, it still feels like there is room to grow, it is growing and becoming a better product and is already a great device for most people. I bought it once Hulu was announced because I ditched TV and wanted a low power media streamer that had Netflix and Hulu. With this last update to iOS 5.1 for the Apple TV, it added the ability to move icons which I think is pretext to Apps, which would make this a killer device. I am already exited for the possibilities this brings to it. I would recommend buying if you already have any of the Apple Ecosystem like the iPad, iPhone, iPod or Macbook.Pros:Low Power UsageHas Netflix and HuluCan stream my media from iTunesCan use my iOS devices as a remoteCan stream pictures and video from my iPhone to Apple TV with easeCan stream my Macbook screen to Apple TV with easeNEW: Can stream from Apple TV to Airplay speakers!Cons:Making it sleep is kind of a pain, you need to force it in settings or wait 15 mins. I wish there was a button combo...No Apps... yet...Apple UI paradigm is forced on Netflix and Hulu, which isn't optimal for themWish i could remove/delete/hide sports apps", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adam V"}]
