Currently I much prefer my Roku stick and there is one big reason why. All the optional or hidden channels that you can access through Roku. Amazon does not have anything like that and honestly that is what is killing the Fire TV Stick for me. I understand the desire of Amazon to be able to control what content a person can utilize by their product, I have an iPhone 6 and that is something Apple is famous for doing. Still though, when the leader in the industry offers more options right away, it should tell Amazon that they needed to do the same thing. It's not a bad product if you haven't used any other internet TV streaming option before, it is just lacking if you have. Yes I know I can play games with this, and I do, it isn't what I watch tv for though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love the Fire TV Stick, it's fantastic.  We used to run a long HDMI cable across the room from our MacBook Pro but now this Stick eliminates it.
