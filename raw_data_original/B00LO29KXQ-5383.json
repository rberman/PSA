However, after installing it, we still can't use it.  I FINALLY found the HDMI setting on my TV remote, but still there is no response from the stick or the stick remote.  I put in the batteries that came with the stick.  Any advice?I was hoping it was wireless, as we went to great lengths to have all of our TV wires unexposed.  The commercials imply that it is wireless.I had to put the star rating so this would go through.  If I can get it to work, it will be five stars, I'm sure.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kathy G.

I didn't really need it, as I am OK with my Apple TV (which admittedly is getting a little long in the tooth, app-wide). I find it to be a great diversion on my iMac second screen, which is a 24inch Samsung Syncmaster. It DOES need the included power adapter, so figure that into your power management layout if you order it.It's fast, small and installs easily and works right out of the box.  Good starter group of apps and games.  I use it for Huluplus and Netflix mostly after the work day, but as a Primer, the occasional free movie is a nice touch, also.  I'm looking forward to HBO GO coming to the Stick in the Spring which will make it worthwhile, if priced right.  I'm not a big gamer (OK, not a gamer at all, truth be told) although I do appreciate the nice growth in the game graphics arena over the years.  I have found myself jumping into some of the games with the Stick also much to my surprise (I hope their record sales increases game availability), which begs the question, why not games on Apple TV?  No internal Xbox or PS4 product to protect from cannibalization and it's not like Apple to be asleep at the wheel!  I guess they are making so much money now on phones, their 'leading edge' is becoming dulled, which gives other firms running room to grab marketshare AND mindshare...but I digress.The Stick doesn't have a ton of memory on it, but way more than its competitors, from the view of future growth of games and operating system upgrades.  At this point, I would rank the Stick over the Chromecast dongle and the Roku stick on quality, speed and price.  Pick one up and invest in your future entertainment, especially if you are part of the Amazon 'sphere of influence'.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles M.
