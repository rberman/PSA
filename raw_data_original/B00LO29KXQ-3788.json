The first few days it worked great. I was loving how I can easily watch Netflix but then it would disconnect from our Wi-Fi network. This happened frequently throughout the day and it's extremely frustrating. The help page recommended that I reboot my Wi-Fi router but all my other devices were working fine, they also recommended i uninstall the YouTube app, which I couldn't do because I never installed it in the first place and I reboot it several times a day which most of the time fails. I would refund but my high expectations resulted in me throwing away the original box so I'm kinda stuck with it. Such a waste of money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karla Avalos"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Product as advertised and arrived on time, great product....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dowens21"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I am very pleased with the firestick.
