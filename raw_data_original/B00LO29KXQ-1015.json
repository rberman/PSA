I wish it were easier to use (the way it's set up is a bit confusing, like compiling a place where all of your apps are neatly organized), but I use this all of the time. It has a really great selection of apps, though I only ever use Netflix, Prime, YouTube, and MLB.tv.It's a bit expensive, that's my only major dislike.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Rachel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazon fire stick is so much better than I thought it would be.
