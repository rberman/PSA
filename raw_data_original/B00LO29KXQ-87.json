I was disappointed in that I could not find some of the apps to which I had become accustomed on the purple competitor.  Font size in menus was difficult to read from a distance at which most large screen TVs are viewed. Basically, I found nothing advantageous to this stick versus the purple competitor.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "steven c. martz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "100% recomendado", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "hespina"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love how it came already setup with my info", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "anthony ranze"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tracy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is literature the most amazing little device!
