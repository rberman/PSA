He actually bought my first one for me and I decided I liked it so much I bought one for the TV in another room. I realize this is easily inserted from TV to TV, but I wanted the ease of just turning on my TV and having access when I wanted it.  I can also take this to work and put it on my TV at work.  This takes all of my digital viewing everywhere I want to watch it.  I am extremely please with the ease of set up and how quickly I can navigate with this fire stick.  I am not computer or tech savvy and this was a breeze for me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tammie \"Scrapper Mom\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bianca Garcia"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this!
