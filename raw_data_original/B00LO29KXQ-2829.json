First I was happy that even without cable I could access my local channels, including an astounding number of channels from Mexico. However I missed my cable channel array. . .until I discovered the Fire TV stick!!! Just the one-time one purchase price of around $39.00. Oh, my goodness!!! I can now do my own programming choices, rent movies, access netflick, sling and even listen to non-stop news from CBS!!! I have not scratched the surface in exploring what it has to offer. Easy to set up, I am a grandmother without an IT background and it was a snap. One hiccup, but just unplugged for 3 minutes and plugged back in. I am no longer paying the cable company over one thousand dollars a year and I can choose what to watch. My rating Super plus plus!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Janet Monteros"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Mostly this has worked well for us. We had earlier tried a chrome stick. The chrome stick seemed less reliable and I believe hackers used it to get into my home network. The Kindle fire stick did fail a couple of times, but I restarted pretty easily and has been working well overall.Granted, I tried the chrome stick for about a year before using the Fire TV stick, so the technology may have improved.The remote is very helpful, but would be GREAT to have a volume control.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GJ Seattle \"Seattle Shopper\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good quality and fast downloads... easy-to-use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "victor"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best entertainment ever!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Laila63"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

Id does everything is says it does and with the new update from Amazon, it's even better. Could not be happier. In fact I would buy this BEFORE Apple TV or Google.
