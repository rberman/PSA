The price is reasonable.  However, I have had to unplug and replug it multiple times in its first week of use. Even when I know for sure my internet is running fast, shows stop in the middle. I bought the fire stick because I wanted to access my Prime Videos easily, but I regret the purchase.  It's just not consistent with streaming.  With this kind of issue the fact that it was easy to install and a good price doesn't matter one bit.  So far, I consider it a piece of junk.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rebecca Hoff"}]
