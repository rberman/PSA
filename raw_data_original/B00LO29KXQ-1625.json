I use Time Warner Cable and eventually replaced this with Roku sticks since Roku supported the TWC app to watch the channels instead of a rented box.  I have Xbox's too that can do it but it much simpler to not power up the Xbox's just to watch TV.The remote is fine (like Roku), the speed is fine (like Roku), and its just as easy to connect as anything else like it is.This Amazon stick works OK, but does not have the content of Roku -- simple as that.  Roku also has Amazon Prime so I see no need to have the Amazon stick instead as it offers less than Roku.If these were $10 and you did not care about TWC, then these would be OK.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.
