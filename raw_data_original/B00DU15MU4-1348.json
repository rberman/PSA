Speaking to the remote to perform the action I requested usually works well. Every once in a while it comes up with some crazy response but it is not really a problem. Almost no buffering at all. Picture quality is great as well. I have only had to reboot the unit twice when the audio started to sound strange but, with the reboot, it fixed that issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Phillip J.
