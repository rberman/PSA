I wish there wasn't a need for an external power source, but a small sacrifice for what you get. For the price, it doesn't get much better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kibok"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Very upset that Fire Stick wasn't able to stay connected to WIFI.

The access to your music and cloud drive photos Is awesome! Netflix works perfect, Prime Video perfect as well. It's nice and small and can make any HD into a smart TV. I was using the X Box to watch Prime Videos and Netflix but now use this device. Setup is very simple, great instructions play on your TV as soon as it's turned on the first time.I am going to buy another one after Christmas for other TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrew"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I only gave it a 4 star because I'm not sure about what's happening. but about every 6-7 days I have to unplug it and let it cool because it will freeze up and I don't know if it is suppose to do that or not.

We have a fair amount of content with Amazon, and a Prime membership, so it was a no-brainer. I'm thinking this could be the device that unifies the streaming on our main  TV to be easier for my spouse.It was also a no-brainer to set up: plug it into the TV, plug in power(my TV didn't have enough power from either the HDMI port, nor from the USB port, which the Fire TV Stick detected and recommended the adapter). The TV recognized it immediately. After putting in my WiFi password, everything was up and running--including a decent video tutorial that kept us entertained during breakfast. BTW, that's how long it took to set up: long enough to drink my coffee and eat my oatmeal before before the work commute.I'm looking forward to checking out the apps and the content, which is much easer to view and access than through the smart TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SciFiFreak"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "My main irk with the Fire TV Stick was the buffering -- at first. I was about to send it back but I'm pretty sure I fixed that issue. This was purchased to get the kids' Xbox and PS4 out of the living room and finally not have to rely on those devices to stream from the Internet. So, all went swimmingly with installation and wifi connecting. I settled in to give it a go and watch a show and it started, then buffer.... played... buffered... played... buffered, and so on. A message came up about the wifi not being strong enough (or something like that). Oh this can't be happening.So, I did what I do if ever any video on Youtube or any other website stalls and buffers -- I pushed the back/rewind button to let it go back and re-play something I've already seen to give it time to get the rest of the video queued up. And lo and behold, everything after that played just fine. No more buffering. I watched several shows without incident. I'm giving one less star due to the hassle, but am very happy with Amazon's new Fire TV Stick. For now. I hope this helps others having the same issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrea Cruz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love It.
