[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my Fire TV Sticks - yes, sticks . . . I got two of them.  One for the bedroom and one for the living room.  Love them!  Cable has a million stations and some days, nothing to watch.  But there is *always* something to watch on my Amazon Fire TV Stick.  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to expand their viewing options. As always, Amazon delivered on time and in good order.

It redirect to the network connection screen every few minutes and shows a strong signal then drops again as soon as you try to view anything. Doesn't work with Xfinity X1 system. According to Amazon Customer Service this is a known issue. Their advice was to downgrade my X1 router by disabling IPv6. All my computers rely in IPv6 for the strongest download speeds so NO I will not downgrade my router settings. Since the fire stick only works using the older IPv4 technology it's useless to me. I spent three weeks with customer support trying to get to the problem and now they tell me it's too late to return it after 4 weeks. WTF. In to the trash it goes.
