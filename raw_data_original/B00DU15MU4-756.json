Has previews or first episode but everything else is at an hefty cost.This device is more like a way to buy programs from Amazon.Installation is really easy, but finding something to watch is not. That would be so much easier with some kind of keyboard. Instead you have to spin that wheel letter per letter and basically you have to know what you are looking for.
