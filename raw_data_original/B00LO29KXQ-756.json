We use it much more than I thought.While there's plenty of video content for adults and kids, what I really like is the ability to play Amazon Music through the home-entertainment system. It also adds extra value to being a Prime member. I like the parental code key. It means the kids have to come ask me first if they can watch something. That way they aren't watching stuff without me knowing about it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J.C."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product it knows my Amazon Prime information", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Azodiac"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This stick will catch a lot of people by surprise.  Once you stick it in, you'll be amazed at all the entertainment this holds.This surprisingly has a huge following of unofficial developers that create great apps you may not find with a lot of other devices such as the Chromecast or Roku.  Some of these apps include streaming of a lot of TV Shows and Movies (some not even available on Red Box!).Make the purchase and start saving money.
