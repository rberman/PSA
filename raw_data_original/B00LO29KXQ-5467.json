[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I able to get this for $19 preorder and it works great.  It is way better than the Samsung smart TV apps that were currently on the TV.  It links ups well with my Prime account and Netflixs works well.  If your smart TV has issues or does not have an internet connection this is a great addition.  I have no need for the set top box.  Just a heads up that ontop of plugging this into the HDMI slot you will need to also plug it in for power to a TV USB or use the plug in wall adapter which is much like one that comes with a smartphone.  Oh an you will not have the voice search option sorry if you were looking to sound like Gary Busey.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Todd M \"wolfgang-1\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Set up was easy,made my dumb TV smart!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Double D"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great reception & easy organization.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Inexpensive replacement for Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Huong Luu"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have a Roku 3 that I'm comparing this with.

I actually have 2 now and I don't see myself swapping them out anytime soon. I've used Roku (1st-3rd Gen), Chromecast and some lesser known/off brand devices. All had their strengths and weaknesses. The Fire TV stick plays the \"Big 3\" streaming services (many lack Prime Instant Video), and I got it during the pre-order sale for $20. Here's my rundown:Pros:- Playback is smooth- WiFi connection is solid- Remote is easy to use- Good/easy to use Interface- Unbeatable price when on saleCons:- Remote buttons are a little loud when clicking- Doesn't support MHL for power so it needs to be plugged in", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AC2MO"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got it for the sole purpose of side-loading XBMC, to not have to hook the computer or tablet up to the TV.
