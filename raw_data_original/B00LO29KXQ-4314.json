Not as many apps as my Roku, but for the grandkids room, it is sufficient. If you have Amazon Prime, it is definitely a plus. Once you sign in, it welcomes you by name and has any app you have purchased through Amazon already loaded. I was able to view my security cameras at work because I had purchased the IP Camera Viewer from them.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "esquaredracing"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works perfectly right out of the box.  We love it.  We got the Fire TV for the living room and this for our TV in the bedroom, since we didn't need games or a fancy voice activated remote in there.  ;)  Been very happy with both and mostly with Amazon Prime Video.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jamie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!

The installation was the hardest part for me.  I couldn't get the remote apart to install the batteries but was able to go online and find out that a knife inserted in the seam got it to open.  Then the password became an issue.  After numerous tries I got connected and have been enjoying my choices of movies and tv shows with Amazon Prime. Since we have never had cable this is a real treat to watch \"biggie size\"  and frees up the computer for personal use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Diane B.
