I've been a Roku user for a couple years now, but wanted to get one of the lesser expensive HDMI stick products for the bedroom TV. I picked this one because of several reviewers saying it was faster than the Roku HDMI stick and other similar products. I find the fire TV stick to be very laggy and slow to respond. Some of the apps are very unintuitive. For example, the Pandora app. If you're playing music, then hit the home button on the remote, music keeps playing while you're navigating the device. When I press home, I want it to close the currently open app, not leave it running in the background. You have to actually go to the menu of the Pandora app to stop it. I've also had it freeze up a few times. We've moved it into my daughter's room where it's not used as much, and I plan on getting a standard Roku for the bedroom. I would rather pay the extra $50 and be happy with the product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J. Miller"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this product.
