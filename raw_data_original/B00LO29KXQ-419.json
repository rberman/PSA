[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Pros:It works and the quality for the most part is goodI am curious to know if I can use two of these in two different locations (two houses)Cons:I have not found a way to search for content yet.There needs to be a ton of more movies availableI have a good ISP and I still have issues at times with Streaming content from the Fire TV Stick. I have not had an issue with Movies, but with TV Shows and Apps like YouTube.Suggestions: They should have a feature to show/hide content that cost $$$ or put a \"$\" overlay on the images so you know it will cost you money to view, this would save me so much time from drilling into the details just to find out it cost to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.

The movies and shows freeze (ALOT!!!),  It. is the closest device to the main cable box and WiFi and works worse than my Roku, which is the furthest away.  Sometimes you can't even click on the show you want to view, because it is not visible on the TV even though you bought it.  It's crazy!!!  I would not recommend this product to anyone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Simira Anderson-Davis"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Will not stay connected to WiFi that is 10 ft away.
