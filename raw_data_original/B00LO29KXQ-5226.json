However, we ran into an issue with the Fire Stick not being able to consistently stream the shows we were watching.  It would stop every few minutes to reload.  After several hours of research and experimentation we determined that although the Fire Stick was connected to our Wi-Fi signal it wasn't robust enough to maintain a constant stream of data.  It might work better if it is closer to the router but that's not something that we can change.  Back it goes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Donald J.

You need to plug in your stick to an electrical outlet in addition to plugging it in to the TV HDMI port.  I don't want any more wires/cables to plug in.  Also this does little more than stream services that you must pay for such as netflix, hulu and prime.  Ok fine. If you want to use anything else, ESPN, CBS etc, you must be a paying cable subscriber and jump through a bunch of hoops.  I have a Roku hooked up to another TV in the house.  It does EVERYTHING this Firestick does AND it offers many free \"apps/channels\"  that I don't have to pay for such as EWTN (catholic cable channel), Crackle, other obscure specialty channels, along with streaming of day-old shows from FoxNews (multiple clips from shows like O'Reilly which essentially add up to his whole show minus commercials) and other cable channels (without having to pay for cable).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "SAM \"SAM\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best thing i ever did works  Great just a couple small issues on downloading once in awhile but no big issue and it works fabulous recommend it to everyone what a fabulous unit.down loading could.

I was impressed that the stick came with everything in the box -- when I bought the Roku Streaming Stick, I had to by the HDMI extender cable separately. Once I completed the easy installation, I was also impressed by how snappy the user experience is. But The Fire TV Stick doesn't stand up to the Roku for my family.First, the bugs. More than once it wouldn't connect at all for some time. We've also been logged out of the Netflix app a couple of times.Where it really falls short though is Netflix and other streaming services are second class citizens. When you search for movies, it's only Amazon's service. As a family that started with an Apple TV back in the day and have tried and used many services, and still use a couple, this is a deal breaker.Our young kids found it particularly the multiple steps to go back and forth between Amazon and Netflix. Also, the remote looks slick, but without the buttons for the popular services it is not as kid friendly. Also, the small, slick remote has meant it went missing more frequently than other remotes.I'm returning the Fire TV Stick today. I look forward to checking out Amazon's next versions.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lloyd Dewolf"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "this works great on the non smart TV, as it simply plugs into the HDMi port and streams thru the internet.

So I went ahead and set it up earlier than planned but it was easier that I thought it would be. We all really enjoy this! There is so much variety to choose from that everyone can find something they want to watch. In fact we almost have to schedule times to use the Fire TV stick so that if someone really want to just want a regular TV channel, they can do that too!
