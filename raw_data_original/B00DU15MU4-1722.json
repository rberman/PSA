Usually there is a way to ask questions but I cannot find it for this product.Every product that I have seen for streaming music and movies require you to have your own ISP.  Other than cable, Dish and a few Ethernet connections, data usage is exorbitant.  I have a Verizon Hotspot and it costs $10 per Gb of data usage.  So, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, who offer really low monthly access to volumes of programming sounds like a great deal until you realize what your broadband service provider is going to charge you.If you go to the Hulu website, they estimate one Gb of data usage per hour of standard  quality viewing and up to 3 Gb per hour if viewing high definition, high quality programming.  So, if I watched one hour per night of Hulu content, I would end up paying Verizon for 30 Gbs of streaming data or $300 - HDTV would be $900 for the same 30 hours per month.Am I missing something?  No one seems to be including the cost of your data streaming.  One article estimated the average cable user consumed 300 Gbs of data streaming ($3000 with my Verizon ISP).  Even many of the services and interactive features on Dish satellite expects a customer to use their own broadband - internet connection.If someone knows where an internet provider is charging significantly less for their data usage, please let me know.  (The few that are trying to provide much more data are bundling it in family plans which don\u2019t help individual users very much).Can anyone explain to me why this 500 lb. gorilla is not discussed?", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/8", "author": "Mitch"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love my fire tv. Crazy fast and the voice search work perfectly. Only complaint (and its almost a deal breaker) is the lack of Comcast support for HBO GO and Showtime Anytime. Come on Amazon!
