Amazon is great but this device was not able to stream any video without constantly having to Buffer. If I hook up my laptop I can stream movies using Amazon prime just fine....so it is more of the capability of this device than my internet speed...which is 25mbps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "charles e mirabal"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE!!

I often connect my laptop to the TV to watch my Netflix movies, Amazon streaming, etc.; however, I thought this would be much nicer because I would have a remote and access to additional services (i.e. games).  The problem is that the one game I was excited about - You Don't Know Jack - just doesn't work.  So apparently for the games you need to download an app onto your smart phone.  In this case, an app called JackPad.  Downloaded onto several different phones and not one of them will connect to the device despite going through all of the troubleshooting options.  So that is the big disappointment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Barkygirl"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "stop restricting apps even from your own market, kodi and other run great on this.UPDATE!!!!Why can't the firetv run amazon apps like echo and prime now?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Zendick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love having this.

When I asked the sales executive about it, he confirmed that it was a reliable device to turn a regular led TV into a Smart TV. The problem is that I live in Argentina and when I got back home, I was not able to use any of the options I was interested in. Is there anyway I can connect to my Netflix account for example?
