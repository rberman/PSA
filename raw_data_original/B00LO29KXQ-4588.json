[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really love the fire stick, it's easy to navigate though the menus, setup was very simple. I wish I'd had my husband buy one with his prime account also when they were on predate. I only have one small gripe (or maybe just a heads-up): the stick needs to connect not only to the HDMI port on the tv, but also to a power cable, which wasn't long enough to run though the wall with the rest of our cables. I ended up getting an adapter to plug the stick into an HDMI cable and it sits in the tv shelf with the other consoles, rather than being plugged directly into the back of the tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
