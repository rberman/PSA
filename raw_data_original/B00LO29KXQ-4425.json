This happened for every item I tried earlier. Tonight it happened when trying to watch something on Netflix right after streaming an entire film at high quality... from Amazon Prime. I'm not streaming the exact same thing at high quality from my old Roku, attached to the same TV and the same wifi connection.Conclusion: Fire Stick works great - if you ONLY want to watch Amazon. Featuring Netflix in the Fire Stick advertising and UI is misleading and false.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Deirdre Straughan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing and love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gabriela N Wardell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am finally about to figure out how to use it and I love it-My daughter go it for me for christmas and it has been a wonderful gift!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nana"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's awesome!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alexandra Fleites"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have been very happy with the fire stick.
