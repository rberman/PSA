[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have a regular one for my mom, and in comparison, it is slower than full size model. But, it does do the job. Note - If you have a wall mount TV, think about the distance this will stick out. I had to get 90 degree angle HDMI adapters. I would give it 5 stars if it wasnt laggy/not as responsive as normal model.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mikeblahblah"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Have had several issues using 3500R.

I mainly use the Roku stick for watching Netflix and Hulu. every five seconds it has to buffer, and that's if i'm lucky and it doesn't freeze at 25%. I got rid of my chromecast and apple tv for this and it's absolute crap. I love the software, so I am returning this and will try the Roku 2 or 3.
