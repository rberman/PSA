Amazon Fire TV Stick is my new favorite.Yet again, Amazon has surpassed my expectations, and placed a smile on my face. The FIRE TV STICK is an excellent product. Allows me to customize my experience, and at a price you could never beat. Interaction and loading speeds are great, although some people say FIRE TV itself is much faster. My only suggestion is that Amazon clean up the interface a little bit better. It sometimes seems cluttered or disorganized. Otherwise, if you are even thinking about this product, DON'T HESITATE.Thank you yet again Amazon for completely surprising me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "C.
