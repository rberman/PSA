[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I'm very disappointed, most of the movies, an TV shows you have to rent. Movies like Them, creature from the Black Lagoon, Kolchak. I have all these on DVD but they r just an example. I have Netflix, an tho it costs 7.99 or so a month, u rent to movies on the fire an its about the same, anyway bottom line is to many movies an TV shows, you must rent so, I give you a negative review.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael Parris"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent unbelievable", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "evkarsojo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great.
