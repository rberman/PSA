Using it on a tv that I do not have cable for so I can just watch the movies from Amazon.For the original tv I wanted to use it on, I bought the box from Sony that allows you to connect to Am Prime movies as Netflix, etc.The selection on Amazon for Prime movies is not as extensive as I was hoping for and most of the good movies are still ones you need to pay for, but otherwise the picture is great, no delays or buffering which is also great when you are short on patience.
