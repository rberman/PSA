Took me a bit to download the apps I wanted but am glad I purchased this. The movies included through amazon prime aren't as up to date as Netflix but the Fire Stick has SOOOO many channels I've never seen before.

I only rate it low because it periodically drops the wifi connection. After it does this you have to reset it and reconnect. Many others have same problem.

A menu-based system on your tv is also helpful when trying to watch things like netflix, hulu plus, etc. Appstore for Fire TV seems to be continually growing, with an already extensive list of applications (and some games too!). Very easy to use and very functional. I use this daily!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rob"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "A little slow, but that's compared to an AppleTV.
