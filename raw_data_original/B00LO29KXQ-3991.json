Half the time there is nothing good on tv or I want to watch something that's not on, enter the fire stick. I have prime and netflix on my account. I have found that usually when I can't find something on netflix prime has it, and if it costs on prime netflix has it.

It is fast and very responsive the only down side is the menus are a little unorganized and they hard to read from across the room. All in all it's a great product that just needs some refinement.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott Barrett"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great addition to tv viewing. Fire TV Stick is a wonderful alternative to expensive satellite and cable packages that lock you in at their mercy for 2 year commitments. Countless movies and tv shows to watch and thousands of songs to add to a listening library. This also puts all of your pictures in the cloud at your fingertips for easy viewing on your tv. Only give it four stars because I feel the user interface is a bit cluttered and can be confusing for those less accustomed to today's technology. Other than that, it is a great buy and I would highly recommend it, especially if you are a prime member.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Worked fine at first, but began to experience streaming interruptions every few minutes.
