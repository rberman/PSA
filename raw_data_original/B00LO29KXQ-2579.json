Streams Netflix, Amazon Prime and more!  So easy to set up.  A lot of people are complaining that it needs to be plugged into a power source to work, and while it's true, I don't think that's a huge issue.  I have power strips near every TV in my house since the TVs, blue-ray players, and cable boxes all have to be plugged in anyways.

Customer service advised \"It's not currently possible to pay for digital orders with a credit or debit card when there are promotional or gift card funds available in your account. I\u2019m sorry for any inconvenience this causes. \"When I called to speak with a customer service rep - after my email was answered promptly - I was told the same thing : they can't do it my way, they have to do it their way.  The customer service person took a long time to decide they could refund on the gift card; when he couldn't make it work to use my debit card, he decided maybe he could 'comp' me this one time.  But then he didn't.I waited too long to return the Fire Stick, which was entirely my error.
