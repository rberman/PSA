The best thing, it came per-progammed and I didn't have to do anything with it ... it just worked.

Everytime I want to connect with it I have to search and search and search for it then when It finds it I have to try and connect several times. I have a strong fast wifi signal so I don't know what the deal is the thing I've found is that if I search with my phone and tablet at the same time I find it right away but connecting is still hard. I have the Google Chrome and have had no trouble with it at all. One more thing I like all out chrome better is that you can look around for your next show while your watching something and on fire stick you have to wait until your done with your show then hit the home button and shop around.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "unionyagow"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My husband and I easily hooked up this with the simple instructions.

Don't misunderstand though, it's just a vehicle for video and music\u2026you have to pay for access (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, etc.). Make sure you have two hdmi inputs too, otherwise you will have to switch back and forth between the stick and your cable. My biggest gripe is that the tiny remote is really difficult to control. I can tell they were trying to keep it simple, but there are too few buttons to make all of the commands. And it's so small (are we putting it in our pockets for any reason?) that it's really difficult to control (and easy to lose!). I'll ask it to move one space to the left or right and it'll jump 5 or 6. Lot's of starting over on search when it screws up your letter commands. I've had it a week and a couple of times have just given up. If you have a Netflix subscription, do your searches on your computer. They make it super easy for Amazon video though (surprise!). BUT- improve the remote, and make searching easier and I can see how it'd make me cancel my cable subscription.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark R.
