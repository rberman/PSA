[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a simple to install and operate system. For what it avails in just the basic unit you procure from Amazon is rather unbelievable. What you get is an overload of video. (Oh yah, you need to be prime to take advantage of all the free stuff) there is a bounty of many other free and for minimal cost apps that are compatible with this stick. We're using it with an AT&T; uverse router which provides lightning fast response. The fire TV stick is fantastic addition to make your video system many additional expansion for a few bucks", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Greg K \"GPK\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It has, so far, been a great product.

The demo for the Fire Stick looked great, and its setup and interface looked easy to use.  Then, the reality of the situation occurred when I tried to use the Fire Stick.I have only been able to get it to work for about 4-5 days at any given time.  At first, it worked fine.  Then, after a couple days, any time I attempt to stream anything from Amazon, I get noting but a blue screen that says: \"HDCP unauthorised.  Content disabled.\"  I can hear the program in the background, but there is no picture.  Needless to say, this is pretty frustrating and useless.I have called Amazon support.  They had me reset everything you can think of, and it started working again.  However, this only last about 2-3 days.  Then, back to the blue screen of death (sorry Microsoft).  I was informed that it might be related to other HDMI devices plugged into the TV.  The strange thing is that none of my other devices (Chromecast, Apple TV, Blueray player) have any issues at all.  It is only the Amazon Fire stick that does not appear to want to work.I am pretty disappointed.  This looked like a great device that would let me stream most of my content through one device -- since it is compatible with Netflix, Hulu, etc.  However, the inability to play Amazon's own content correctly really kills this device.  I had higher hopes for Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Nomadic Dan"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I purchased this for my downstairs family room after I had already spent the money on the Fire TV for upstairs. It works great, the only drawback that I have found as it doesn't have a processor or memory on it like the Fire TV it can not install and play some of the games that I have installed on my Fire TV. It was the main reason I bought it was to keep my kids off the upstairs TV and downstairs. But it works perfectly for what it was designed for.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "K.
