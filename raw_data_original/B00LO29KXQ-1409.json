My kids like the kids shows that Amazon prime have put out.I took away a star because every once and a while I have had to disconnect the power and reboot it.It seems to work better when connected to my router at 5 ghz than 2.4 ghz.It feels a bit cluttered with apps but it does do it's best with a simple menu. I wish there was a good filtering system for what to display; I wish it had a better front end display and organization. It would be great if different users could be implemented as an option to switch between. For example, a user for children to filter out all the adult shows available.I do have a smart TV and a Chromecast and a Netflix account. Chromecast is great too but I seem to favor the quick accesses of a remote that the fire stick has. However, Netflix runs better and looks better when using Chromecast or my smart TV. It seems to differ also with the TV. For some reason on my 2011 Samsung TV I have to turn off the HDMI Black levels because it's too bright washing out the blacks. It looks great when adjusting the TV levels. But when plugged in our Element TV it looks fine without any adjustments. The fire stick is really the best for Amazon Prime shows.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"Technic\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the accessibility to various movies and music .
