I wanted something for my bedroom TV,  I have Apple TV and wanted something different. It was on back order so it arrived late but I'm patient so that was okay.

I've reset the network connection, unplugged it, disconnected it, still won't connect!  All my other devices are connecting fine so it's not my network.

However very restricted unless you get apps that are unethical to use. I have the kindle fire hdx7 as well, same thing there. Terrible user interface except for shopping.

Until I use it for a longer period of time, I will be open minded, I would not buy Kindle products again though, I would definitely stick with ANDROID BASED (my opinion only)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "TW"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am totality pleased with my new Amazon Firestick!!!!
