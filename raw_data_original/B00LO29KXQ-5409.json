I am ready to cut the cord!  Only thing I do not like is that if we are supposed to be getting a free month of Amazon Prime WHY do we have to pay for HD on certain episodes?  I probably will not renew the Prime because of this and the fact the selection does not seem very big.The rest is fantastic.

The fact the audio goes away when watching my prime videos. I have to restart the stick.2. All the amazon videos don't always load fully.
