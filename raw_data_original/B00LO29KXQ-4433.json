So I expected Fire Stick to work the same as Chromecast. The stick installed much easier than Chromecast and functions well with the internet and my desktop.I also used real player cloud to cast all my desktop files, photos, videos, music, etc. The Stick needs to use Amazon cloud drive so any file used by the Stick has to be in the cloud drive..
