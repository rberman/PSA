I have the Amazon Fire TV (bigger version) - the microphone on that unit is great and a killer feature, but if you can get this for under $40 picking this one up is really a no brainer.  I don't game so I'm not sure if it chokes on games, everything else is zippy on the Fire TV Stick.  The initial setup sort of stunk though, you plug it in and it has to do some sort of update, it took forever and I wasn't sure if the update was working.  I walked away and came back an hour later and it completed doing the update.  I'm not going to remove a star for a hour long update, just prepare yourself if you run into the same issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "zbooks"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have a Fire TV system and the stick does it all without the box!

There is a message that appears that it is unable to download- we spent over an hour on the phone Saturday trying to troubleshoot the problem and we were told it was because our television was too old but my son took it back to college and tried on a newer television and it still does not work.  I am returning it for my money back.  Very disappointed because it seemed like it would be great and better than the chromecast we bought last year.
