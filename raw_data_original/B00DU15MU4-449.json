You are trained by the cable and dish companies to watch TV a certain way and this changes it a lot, I will probably get rid of my cable all together.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Debra"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was disappointed that there are so many movies/TV shows that we have to pay for and are not included with our Amazon prime!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Babycheetah"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "this amazon fire tv is just absolutely marvelous.  i know that i effusive but it i true.  i have yet to discover the thousands of tv and movies but have found some of what i want...so i will keep on searching.  despite other reviews i have seen on here--i found the options on lefthand side of screen where i could choose what is available on prime tv.  i thought all rentals on prime tv were free and included but have discovered they are not....that was a disappointment for sure but my fault for not reading \"small\" print.  I did not catch that i could only access and display photos if using amazon fire tablets.  is this accurate?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I wish amazon prime was a bit more affordable, I think 75.00 a year is a better rate for the service.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Fiona Harris"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "One HUGE drawback as far as I'm concerned:  When you do a search and you choose \"All viewing options,\" it doesn't give you items that are free to watch on Netflix.  I guess because of the competition, but it is a little annoying.  I have to go to Netflix\u200b and then search for it that way.  Otherwise, it is pretty cool to just speak in what you're looking for.

Thought it was a bit weird to have an intro video about how to use the product at first launch, but wasn't annoying. Only complaint is the iOS app doesn't allow pasting of passwords.
