We had Roku and were satisfied with that until we experienced Kindle Fire TV. My sister has Apple TV but when she experienced Kindle Fire TV she thought it outperformed Apple. So much easier to search options and having my Amazon Prime account integrated is awesome.

I found one thing that I don't like and for this reason alone I will be returning the product to the store.  Why did you lock out Netflix on the speech Search. The main feature that I bought the box for does not include searching Netflix.I pay for a Prime Account and a Netflix streaming account.  When you unlock your search to include Netflix I will buy this product again.  I know a lot of people that have both a Prime Membership and a Netflix streaming account.  They all agree both should be included in the speech search feature.Please let me know when this has fixed because (I certainly feel it is broken)Sincerely,Ron in NC", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Ronald H."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you have this and Amazon Prime, you can watch dozens of shows. Downton Abby, Orphan Black, The Americans- all not on Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Denise Holt"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The interface is really clean and modern. It is generally fast and quick to buffer media. The hardware is attractive and unobtrusive.The issues lie with Amazon Prime streaming. Sometimes, there is a small lag between when you click on the show and all of the episodes are available to watch. I expect hardware of this quality to immediately display all information and graphics after downloading. Sometimes the episode icon is hidden in the season list and you only see text when clicking through. The biggest issue is that often video playback cuts out and an internet connection error pops up. This is very frustrating, especially since the internet doesn't go out on the network I use, making it an unexpected error. I have to exit to the home screen and go back to the show before the watch option will come back up for the episode. This is annoying since I cannot simply press back and get taken back to the option to play the same episode. It really gets on my nerves when I'm eating something greasy and planned on not touching the remote for the duration of the show.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Matthew Adsit"}]
