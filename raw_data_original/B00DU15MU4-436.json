I gave it 5 stars because it does do what it promises to do.  We cut the cord to pay TV, so it is nice to still be able to access movies, recorded shows and music from the TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Zusiqu \"zusiqu\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My best choice since I gave up cable.  If you don't have cable at all, it's still limited, but I hope to see changes and improvements in content available.  The growing group of cable dumpers should make this a growing genre for tv addicts like myself.
