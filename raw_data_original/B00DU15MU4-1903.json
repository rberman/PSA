I am just an ordinary woman out here who wanted a Fire TV. I am simply amazed at this technology. To able to speak into a remote and have it bring up the movie on my screen is awesome. I love this item. It has beautiful screen savers and other features that are remarkable as well. The set up is so simple even I could do it. I am really enjoying this item so much I can't recommend it enough. I know this is a very plain and simple review but some of this really technological information is just too much for me. But if you want just a simple review this is it. I say buy it for the price, if you have Prime Membership, it is well worth the money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "redsilk46"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Day one, there was some hiccups trying to figure out how to get my music on the device. But once that was figured out I couldn't be anything but happier. I am so happy with this device and service. Amazon does it again!!! The one huge selling point is that I can hardwired the device directly to my router. No searching for wifi or long buffering time, like with my previous Roku device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "N.

I had been blaming my internet provider.  it is not also faster but now netflix has the movies divided up into more categories. no constant rebuffering.  I can pause without worrying about losing it completely.  it cost twice as much but well worth it.
