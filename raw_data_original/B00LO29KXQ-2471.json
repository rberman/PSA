The fire stick consistently needs to buffer to watch Netflix. Our Internet speeds are 50 mbps down and 5 mbps up. The only reason we got the fire stick is because there is no Sling TV app for chromecast yet. Will be nice to be able to rent Amazon movies since we are prime customers however wish they just made a chromecast app as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dbrand"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.

I bought this for my bedroom. I don't have cable or satellite. Just Hulu and Netflix. What sold me was that it came with a remote. So I am not constantly having to use my phone(con for me. Maybe a pro for others?) The 1 beef I have with the remote is that I cannot control my tv's volume or on/off. My Xbox remote can do it in my living room.
