Netflix and Hulu have it figured out so Amazon could do the same.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/7", "author": "Jeff G"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "John (my husband) loves to watch movies and he had watchedso many of the movies several times..not a real good selectionon the package we had.

The responsivness is excellent as is the voice command.  I am however disappointed with the bait and switch on programming. I chose Amazon Prime because of the  benifits and decided the extra cost was acceptable. I was recently informed of a price increase for the membership and decided that also was accpetable. What I find unaccepable is a season or two of a series that is free with Prime membership and an additional charge to to be able to finish the series. I do hope Amazon reconsiders this practice. Other than that, I have been completely satisfied with Prime which has resulted in Amazon being my first choice for all my on-line purchases.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Donnie Moore"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Much easier to use to get to watch a show on TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
