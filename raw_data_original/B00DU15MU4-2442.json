I also have an Apple TV which was very difficult to get into service through iTunes.  However, after some weeks of experiencing both, maybe the Apple product has the edge.  We prefer the layout of the options on the screen.  The speak function on the Amazon product is far from foolproof.  Ok, it is tedious to have to input titles into Apple but it is a lot surer and quicker than the voice option on the other device.  Still and all, for the $100 you cannot go wrong for the money and the amazing entertainment both provide.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "fish 0143"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far so good.
