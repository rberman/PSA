I originally bought it for $20 on pre-sale. That ones remote stopped working, so they sent me a new unit. This ones remote works but the screen is constantly freezing, and then the screen plays really fast. Other times the sound will go out. I do not have these problems playing Amazon from the TV app, or the Wii, so I am certain the issue is with the stick itself.Save your time and money and buy a different product, of a better quality.
