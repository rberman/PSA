I love that after you set it up on any TV you can just plug it into any other TV in your house and it works.  I have it with a trial Netflix account and have been using it a lot for that.  I am not sure if I will use it as much when it runs out.  Works great.  We love it and the kids love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "erinrae23"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like it a lot", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "angela hardin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great option for watching Prime videos or using other souces of streaming content, like music or SlingTV.

Unfortunately i found that out later. I wanted netflix and amazon instant videos in my bedroom and the ability to mirror my surface to it. It does not mirror windows tablets or pcs to it. They have caught some bad feedback on this and changed the way the listing appears now. It came out with half-baked software that ran like s***. took me 3 days to complete the first update. Updates now are much faster but will almost always fail the first attempt.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ryan Giles"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Not enough movies included under the Prime membership.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Julia M.
