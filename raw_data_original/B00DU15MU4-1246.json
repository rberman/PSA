I have a set top box from Verizon Fios and I didn't know how to set it up.  I read somewhere that I had to change the HDMI to the one where I plugged in the Amazon Fire.  Well, once I did that, it worked perfectly (DUH).  I absolutely love it.  You can't go wrong with this.  I already had access to Netflix, HBO, and SHO so I didn't have to subscribe to them.
