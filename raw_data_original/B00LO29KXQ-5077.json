[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I use this thing all the time and the integration with android is a lifesaver because I never know where the remote is...but I never need it. I use this item everyday.

We have a TV which is not Wi-Fi ready & we didn't want to spend the money for an additional satellite receiver. The fire stick allows me to connect to our home Wi-Fi and watch movies & TV shows with our Amazon Prime and Netflix subscriptions.  Thanks Amazon!!  I really like the new look of the menus.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Kelemental \"Kelly Carlton\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.

We  use it at home in the living rooms and it's super zippy compared to the Roku. Since it's so portable we're able to take it into my son's room where we places a small tv and can use it there as well.  When we go to grandmas we also take it.  I'm thinking of buying one for there house now but it's so small it's super easy to transport back and forth.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JassoFamily \"Damon Jasso\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have the full size Fire TV and was excited to see the Stick released and of course the price.Compared to the Fire TV it does almost everything, of course the Fire TV is faster and the remote with that includes voice commands (need to use the App or buy the upgraded remote on the Stick)  Otherwise its a great device.In addition to the Fire TV and Stick I also have a Chromecast, older Roku, Roku 3 (latest) and I use internet TV (and antenna) exclusively.  The Fire TV and Stick are my go to devices, effectively retiring the Chromecast and Roku.Why?  Well I am a big Prime user, so that is huge, but I also use Hulu and Netflix, but in the end, the Fire TV devices are just easier to use.  The lack of remote on the Chromecast is frustrating and I am a huge smartphone user and it still feels unnatural and annoying.  As for the Roku, the interface is dated and the apps seem isolated compared to the integration in the Fire TV.For the price you can't beat the Fire TV stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike"}]
