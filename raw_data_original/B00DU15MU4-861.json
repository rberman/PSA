I have no idea what I want to watch regularly and to just watch something takes too many steps to get to something.  The shows I want to watch are not available unless through another service (Hulu, Sling, etc.)  But even then could get sling to work, continues to tell me network connection issues, though everything else works fine. I have not found this to be a good option to change from cable/satellite.  I can not stream from the internet or from my computer.
