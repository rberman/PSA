Access to my prime account and watchlist was seamless and I didn't need to add any additional login details.  I do like the phone app.  It takes away the need to by another remote for voice recognition and you can use the phone's keyboard to type as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian Waddell"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I already own a chromecast, a roku, a wii and a smart TV. I was excited because this had mentioned it would be faster than the rest and the price point was right.Unfortunately, the interface is very difficult to use and aimed at guiding you to amazon products. It has no screenshare function either, I still use my Roku 3.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.

I love that it was inexpensive and is small, but it constantly drops the connection. There are times when a show i am watching on Netflix simply abruptly drops to a static gray screen. Unplugging the device from the TV for several minutes seemed to fix that problem, but, like many people describe, about an hour into another show, my signal drops. My Fire Stick is about 24 inches away from my wifi router. I'm really frustrated with this thing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Steph Mom \"Steph\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works quite well", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "johnsona698"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "You get more for your dollar as far as sticks are concerned. Compared to a Roku 3 the fire stick could be placed in a trash bin. The Roku 3 costs $80 double the cost of the fire stick, but you get more than double the benefits.Cons: The fire stick is always on even when sleeping. There are no themes just some very old school screensaver options. The remote feels cheap.Too much Amazon, Amazon prime paid subscription and advertisements play before I can watch. You have to search app after app to see where is the best place to watch your video,unlike Roku's awesome one search feature. The remote does not double as a game controller like a Roku 3. Amazon affiliated services in apps, there is no VUDU or UV. Most games require game controller (sold separately), The Roku 3's remote doubles as a game controller.Pros: It is cheap. It can turn your regular television into a SMART television with less options.Verdict: The amazon fire service as a whole simply is not up to par with the Roku service. You simply can not fall in love with Amazon fire,  like you can with a Roku. If you try a Roku 3 you will see how far amazon is from the competition not even competing at the same level. I will keep it since its here but I regret purchasing it.Happy reviewing beware of the fake reviews on amazon. I recommend you check out a roku 3 before investing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Applesauce"}]
