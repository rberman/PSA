Netflix works more or less if you don't mind waiting while it buffers or hangs up. Hulu I have given up on and watch online.  I never have these problems using the computer.

I adore Amazon, so I thought I couldn't go wrong with the Fire TV Stick. I've never had issues with any other Amazon product, but this stick does not live up to my expectations for several reasons.Firstly, I want to say what I like about it. I think it's got a lot of potential. I love the menu. I like that it's small and easy to bring everywhere with you and that it also has a remote. It's got apps and tons of games. It seems to be extremely versatile.The bad things:The remote: The left and right buttons stick constantly. I'll be scrolling through things and next thing I know I'm 20 apps/channels/shows away from where I started and there's no stopping it once it gets going. This happened right out of the box, and nothing has been spilt on this remote. Repeated use has not broken it in, either.The wifi: I've got a 1200sq house with wifi routers on both ends. The room I'm using this in is right in the middle, but the spot is maybe 10feet or so closer to the router on one side of the house. It doesn't matter which I connect it to. Sometimes it drops signal alltogether. Sometimes it sees one, and not the other. Sometimes it sees the other and not the first one. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. And even with two wifi routers on both sides of my relatively small house, I can't seem to use this for the room it was bought for.When the wifi does work: Streaming is still interrupted. Loading times are just insane. If I put my chromecast or my roku box in the same spot, neither of them have issues like this. Another thing to note is neither of those products have /any/ problems streaming /or/ connecting to the wifi.Certain apps have way more issues than other ones. For instance, the Hulu Plus app with black out but continue playing sound. Sometimes it'll even have the logo for the show in the bottom, but there is no other video? This happens for several minutes at a time before correcting itself. This doesn't happen on the roku or the chromecast, so I'm not sure what the problem could be.Overall, I'm pretty dissapointed and I really wanted to love this thing. Maybe in time they'll iron out the bugs but I'm not entirely sure I'd buy another ever again. =(", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ashley R Carey"}]
