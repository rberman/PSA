I really had high hopes for the Fire Stick and wanted to love it before it even arrived. Compared to the Roku, I like it, but I'm not sure that I love it yet. It doesn't have the voice remote included and the app that is supposed to let you speak to the Fire Stick doesn't work properly. The app selection is more limited than the Roku. We frequently use Vudu and that's not even available on the Fire Stick. That said, there is a decent selection of apps, however, the ones I downloaded - A&E; and History channel both only had clips of shows, no actual full episodes were available to watch. I was kind of disappointed with that, but for a $25 streaming device, it is serving its purpose. We subscribe to only subscribe to Prime, so I guess we will be limited to just watching that. Conclusion: I'm not sure I'd buy another one, and I definitely don't think it is worth full price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dj121"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!Great device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JBouts \"JBouts\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Has some connectivity issues at times.
