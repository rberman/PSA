[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is an awesome product for those that have subscriptions to entertainment services like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu. I can take it with me to different TVs in my house and even traveling. It's great for use in my camper as well (when we stay at RV parks with wi-fi). It has way more apps than I expected, including music and games. I love the option of using my phone as the remote. Definitely worth the purchase!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amber Anderson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My son loves it. .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christian Rivera"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lynda"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Have been enjoying the movies and catching up with missed TV series", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angela Lang"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Outstanding", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Maine"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Laurie.
