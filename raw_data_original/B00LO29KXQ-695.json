The first two didn't stream Amazon and the Blu-Ray player was slow and always buffering. My kid mentioned the Fire Stick, so I tried it out and absolutely love this thing. So far, no issues with buffering and load times are pretty quick. Only thing I wished is the ability to use Bluetooth headphones (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars). I would highly recommend this for people looking at streaming players to hook up to their TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bui"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I'm enjoying this purchase with one exception.  The audio is unpredicable and I'm uncertain if it's a TV issue or a Fire Stick issue.  I have to turn the volume to nearly the highest level to hear conversations.  If/when there are sound effects the volume changes and is blasting loud.  I'm not pleased about having to watch a movie with my remote in my hand to constantly adjust volume.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MKG97 \"Marcia\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Interface seems a little sluggish, but it works and has support for all the major things a chromecast can do.
