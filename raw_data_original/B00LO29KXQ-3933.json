It has gotten a little better with the updates, but still there way too often.

I'd imagine they share essentially the same pool of apps. With the amazon app marketplace already limited filtered with it's modified android os, mojito, with this additional layer of filter makes the apps available for Fire TV Stick very limited. Probably even less than Windows marketplace! For example, I can watch Crunchyroll on my HDX (yay anime! premium user here btw!) but can't seem to download the app for the TV Stick.Plus there is no search function for apps, so you have to manually select categories and sift through each, and, every, single, app within that category.It's unusually difficult to put the TV stick to sleep, and I mean sleep, not turn off. You have to scroll all the way down to the settings, then pan all the way to the right to reach further settings options to put the device to sleep, otherwise you will have to wait about 15-20 minutes for it time-out in screen saver mode. I suppose this can be a positive since being asleep makes it boot significantly faster, but personally I like to be environmentally mindful and have the option to just completely turn off the device. So I find myself flipping the switch of the surge protector that the TV Stick is connected to occasionally.Sometimes the TV Stick will randomly drop connections. I have to manually reboot the device to rediscover the WIFI signal and successfully connect again. Can be annoying.I don't know if it's just me, but sometimes while using the remote, I find myself having a hard time gripping the remote and it sometimes slips or falls out of my hand!The Verdict:the device has a lot of potential and provides great ease of access to amazon content as well as a limited other streaming services, however it isn't nearly as robust in it's market place versus the competition though that may very much change in the foreseeable future. There still seems to be some bugs and certainly not everything has been optimized, but overall, the experience has mostly been enjoyable for an incredible value.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "2woYoung"}]
