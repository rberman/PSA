I ended up pulling the Fire Stick from the HDMI, I watched couple movies and the look really good. I would like to see Amazon Prime to have more selection on movies just like Netflix because if you have to pay for every movie even old movies. I think it's not what I expected, but the Stick so far works find, add more tutorials regarding this matter. I could give a 4 star if he wasn't for the problem on how to put it to sleep.
