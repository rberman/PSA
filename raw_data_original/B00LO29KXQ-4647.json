[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I only really need this device for the plex app integration and frankly its horrible. The poor streaming quality is a deal breaker. It may be plex's fault, but I have no issues with plex anywhere else except for the fire stick.

I have to say that I'm new to streaming movies on the internet. The Fire Stick was very easy to set up and navigate.  The Fire Stick has so much to choose from; from movies to TV series to you tube videos, and numerous other apps.
