We've actually had to move our router to accommodate this.  2) You need a separate power source - I thought it'd use the power from the tv - I hate having more cords around.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "nabs"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This product is awful!  I bought 2 of them by the CLAIM that it was fast and no buffering.  It CONSTANTLY BUFFERS and FREEZES!!!  My previous Roku worked 10x better than this product.  I am so disappointed.  I like the appearance of the menus and the voice commands.  But the overall useage I would give 1/2 a star to.  I can barely use it cause it ALWAYS BUFFERS OR FREEZES.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "RACHEL L. ANDERSON"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For $19, this is a bargain.  I like the fact that it disappears from view, and am surprised by how much free content there is on Amazon Prime.  If you don't have Prime, this is a worthless product.
