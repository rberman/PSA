I needed one for my family room TV but didn't care if it had the more advanced remote. It was so easy to configure when it arrived and found my wireless network on the second attempt to connect. The picture quality seems to be just as good as my other Fire TV larger box and am very happy with the $39 price. I was on the waiting list for the Prime Day Anniversary for this item, but finally bit the bullet and paid the full price.
