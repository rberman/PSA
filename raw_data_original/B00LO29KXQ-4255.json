Got the stick for my bedroom since it's such a great price.  The only difference in it from the regular fire TV is it doesn't have the voice requesting, you have to type it in.  Other than that, it's exactly the same!!  So if you don't care about \"talking\" to it, get this one, it's the much better bargain!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Annette Story \"Annetteref\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice streaming device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patrick G"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Bought this for my brother and sister in law.
