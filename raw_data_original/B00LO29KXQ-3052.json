[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "It's a great little device that has a lot of different functionality. The user interface is a bit quirky though, and it's very irritating that it doesn't support 802.11ac/5GHz networks that would be able to supply better streaming quality.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nicholas Medica"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "After finally finding somebody who could open the remote.

We popped it in and now guests have an option for tv viewing without us having to get an extra tv box for the occasional visitor.  It is easy to use and works great.  You just pop it in the back of the tv and it works on the wifi.  We have netflix and amazon prime so there is plenty to watch.  It would also be great for a room where you don't have a smart tv.  It is much less expensive than replacing the tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Judy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was a gift from our daughters.
