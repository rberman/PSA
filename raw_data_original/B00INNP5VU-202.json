The remote is a little sluggish to respond.Make sure you look at how long it is before you buy it!  It's pretty long.  I bough it for my bedroom TV and it just barely fits between the TV and the wall, and it wouldn't fit into my living room TV at all.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "ZachG"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very user friendly easy to install and great streaming", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lawrence kelley"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works as expected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Inky"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works perfectly, I already had a Roku 2 in my room.

Access to Netflix and Amazon Instant Prime is a given, but it also has a huge selection of other free channels I watch regularly like German News (Tageschau), various yoga classes, knitting classes (SheruKnitting) and public access channels.  Was previously streaming via my Panasonic Blu-Ray player - but this is much better!  Still using my Panasonic on my older 20\" tube TV since the input is not compatible with Roku.
