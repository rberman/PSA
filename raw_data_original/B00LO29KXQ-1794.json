The only reason for the 4 vs 5 star is that it does not have several sports-related apps that I use on my Android phone.  I would love to see Amazon add far more sports apps.  Otherwise, TV, Movies, Music, etc. are all 5 star.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"rolsen13\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Worked great right away.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product.

Recently I started having a buffering problem when watching Amazon Instant Video. I tried replacing my Roku2 device with a Roku Stick, but the problem continued. I decided to give the Fire Stick a try and it has been working fine for Amazon content, with no buffering issues. Overall  I still prefer the Roku2 and continue to watch Netflix, HBO Go and MLBTV because the Roku2 does a better job, but for streaming Amazon content the Fire Stick solved my problem. An additional benefit for Prime members is being able to play your Prime Music library which you cannot do on any Roku device. So for Amazon content it's very good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rock"}]
