I chose it mainly because I have Amazon Prime and also Netflix. We have several HD tv's in the house and only one smart TV and this makes them all a smart tv. Like the simplicity of moving the fire stick to any of the TV's. Have not had it long enough to take on a trip. It was a tight fit on the back of the TV's but once you get the hang of it, it is ok. Menu navigation could be improved but over all I give it a 5 star rating, price is good and goes great with Amazon Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Update:  After battling the firestick for months trying to figure out what was wrong we've finally solved our problem. It was our 5 year TV that wasn't getting along with it.  I hooked it up to our computer monitor and it worked perfectly.  I'm not sure why the TV would effect the internet connection of the firestick, but whatever.  Make sure your TV is compatible!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert Ryder"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing works awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "scot hansen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Gary Busey was right!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "justin brassell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very user friendly and easy to set up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joseph R.
