This is basically a glorified re-streaming box. In order to get any real usability you have to have another Apple device that supports air play. Almost all the apps that come on it need to be \"hidden\" as you cannot uninstall them to free up memory. You cannot download and install new apps. Some of the apps don't work at all. The first app in the list is Netflix and we have been unable to set it up becaue it keeps saying that Netflix is unavailable. In order to use something like Amazon Video you have to stream it from another Apple device so that makes it useless. Spend the few extra $$ or wait for a deal on the new Roku and get that instead!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "James"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "WONDERFUL!
