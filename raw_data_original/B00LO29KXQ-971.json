This Fire TV Stick is great! The on screen screen setup instructions were easy to understand, although it's easy enough to setup without them. It's more responsive than the Roku. The UI only took me a day or two to get accustomed to as well. Great product! I'll be purchasing more to swap out my remaining Roku boxes!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Not really sure why I waited to purchase the Fire TV Stick, and I had high expectations of this product so for it to exceed those expectations is unexpected.  Usually I wait a few months to make a review as a few days or weeks isn't enough time to test out a purchase, however in this case I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and expect you will be too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's a great product idea,but it freezes it heats up and it won't even work at all at times.

It operates smoothly and quickly; very slick.  And there is so much free content available with amazon prime.
