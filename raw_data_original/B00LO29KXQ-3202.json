[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is great and amazing technology.  Shows load fast, play in great quality, and the interface is easy to use.  I never could have expected this kind of performance out of a package as small and inexpensive as this thing.On the downside, occasionally the streaming video does a sort of \"hiccup.\"  It's barely what I would call lag, but noticeable and frequent enough to be somewhat annoying.  I'm not sure if it is the Fire TV Stick or my internet, so this might not be fair.  I HAVE noticed though that the frequency of these \"hiccups\" has decreased over the time I've used the Stick.Further, I wish the remote had more features.  I don't care about voice search, I'm talking about menu and setting options right on the remote.  It's certainly a simple and streamlined remote, but perhaps overly so.I grew up in the pre-internet days of the first personal computers.  Telephones were attached to the wall with a cord in my childhood.  This technology strikes me as something out of the Jetsons.

As stated by many others setup is easy and simple control buttons are uncomplicated. Movie streaming has been flawless. Only improvement I'd like to see is the watch list. If I could categorize my list it would be easier to find movies in my list. Haven't try music or games. On another note it'easy to switch over my uverse from hdmi 1 to hdmi2 to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "francesro"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great alternative. The Fire Stick is pretty cool, offers a lot of TV shows and movies.  It would be great if it had a larger selection of current movies.. but can't complain for not having a monthly fee.

Worst purchase I have ever made. Just does not work. I have a strong wifi signal and my wifi works for all other streaming devices in my home. The Fire TV Stick just keeps freezing. I reboot reset and still has same issue. This is just an under powered device. I am glad I only spent $19. No wonder the fire phone was DOA if this the best Amazon can do. I have an Echo on order. If it is as bad as this it will go back.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "brieck"}]
