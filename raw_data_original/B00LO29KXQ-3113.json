Everything was working great except for Netflix.  Netflix video stuttered and the audio while the audio was fine.  The Amazon Prime videos worked great the audio is ahead of the Google Chrome player. The Fire had Dolby Digital + and Chrome Dolby Digital.  The quality before March 31, 2015 was great on the Fire.  Then Amazon updated the firmware.... Audio is now in mostly PCM format, and the some of the Prime videos are playing in DD+.  I did see Amazon updated the Audio settings, and changed a few different times.  Nothing worked, my Yamaha RX-A3000 was still receiving PCM.  This firmware sucks, now my Amazon audio stinks, Netflix now works fine.  Amazon, please work on the firmware, and post the changes after you update so we know what changes happen on the screen. I also noticed there is finally a restart option.  How are we suppose to know what changes happen, and what to adjust?  Amazon keeps selling itself short. My advice is this, wait to buy the Fire until it's more robust....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kryptto"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "DO NOT BUY THIS! It's a huge waste of your time! I bought this as a gift for my husband's birthday. Of course it didn't work. I called Amazons support and all they had me do was unplug it and replug it back into the TV. Still didn't work. So they sent me a second one. The second one didn't work. Again called Amazon. They sent me a third one. Still did not work!! Then I had to spend an hour on the phone trying to get my money back. Now I have three fire sticks that I have to drive to UPS to mail them back. Such a waste of time!! The product isn't made very well and feels cheap. Think twice before buying this. Don't make the same mistake I did.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Megan Grant"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Update 5-28-15 Just found out my Sony Bravia factory TV remote controls this thing!!!! Found out by accident, but it works I was so happy now I don't need that little remote that always gets lost. I didn't program it or anything. Another thing that has been happening for about a month regardless of what remote I use is that Netflix launches and everything seems fine and you can click on everything, its just when you actually try playing a episode or movie it loads about 5% than says error. So, I have to go back to the fire tv main screen and load Netflix from the apps section instead of the recently viewed or whatever it is. VERY ANNOYING!!!!! Otherwise I still like it.4-1-2015Still cheaper than any wifi blu ray player I have found, which is basically the alternative. Chrome cast doesn't have a remote which is a deal breaker for me. It serves the intended purpose I bought it for, which is steaming Netflix in the bedroom. In that respect it seems to work well with no obvious flaws. What I do not like is that all the extra things on it are basically there to try and get you to purchase prime, and honestly I wasn't seeing anything on prime that grabbed my attention and that isn't already on Netflix. I did have hopes that prime would actually have newer releases or more content than Netflix, and in that case I would be interested but not with the current offerings. HBOGO seemed promising, but I will not purchase something that I already pay for in my regular cable in the living room. I wish they had a Comcast app that allowed all the channels and on demand you get with a cable box, but that's wishful thinking. If you're looking for a fairly cheap streaming device that doesn't take up really any space and works well I would recommend this. For those of you who say you eliminate the cable box by making this purchase, I would not agree at all. I am not the biggest fan of my cable provider, but after thinking about getting rid of cable and just streaming, I wouldn't do it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's alright.

It does work well for Amazon's content, but I also wanted a way to connect to my computers to stream media from them for that TV.  Plex seems to be the only choice so far but I really dislike Plex.  If Serviio ever gets working on it, I would like it much more, but not until then.  I ended up buying another Sony BD/DVD player that also streams content and that works great for the 2nd TV for everything we could want.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rippler"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I'm amazed that this stick is a mini computer.
