Once I got it set up and started trying it, every video paused every two seconds for three seconds at a time. Just to be clear HBOGO works just fine on my computer as do Netflix and Hulu. The last two also work well on every console I've tried them on.The problems go beyond mere playback though. A week later I start testing my network speed and talk to my ISP and they say that due to signal issues starting a week before they had to cap my bandwidth dropping me from a measured 1.2 - 1.3 to 0.55. I don't immediately connect the dots, but I plug in the firestick again just to be sure and the results are immediate. Even when I'm not I'm not using it the ping increases to six times normal and my download speed drops to .55Mbps.There are a number of people who've commented before about how this tends to misbehave on home networks and usually the blame is given to router. For the sake of documentation. I've tested with both a Netgear R7000 and an Apple Airport Extreme.I did have a plan B for this device involving using it to run kodi (it'd have been a step up from my raspberry pi media center), but considering its misbehavior, this device is unsuitable for anything other than sabotage.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Michael"}]
