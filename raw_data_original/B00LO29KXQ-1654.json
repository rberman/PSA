We can watch Netflix now without firing up the Xbox. The remote is very responsive, but easy to lose. I put colored tape on mine so I can find it better on my dark tables and couches.

It is easy to setup and to navigate the menus.  Wifi antenna must be good as I am pretty far from my wifi router and get very strong signal.  Netflix also works great on the stick as well.My only complaint and it's a small one is the battery cover on the back is a pain in the butt to get off, I have big hands and it's not easy for me to grip it and slide.  For $99 a year I just wish they had more free shows, but I guess the free 2 day shipping makes up for that.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MattS85"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire Stick is great alternative for watching movies and easy to hook up", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ben  A"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "For reasons of work remain between Costa Rica and the United States , the device does not serve me in Costa Rica", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Diego Cartin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Super cool!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lady Smith"}]
