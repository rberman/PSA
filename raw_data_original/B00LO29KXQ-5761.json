First off, it offers a remote BUT you can also download an app that acts as a remote as well.  This was huge as I was immediately concerned in the eventuallity of me losing said remote.I dont have any real criticsms but if there is anything ti nitpick that would be that the remote needs to be pointed at the tv.  its not RF or at least I havent verified however its not as bad as traditional IR (since the receiver stick is behind the TV.The HDMI dongle is good thinking on Amazon's team.  When there are multiple HDMI ports as mine does the stick though flush, could make thinks a little trickier to unplug.  Having said that, the dongle extension they provide does the trick with flying colors.The interface is simple but intuitive, adding apps like Hulu and youtube took less then a few minutes.  I was up and running watching shows on hulu, amazon prime and youtube (btw, if you have an android smartphone, pair it with youtube and you can \"tell\" the firestick to show what your phone is watching!!!)I have removed my cable box from my room, which charges $10/mo, subscribing to Hulu Plus is 8 bucks..So now i have instant access to all the shows that I watch and then some.  Its worth it and saving a few bucks to boot.I plan to fully cut the cable cord once the promotional cable rate is over (its bundled with my internet).Things to consider though esp in this day and age where there are data caps to our \"unlimited internet\" plans.  Comcast offers 300gb in most if not all plans.  I strongly recommend when watching youtube or netflix to use \"medium\" quality.  It greatly reduces the amount of data in your plan.  Im going on 10 days into my plan (while using Hulu literally ALL DAY and night) along with working at home (VOIP/VPN) and only used 50gb of data.  Before I was using over 120gb+ by this time!I recommend this over the chromecast only because of the remote.  I like to have a physical remote but the OPTION of a software remote is a nice touch.  Performance is good and no stuttering observed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian W"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Had to return one out of two units purchased, since it couldn't reconnect to my WiFi after it downloaded and installed firmware update.No idea why amazon did not fully implement Bluetooth functionality.

The HDMI extension cable (about 4 inches long) is a nice accessory, makes cramped port locations on the TV a non-issue. - Issue ... on startup - UI balks at the connected power supply stating I need to use the one included.  EVEN when using that one! - Issue ... the channel line up needs to be enhanced.  Partially that is my fault for choosing the FireStick over the Roku. - Issue ... the Stick doesn't just stop after the current episode.  It will play all the episodes from a given show successively.I tried to cancel the order before it shipped.  But evidently the product was probably already packed for shipment.  The device shipped later that day.For my purpose ... I think the Roku (2 or 3) would have been a better choice.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J. Dlouhy"}]
