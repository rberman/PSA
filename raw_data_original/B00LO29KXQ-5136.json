[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works great and seems to load quickly.  Watched a few Netflix programs and it never paused to buffer the program.  My only complaint is with Amazon Prime.  I understand some of it is out Amazons control but some older shows on Prime still cost money to watch but on Netflix they are free, other than your monthly fee.  I paid for a year of Prime.  Like I said its my only complaint.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bunyon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great easy to use service", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
