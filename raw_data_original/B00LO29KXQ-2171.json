It works great and we love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Leslie Keller"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Video playback for me is jittery in every app, but its most reliable while playing amazon content.  I have 50 Mbps internet, so I dont think thats the problem, and I also checked for updates.  Seems to run rather hot, I took mine apart and glued heat sinks on, but its still glitchy on playback, so im guessing heat isnt the problem.  However, the temperature may affect lifetime.  It turns on supper fast and navigation is smooth.  The HBO GO app does not run well on mine.  There was one instance I got a blue screen error code about licensing while attempting to play netflix content, but a power cycle of the TV and stick resolved the issue.  The remote works good. Overall it works pretty good and has the ability to improve with software updates, and I like it better than the apple TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "james"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Constantly locks up on me, have 3 Chromecasts and rarely see an issue.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Aaron Glaesemann"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect for Prime subscribers.

It was super easy to install - I usually have problems figuring technical stuff out but I really just had to plug this in and go. The instructions were super simple and easy-to-follow and everything I needed (Including batteries for the remote) were right in the box. I didn't need the extender because my HDMI port was easily accessible, but it's great that it comes with one. All I had to do was set up the Netflix app and enter my password. It already was connected to my Amazon account so all my videos and Prime were ready to go. It also has an app for Pandora which you can use with the non-paid version of Pandora, which I really like. It is fast and easy to use, there has been no buffering or delay. I think it's well worth the price I paid and I wish I had bought this a long time ago.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Chelsey Mullins"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am very satisfied", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Maurice R.

It's marketed as the most powerful streaming stick.  If this thing is the most powerful, and by powerful they mean the best streaming experience, then this thing fails miserably.  I've used it now for 6 months and I can't take it anymore.  I purchased this to watch Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime content.  The problem is I can't watch anything without this thing freezing up.  Netflix has to pause and buffer every 15 minutes.  Hulu Plus is the WORST.  Long buffering/loading time, and when it comes back from a commercial there's a black screen but the audio works.  I've tried exiting and getting back into Hulu, same problem.  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Hulu, no luck.  I've tried clear cache & clear data, didn't help one bit!  I've unplugged my modem and router, didn't help at all either.  I have now resorted back to accessing these streaming apps through my blu ray player and haven't had any of these issues.  The problem is not with my internet, the problem is the Fire Stick and I refuse to use it anymore.  Which is a shame as it was easy to navigate and I want to add sling TV, but since it has such problems with Netflix and Hulu, I'm not about to see what kind of headaches it brings to sling TV.  My advice, stay away from the Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Mom in Nebraska"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lowell B."}]
