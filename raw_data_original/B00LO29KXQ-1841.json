I love the remote that comes with it. I can plug it in anywhere. I love the app for my phone that duplicates as a remote. Great apps included for Netflix and Flixter and other services. I would have given another star except that sometimes the movies don't play well. That may be because of my slow Time-Warner service, not Amazon. I also own a Chromecast. I like both. It's worth it to own both.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dan Q"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert Schultz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Janet W."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good buy, better as gift.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Larry L.
