I'm not a techie nor am I going to pretend to be.My husband cut the Satellite out of our lives a few months ago so I bought a decent antenna and Fire TV.  Both were awesome purchases.The set up for this was incredibly easy, I did it on my own.  I haven't gotten to use it for myself very much because everyone else in the house monopolizes it. The kids love the Disney shows that are available via prime that they always watched before.  My husband watches a lot of things.  It's so easy my kindergartener can use it without being able to read more than 3-4 letter words yet.I want to buy a new TV for my bedroom and bother Kindle Fire TV to hook up to it. Excellent investment for us and so much better than the Google Chromecast that I loved before I bought this. I didn't know what I was missing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Heather A \"from Not Everyone's Mama\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received the Fire TV as a gift. So far it works as advertised and I enjoy getting all my videos (NETFLIX, Hulu Plus, Amazon etc) through one box. I have a smart TV and a smart DVD player but the interface on the fire TV is smoother. I was surprised to learn that it could be used to play games and that there is a game controller available. I also like the fact that I can use my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 to search Amazon for videos and when I find one that I want to watch I can watch it on my Kindle or select to start the video on the Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sailordd878 \"sailordd878\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "susan"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works as expected and like the small profile.

I can promise you that you won't be upset if you quit reading now and just click buy. This is another great product from Amazon. I love the power of this little box. Everything works with super speed just like it should. Voice search is cool if you use Amazon video a lot. I wish it worked with Netflix, HBO Go and etc but maybe in the future. The only hiccup I have ran across is Netflix not wanting to load any videos and timing out. The quick fix was to clear the data and cache in the Amazon video app from the settings and it all worked fine again. I'm not counting that against the Fire TV because I'm sure it is one of those bugs Netflix needs to update in there app to fix. Quality of video is awesome in HD or Standard. I think it is way crisper and clearer then my Roku which was replaced by the Fire TV. I now have both the Fire Stick and Fire TV and I can say they are both the best streamers I have used.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris Collett"}]
