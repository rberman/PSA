This is the same concept as the apple tv but is so much cheaper for the product AND the movies, etc. on there. Especially if youre a prime user because then you have access to a ton of different free movies, shows and music. VERY much worth the money! Got this to replace my cable :) and have not missed it once. Can put netflix on it too, so we havent used the apple tv since we got this", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Emily Groh"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "having  some  troubles", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Robert C Augenti"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Pretty good product for the money", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Craig Yarbrough"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Lots of great movies!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kurt Ditzel"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was expecting more Prime movies not ones I have to pay for.
