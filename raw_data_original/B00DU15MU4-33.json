Maybe it was protesting the working environment? Of course that would happen after the warranty period, that clever little remote! Luckily we downloaded the Amazon Fire TV app onto our tablet and using that. It's really not the best solution but the only one for now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jupiter"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Many apps not directly linked to amazon run poorly.

I like the interface and speed. Now whenever I turn it back on I have to unplug it then plug it back in to come on. Sometimes the sound will go off in the middle of a show and you pause or rewind and it comes back on. It freezes occasionally also. I've had a Roku 2 in the bedroom for a couple years and it still works great. I've talked to a couple of friends and they have the exact same issues. I think Amazon needs to work the bugs out of this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ForeSee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I purchased this when they were having the $50 discount for signing up with Sling for 3 months. I jumped on this deal so I could try installing Kodi on it since I was tired of my raspberry pi lagging. It was very easy to install and this thing is super fast. I originally had my raspberry hard wired, but with the Fire TV I can now stream movies to it with no buffering or lag issues!!! I am also a prime member so all the free prime videos are nice as well! I am very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend if you need a media player. Small, compact, and beats having a pc tower next to your TV.
