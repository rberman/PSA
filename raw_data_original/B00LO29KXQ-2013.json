Purchased mainly for HBOGo and Netflix which were easy to set up.  Only complaint is this:  my laptop and cell phone can stream off of the wi-fi signal in the same room as the TV/FireStick...but FireStick streaming lasts for all of 5 seconds then stops.  I am going to have to either move my wireless router (buy extension cords) or get a signal booster ($$).
