It's fast, lightning speed. The 2 gig comes in handy, it downloads while you watch and I have not seen any lagging or waiting for videos to load. Reliable, have not crashed so far. Outperform compared to Ruko and Apple 3 boxes. Apple 3 is fancy looking and very controlling. Fire TV lot lot faster than Apple 3. Ruko is not worth it. You should check it out and do yourself a service.

As I have an Amazon Prime account with a kindle fire, I felt it made sense to get this fire tv.  It works well and I also played a few games.  One of the games promoted lets you use the kindle fire hdx as a remote.  Pretty cool stuff.Cannot wait for my back ordered remote control.  I'm a casual gamer and rarely play.  However, this device makes it easy to just pick up a game any time without a lot of effort and time that goes into ps3.  Better than playing it on a tablet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dnelson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "800-531-5000I\u2019ve read some reviews, bashing the Fire TV, but this is a very new product with more to come.  When Roku firs came out, they didn\u2019t have all the channels they do now.  It took time to build up.  Out of the gate, the Fire TV has plenty of channels.I won\u2019t repeat all the things folks have said and write a 10 page thesis.  To be completely transparent, my previous device is a Roku 2 XD.  I am very excited about the possibilities this device has for future development.Speed - This baby is fast!  It leaves my Roku in the dust with menu navigation, no hesitation at all.  Although Netflix doesn\u2019t have the pre-watch buffering of the Amazon streaming app, my videos are loading twice as fast as with the Roku.Interface - While some have complained about the blandness of the interface, I welcome it.  It is a no-frills interface that I can navigate quickly through and get to what I bought the thing for, the content.Apps - The apps have a much better interface than the Roku apps.  They are much more user-friendly.Remote - While I love the remote functions and feel of the matte surface, it is awkward in my big hands.  It could be a bit longer.Voice Search - Awesome idea!  Some fuss because it is limited to only a couple apps.  Give it time.  The people developing these apps are not Amazon, but Amazon has opened this capability to them.Input - This is obviously a major need.  On-screen keyboards suck.  I\u2019m sure in time we\u2019ll have access to a bluetooth keyboard or, better yet, an Android app like for the Roku.Picture - The picture is better than my Roku, which often would have pixilation on darker parts of the picture.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "A.

We primarily got it so we could get Netflix - and I honestly had no idea all the other 'things' it could do. I won't lie, my son hooked it up for me, but it did seem super easy. I do wish the small, slim remote was neon green or shocking pink because it is really easy to lose track of,even when it's RIGHT THERE in front of you on the coffee table, let alone when it has slipped between couch cushions. I apologize to anyone looking for technical details, but I am clearly not the person for that sort of thing.
