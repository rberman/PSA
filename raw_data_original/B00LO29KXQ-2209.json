I bought this for my bedroom, as I have Apple TV in the living room. Pro: I'm able to use the Amazon Prime app.Cons: The layout of the main menu is not as organized as Apple, and it's hard to browse movies/shows in all the apps. It lags a bit too but ultimately it was good enough and it did it's job, but then I somehow misplaced the remote!!! So I downloaded the remote app and it takes 10 minutes for the app to locate my Fire Stick. I was going to buy another remote for it but that costs $15, so I decided to buy another Apple TV for the bedroom, and the Fire Stick will go in the guest room.Now that Apple TV is priced at $69 it's worth the extra $30 over the Fire Stick at $40. I think the stick needs to be priced lower, no more than $25.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "C.
