The only thing that came up in Orange is the new Black. Also we would search for something and when that choice showed upp in the lizt and we clicked on it something else would show up on the play list..  We are not al all pleased with this product so far. We also have 2 Roku 3's and they work great - even Netflix/", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Dave W."}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "i haven't purchased a firestick yet. However, with that in mind, I do have a chromecast and it does what this does, no issues. I dont understand the need for the next to useless remote, and I am not sold on the voice remote, which actually should be included instead of the crap remote.In addition, I think the manufacturers should start making these to plug into the router on your home network, then one stick one house! It doesn't make sense to buy 5 of these for every television, unless your a retailer selling the overpriced units or a manufacturer. Remember, flash drives cost like 4 bucks to manufacture.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/5", "author": "mark day"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use, I love the click and find my programs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have had the firestick for about 1 week now.  I purchased more of curiousity due its low price, but I found that is a highly functional gadget.  I have Google TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, and multiple Rokus. In my opinion this is better than the comparably priced Chromecast as it comes with a full function remote and doesn't rely on my phone.Pros:- Supports HBO, Showtime, Plex, Netflix, Pandora, Amazon among others.- There is an app for real time streaming of CBS News -- nice for TV where I don't have cable- User interface is clean - tends to favor Amazon (but that would be expected)- Very Small - can't even be seen sticking out of side HDMI port on TV- Support for Amazon Music LibraryCons:-  A bit to Amazon heavy -- doesn't bother me, but many of the options (Movies, TV, Prime Video) are all Amazon-  Would be nice if I could stream from an iTunes server without having to upload to Amazon Music Library", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "PrimeAddict"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install and perfect to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Martha J.

It works amazingly well.I was even able to get it to show up on the menu.  The amount of effort to get that working was more than normal folks could deal with I am afraid.  That said once working it's fantastic.The sad part was I could not get my S5 mirror to work.  There are others just like me so I am not alone.

This is coming from a guy who already owns a Chromecast and Apple TV streaming device so take from this what you will.Pros:- Easy to setup. You order it and it's already registered to you so it's basically plug and play.- Very nice interface.- Has most the apps you would expect except HBOgo which I guess is coming Spring 2015.Cons:- Even if you're an Amazon Prime member there are so few Prime ready movies out there that this isn't worth it on that note alone so you're really looking at it for other apps which then puts it in the same market as the other streaming devices.- Almost all the games require the sold separately game controller so you won't be able to play them.- The included remote is alright but it's very similar to the Apple TV remote where you have to use the click wheel to navigate an on screen keyboard to type letters when you want to enter a password, email address or search term. Alternatively, you can buy a remote with voice search or download an app that allows you to voice search.- It feels like another separate device you have to turn to in order to watch your movies.I don't use my Apple TV anymore and that's really the closest thing I can compare this to. I don't use this anymore either. I have an Android phone and use Chrome on my computer so with my Chromecast device I just select the movie I want to watch on either device and can \"cast\" it to my TV and back again. It's much simpler and faster.With the Fire TV and the Apple Tv I feel like they are separate devices that I have to turn to in order to watch what I want to watch. It's always on but It feels less intuitive and like a slower process.As a whole, the device works great and is quick, but in my situation it just feels a bit outdated next to my Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John K"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I bought the Fire TV Stick primarily as a PLEX client.
