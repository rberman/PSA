I already have an Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Ouya all hooked up at home, but I'm a huge fan of Amazon products, plus Amazon's first party effort in gaming is far superior to its set-top box competitors (Apple, Google, Roku). So I purchased the Fire TV with the game controller and I've been toying with it over the past week! Here are my impressions:+ Clean, easy-to-navigate interface+ Voice search works well+ Relatively easy to sideload Android apps (for those who are inclined to do so)+ Some really solid launch games (mostly carryovers from Kindle products) like Fire-exclusive Sev Zero, Minecraft, and Walking Dead, but...\u2212 There aren't many truly compelling games, and the sold-separately controller required to play some of them is a bit awkward to operate\u2212 At launch there is a lack of some apps consumers may want, such as HBO Go and a web browser\u2212 Inoperable USB port\u2212 Only 8 GB of memory (I believe about 5.5 GB is usable), mine filled up FASTRight now, I can undoubtedly say the Fire TV is a nondescript little black box that packs a tremendous punch. However, if you already own a current-gen game console, Apple TV, Chromecast, or a smart TV, it might be wise to hold off on purchasing for now, only because the Fire TV is not really ground-breaking enough at this point to do a whole lot more than what you already have. If you've held off on a set-top box or smart TV this long though, the Fire TV is a no-brainer. Personally, I think it will gradually get better as Amazon adds more capabilities to the device with future software updates. And if Amazon follows through with creating must-have first party video (a la Netflix) and game (a la Xbox) content, this product may truly set the market ablaze.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Matthew W Buckley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I will have to say that the Amazon Fire TV is a fantastic device and I\u2019m surprised by some of the negative reviews. First let me say I also own a Roku 3 and Apple TV so I am fairly familiar with the other major players in this space (Google who?). This device is comparable to a Roku and actually in my opinion much better (Not a fan of the current Apple TV at all).Setup to streaming literally took minutes. I\u2019m a Prime member so it came already setup with my account information. Yes there was a software update but it could not have taken more than 3mins to complete (I guess all the people complaining need to upgrade from Dial Up service). I was also very impressed by the overall layout of the menus and the blazing speed at which it loaded content.Yes Roku has HBO Go and Amazon does not but to me that\u2019s not a major deal (again I also have a Roku). A lot of reviewers laud Roku\u2019s larger library of available channels but outside of HBO Go, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and perhaps Crackle the other channels are B-list at best (no offense Kung Fu Channel). The voice search is ok but will be better once they integrate it for use across streaming channels. Games are a nice add as well, I don\u2019t have the game controller and so far using the remote is fine.So, Amazon provides a near flawless setup, menu interface, and channel options. Not to mention very fast load times and integration with your Amazon Kindle Fire (if you have one, I don\u2019t).

Straight out of the box I had issues downloading a mandatory update, it took a few tries.  It really seemed to come down to not liking my connection speed which is only 1mbps (that is the best I can get in my area).  After that it was no issue, it does seem to handle my slow connection speed fairly well.  Picture and sound were good as well.Pros:Already came preconfigured with my accountSmall and sleek very easy to hide but not necessary.remote small, sleek, and easy to useHandled slow connection very wellAndroid based so integration of existing android apps will be quickly adaptedCons:No phone app to make phone a controllerVoice Search only searches Amazon contentAccessing local content can only be done via another app i.e. Plex", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "w33mhz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was my first experience with a streaming device.
