I purchased this gift for my mom so that she could watch my streaming accounts on her TV. The Roku stick does this with ease. It's simple enough for her to understand without trouble at all.The only complaint I have is very minor. The remote sometimes quits working. It simply takes removing a battery and putting it back in. It's a very minor complaint, but it's the only thing that kept me from making this a 5 star review.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carrie Moore"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is not my first roku. Actually it's my fifth! My cat ate the power cord on one of them, so this time I got another streaming stick and a TV-sourced usb charger. (That thing is awesome too, btw) It has been a while since I've had to set one up so I was surprised to see the Time Warner channel. They are my cable provider, but I don't have cable running into my bedroom. Well, long story short, now I do! My boyfriend is beside himself and there's a sleep timer on that tv so I am also pretty psyched. (I never could sleep with the TV running all night) This way we get to watch stuff that you don't want your 10 year old to walk in on =)Thanks, roku!!!
