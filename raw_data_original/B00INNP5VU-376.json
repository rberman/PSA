The installation was easy. I got memberships in all the places I needed fairly easily. I followed the instructions to get the Roku connected to my WIFI and the Roku responded well. The first thing I realized when I started using the Roku was the limited amount of movies and TV shows I could get for free. It seemed that every time I selected something I needed to pay extra for it. The second thing was there was no \u2018\u2019 SEARCH\u2019\u2019 in the menu as indicated in the brochures I had read.I then got into a chat with someone at Roku and asked all my questions. It took about one hour in order to get all my answers which turned out to be only one answer: you can only get all you want if you live in the USA including the \u2018\u2019SEARCH\u2019\u2019 feature.I then proceeded to obtain and install new USA memberships, a new IP for USA (cost of $4.31/month), and reconnected my Roku to this new USA IP and voila I had my \u2018\u2019SEARCH\u2019\u2019 in the menu and hundreds more opportunities for movies and TV shows.The only thing is that after all that I still have to pay extra in most cases for what I am interested in.Overall the Roku works very well technically but in real life it does not improve my viewing unless I am willing to pay extra for LULU, NETFLIX, AMAZON, etc..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "cervotel"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Poor!! This was my second Roku (had a Roku 3). Remote linking issues every time I wanted to use it. Called Roku Customer Service, they blamed my router. Funny how I have no issues with any other device including my Roku 3. I have since returned this product and purchased another Roku 3 (no issues).", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thomas Albanese"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy...Peasy..so easy to get started. Crisp clear, as if I'm watching broadcast television. Quick, precise. HIGH QUALITY!  Easy to cast from my phone to the roku stick just click one button.
