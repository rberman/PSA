I received the stick two weeks ahead of schedule (I ordered on the day of release but was scheduled for 12/19/14 delivery). I didn't have to install a software update, as many reviewers referenced, so they must have taken care of it before hand. I connected to my wi-fi easily and have had no issues with the remote response times nor with buffering or dropped connections. I wish there was a TV power on/off and volume buttons on the remote to integrate the FireTV further into the viewing experience but am still happy with the product as is. Can't beat it for 20bucks and I like it more than the chromecast I've had for years.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Josh L"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This is not a bad product by any means, but you should know going in that it is 100% centered around being a Prime Member. The interface is built to give you access to Prime & other Amazon content above all else.My issues with it:I have the Roku stick that I've had for a few months prior to the Fire Stick being delivered. The Roku interface is far super in my opinion, it gives all of your 'channels' equal ground and lets you organize them however you want. With the Fire Stick it gives you your most recently viewed/used apps at the top of the screen, then 'featured apps' - this would be fine if I could some how choose what is displayed in the 'Featured apps' area but now it just seems like a random order. Thankfully it usually has Netflix up there consistently so there isn't any digging for that.There also doesn't seem to be an easy way to remove apps/channels (maybe I'm just missing it?). I see that I can remove them online in my account (similar to adding/removing Roku channels). But in the online interface it warns that deleting them there would cause them to not work on any devices they were installed on, which to me says that it will not remove it from the Firestick, it will just cause it to not function correctly any more.The good:While I do have some initial gripes about it, it is a good product. It's just not as well designed as the Roku. It does perform well. Surfing through menus and lists is quick and relatively easy.I would recommend this to anyone with a Prime Membership. Otherwise I'd say just get a Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Phillip-PDX"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Good addition to my HD Panasonic TV.

I pre-ordered back when they were on sale and they just showed up in the mail yesterday along with an Amazon Fire Tv (the larger version). Setup was really easy. I primarily got this to watch my Plex library. Bought the app and started my first movie. Worked for 5 minutes and then the movie froze. No network connection. Tried for 45 minutes alternating between my 2.4GHz & 5GHz network (both with excellent signal according to the Fire Stick) and the device failed to ever reconnect to the WiFi. I was also using the included power adapter. Frustrated, I unpackaged the Fire Tv and set it up on the same Tv and the same WiFi network. Have watched a few movies and there have been no problems whatsoever with the WiFi on the larger Fire Tv. It hasn't lost connection once. I'll hold on to the Fire Stick in hopes that a firmware fix is possible to fix these problematic WiFi problems, but for now its back in the box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Joe Hemi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard Jacobs"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I had really high hopes for the Fire Stick.  First off, Amazon never shows it as a product that has to be powered by electricity, It needs to be plugged in.  Actually not the end of the world, but I sort of felt that this was not made clear in the advertising.  Secondly, it keeps dropping the signal.  That is a pretty serious issue for a device that streams video.  Now, I could live with this if I felt I had a dodgy wireless network, I happen to have a good one and the device that the fire stick replaced rarely dropped the signal.  Basically this is a downgrade on a Samsung device I put in 4 years ago. Technology has improved over the last 4 years, so I feel disappointed that the fire stick's performance is not better.When the video is working, the interface is very well designed and easy to navigate and the picture is excellent.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Mickey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Arthur natvig"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I'm only posting this to try and help those with WiFi issues..If you're having problems getting your Fire TV Stick staying connected to the internet, I recommend trying to move the TV Stick to another HDMI port. This worked for me, I went from having a consistently poor connection to really good just by moving it to another port. I know that many of us are unable to do so with certain setups, I just advise you try this before giving up. I also don't know if this limited to a certain batch, or only a few units, I just know that from skimming through the 1-star reviews, this seems to be a pretty common issue. Hopefully this is something Amazon eradicates in future HW revisions, because from what I can tell, software could not fix this.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "mateo124 \"matthew\""}]
