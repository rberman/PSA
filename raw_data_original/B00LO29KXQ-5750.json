I have it plugged into an Onkyo receiver, which is connected to a projector. I'm happy that worked well. It was so easy to get it going. I think it took almost 5 minutes to set up & I'm sure that was because my internet is slow. At any rate, I can finally play my music in the living room. I do wish it would play ALL of my music, as opposed to the same 15 albums.The Amazon mobile app to use as a remote is...unimpressive. But I'm finding that using my phone with other apps is pretty cool. Not sure they should tout the games. Most of them cost money and none of those are actually worth playing with the remote.This thing has made my Blu-Ray player obsolete. I only use that for the apps and this has all the same apps that I use. My Xbox is only going to be play games again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anika Malone \"Anika Malone\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Fast.
