This is very fast and portable. While I mostly use it for Hulu Plus (which does require a subscription fee), I use it for Amazon Prime Instant and Pandora too. There are many other options.  It was very easy to connect to my tv.  It probably took me less than 5 minutes from box to using it.The only thing I notice as a difference between amazon fire tv and fire tv stick is the optical audio out option on fire tv, but the sound is still very good.  I have my optical audio on the fire tv hooked to an stereo system so if you have one, you may opt for the additional cost.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jill W. \"Jill\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the Fire Stick, it is so easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charlotte H."}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Constant trouble with getting Fire Stick to connect to Wifi.
