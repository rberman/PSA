[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I purchased this for my mother because, unlike a chromecast, the Fire TV Stick has a dedicated remote.  Unfortunately, the interface is extremely Amazon centered and, as my mother isn't very good with technology and the interface doesn't allow the user to filter out content that has an additional cost vs. content that is free with your Amazon Prime Instant Video service, she is always fearful that she will accidentally buy something and avoids the Amazon Video Content entirely.  I guess it is a win-win for Amazon.  They get the money and accidental purchases or they don't have to render any services and get the money for free.Also, the voice search functionality only works with Amazon Instant Video and, because of the above mentioned limitation, is therefore useless.  If it weren't for the fact that older generations are often more comfortable with a dedicated remote I'd honestly have preferred a chromecast. She is, however, managing with the Fire TV Stick well enough.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patrick"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's cool to have all the APP \"in\" the device and be able to navigate using the remote.
