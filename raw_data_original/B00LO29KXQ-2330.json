Upgraded to this and I like it so far. Only issues is that it has problems connecting to my Wi-Fi router one room away. It has to buffer a lot. Im sure it will be fine once I move the router into the same room. Other than that, very quick to navigate.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Samantha Rose"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Beulah tackett"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really cool", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patrice Dell_granderson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my Fire TV Stick.
