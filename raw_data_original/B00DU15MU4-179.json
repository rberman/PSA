Many great features and performance is generally excellent. However, even when connected by Ethernet, Plex streaming performance is poor with a lot of buffering. This is despite having a high end server that never exceeds 50% CPU. Using a Roku 3 it works as desired, so the problem is either with the Plex Fire TV app or the device itself. Disappointing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Mark"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product, I highly recommend it!  Easy set-up & clear instructions.
