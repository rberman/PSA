I was pretty excited setting it up but that soon faded as I realized that I was shipped a defective remote.  I even tried using a second set of batteries.  Nothing!  The remote is within a foot of the Fire TV box and I tried holding down the home button for over 5 seconds.  Nothing!  The system is completely useless without a remote.  There's no way of requesting that just the remote be replaced.  My only option is to ship the entire system back to Amazon and re-order it.

For example, I couldn't stream my own (local) content, which is my primary source. Also, voice search doesn't work in apps besides Amazon's. Furthermore, apps not in the Amazon Appstore, are extremely difficult to use, not to mention install. I think if the system was opened to more 3rd party sources, I would enjoy it much more. I was hoping I could use this for XBMC, but it was so crippled, and constantly stuttering whether in the ui, or watching video.I wasn't really getting anything I couldn't already get in terms of Amazon services, from say my PS4. The only thing I liked, was the remote. There's definitely room for improvement, but right now it's just not worth it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "John Dembeck"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this little box, i could never watch netflix and  my movies on a TV until I got this. It was amazing how quite it was to set it up. Would recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I feel like I'm being a little generous on the 3 stars because at the end of the day, it works and plays video content well at a seemingly high quality. It operates vaguely the same way as most of the otherThat's the main pro. It also comes set up with your account info, which is certainly convenient but be careful if you order one and it turns up missing.The cons are mostly nuisances, but there are many:The set up is simple but it forces you to watch the most ridiculously stupid intro instructional cartoon ever with no skip option. If your product isn't user friendly enough to use out of the box with a simple written help guide (or a user friendly help button), you should fire your designers.The user interface is AWFUL and it requires wayy more steps to get to the netflix app than should be needed. I'm not really a fan of AppleTV, but they do a much better job. The \"home\" menu is really the Amazon streaming services app, that also includes menu options for other apps. I get why they'd want to do this, but it means that it's not really very convenient unless you only use Amazon streaming (which lets face it, is no where near as comprehensive as netflix).It completely assaults you with TV, movie, and app choices, but doesn't offer very good refined choices.There doesn't seem to be any option to only see free/prime choices, which is the biggest complaint I have. It also doesn't even separate movies you can only buy versus ones you can rent. Without these filters it's sort of like just surfing the entire amazon site but without the convenience of a keyboard to type in searches and added filters.On top of that, so many of the apps it is pushing on you seem completely irrelevant and more suited to a smartphone. There's no sense of whether the options you're seeing are specifically for prime or just whatever random app will happen to work on prime.For some reason, my TV reset it's viewing options, including the \"soap opera effect\" and the energy star mode (which wayy overcontrasts and gives everything a blue/cool tone) - could be my TV, but either way it makes me wary.The device itself is relatively ugly and cheap looking --a small black plastic box. The remote is even more flimsy and not particularly intuitive for all situations (I'm sure this will improve once I get used to it--maybe this is why they needed that video).I don't think this thing is even close to worth $100 and I have a feeling it'll be half that soon. This alone makes me leaning toward returning it before the 30-day trial.Very small thing: The plug is relatively big and won't fit on many power strips without taking up two spots (and I have a smart power strip that I have no intention of replacing and no room for this). I haven't looked into whether this needs to be \"always on\", but that's a complete deal breaker for me.So anyhow, I've almost talked myself into a 2-star review, but I think a lot of my issues with it are really just software upgrades. In general, I'm leaning toward returning it, but plan on giving it at least another week or two.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/6", "author": "clevernonsense"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have used Google TV, Chromecast and other methods of watching online content on my HD TV, but Amazon Fire TV has provided the best experience so far.
