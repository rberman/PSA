[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "The device looks good and has a snappy UI, unfortunately it hangs/crashes frequently and reports a slow internet connection despite the fact that I'm on fiber and every other device sharing the router has no similar problems. Even choked playing content we own on Amazon's streaming service. Reverted back to my old Roku 2 and everything was peachy. Will try again when the product has time to mature and the price falls. My guess is that my problems can be fixed with a firmware update sometime down the road. But no reason for me to sit on the device until then, so in the return pile it goes.My recommendation, wait a bit longer for the kinks to be worked out before you buy one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/10", "author": "Eric Knipp \"Eric Knipp, Gartner\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was very excited when this product was announced and order it immediately. However I am not impressed with the apps available and even the ones like Netflix are bad. This probably has the worst netflix app interface of any of the multiple devices I own. And being that I got this to use my primevideo too that I appreciate. But still need to keep chromecast to have a decent netflix interface for it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/5", "author": "Nathan"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have two Apple TV's and was about to try a Google Chrome when I saw that Amazon was releasing the Fire TV. I'm heavily invested in Amazon with a Kindle Fire HDX, a Prime membership, and even an Amazon credit card. With my Amazon credits I got the unit plus controller for less than an Apple TV. It showed up yesterday and I've been very pleased with the functionality and mainly the speed. Compared to Apple TV it is the clear winner. The voice search feature works as advertised with the one exception that I've found so far is that Clint Eastwood is translated as Klint Eastwood who apparently has never done a movie, ever. I've tested the mirror option on the Kindle Fire and it works great compared to the NetGear mirror option I used previously. Overall, no regrets on this purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "David W.

I've been using Roku devices (Original, XS, & 3) for years now and the Fire TV takes the cake. Much snappier menu response due to the better hardware specs.
