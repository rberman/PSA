[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "It works fine but the marketing is misleading.  To see things like an HBO series or any other premium channel's series, you have to pay your provider for that channel and THEN you can see them on Amazon Fire.  I don't see the point and almost sent the Amazon Fire TV back. If I subscribe to a premium channel using my service, I can see everything through normal service and there's no need for the extra gadget.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AW"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really have enjoyed this device. It is pretty fast and the voice recognition is awesome. I could not stream vudu, but my tv does so that is not that big of a deal. I have not had a chance to play many games yet but it is just another added feature. I decided to get the game controller but it has not arrived yet. I am happy with this device even without the games. If you are a Amazon Prime member, this is the best choice for streaming.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Curtis R \"\" C J \"\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Small, compact and easy to set-up.
