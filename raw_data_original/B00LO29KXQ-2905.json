The device lags, skips, and freezes often. Yet those aren't the reasons I'm most disappointed. It would be great if I only watched Prime shows since the setup is geared toward Amazon. But watching via other apps is tedious because you must click through so many categories to get to them; it\u2019s almost like a game of hide and seek.  A simpler layout would be a REMARKABLE improvement. Then Amazon must work on the problems with freezing, etc. Until then, I\u2019m going back to my old Roku box.UPDATE: Today (June 20, 2015) I finally couldn't take it anymore and reconnected my old Roku box. There are some nice features to the Fire stick and my teens like the game apps, but none us could continue to tolerate the consistent freezing of the picture ... while the audio continued. It was interesting watching the speedy motion as the picture moved to catch up with the audio, but not enough to continue with the Fire Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NanC"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Best.
