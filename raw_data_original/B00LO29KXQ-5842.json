[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Great idea, but needs refinement.I love the easy access to my Amazon watchlist and the ability to check out my favorite shows on Netflix. That's what drew me to the Fire TV Stick. It replaced an outdated HDMI wifi converter for a Samsung TV.First - this thing is loud. I watch TV at night when my partner is sleeping. The clicking noise the remote makes is unnecessarily loud - imagine trying to click through 100 episodes of your favorite show. Terrible.Second - there's no backlight on the remote and there's no tactile feedback (small nubs) on any of the buttons to help orient you.Third - the stick lost connection 3 times during the first hours of use. The only way to fix it was to unplug it from its power source and wait 3 seconds. The feedback provided by the device when this happened was unnecessarily obtuse. I resorted to online forums for help.Fourth - the browsing experience is subpar. It feels like work rather than a joy to browse for something to watch. Browsing shouldn't feel like you're looking through a spreadsheet...Again, I love Amazon. I've been a Prime member for years. For me, the Fire TV stick is a great concept and I'll be sticking around for at least a few versions to see if Amazon can nail it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Cassie L.

But it was much more responsive and quick than I thought it would be. Simple and easy-to-use. The latter is important because it was for my 60 year old dad. Also, the setup was incredibly easy... hookup to TV and wall, select wifi, then say yes the account I ordered it from is the one I wanted it connected to and you're done.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nate"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "GREAT Finally working , the set up took like forever about 1 hour or more , had to put in my internet password 3 times as the update just crashed on me- the update it self is a long process -  and well the fact that amazon prime video is only for the US is a bummer as i am out of the US , but i only really wanted it for NETFLIX and FINALLLLY its working , you have to update your payment with the device through amazon on a web browser as in you need to go back and forth from the computer to the TV, unless you got a Laptop or a phone , wish it was all a bit more easy- but now its working all is good for now", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MR O"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Experiencing many of the same issues others have noted here; it says connected with problems. I can't figure out what that relates to, as every other device I own works without issue. It stops streaming to buffer, and then sits on 25%, repeatedly (every few minutes (2-3)). It does that so often that it is impossible to even follow a movie or tv program. I have tried everything I can think of, and nothing improves the performance. I can only conclude all of the issues are due to the fire tv stick being \"buggy\", as these issues are unique to it alone. I was disappointed that I only ordered one of these for $19, when I could have had two. Now I am glad I saved the other $19. I will probably hold on to it and hope for a firmware update that works the bugs out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jen"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I ordered one the day it was announced hoping to be able to travel with this instead of taking DVD movies when we travel as a family.  It works well at home connected to  home network, but is not able to connect to an active portal.  It does not have a web browser, so it is not able to connect to free WiFi or hotel WiFi that has an open connection , but requires a web login.

You don't need it if you have a smart TV which I have in my living room but it's really great for the smaller TV I have in the bedroom. It's much easier to use than the controls on my smart TV  or my smart Blu-ray player and it has a lot of fun apps.
