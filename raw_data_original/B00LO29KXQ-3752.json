It's extremely slow and glitchy (long load times / actions aren't snappy / disconnects from Wi-Fi network often when none of my other devices, including a Chromecast, do / etc.). I really dislike using it.The only thing it has going for it over my Chromecast is SlingTV. Even then, however, I have a more pleasant experience watching SlingTV on my computers. Currently, the Fire TV Stick is taking up an HDMI slot on my TV and I'm having trouble finding a good use for it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kenny O."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "as advertised", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael Harrison"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product if you already have a prime membership.
