I don't have a super-fast Internet connection--just DSL--but everything streams seamlessly and with perfect quality (at least as perfect as I need).

The Fire surpasses Apple TV in ease of use and channel selection. (As far as I'm concerned, the only reason to have Apple TV is for AirPlay.) However, I find the remote control and the general \"flow\" of the Roku to be more intuitive. That MAY simply be because I'm more familiar with it.... There are fewer steps involved in getting me from one place to the next with Roku. (Apple is the worst.)  Another thing to consider: I was quite curious to try the voice command option on the Fire. Alas it only works with Amazon Prime\u2014understandable\u2014but if the show I want to watch isn't on Prime, it's a non-starter. And a lot of the shows I'm looking for are not on Prime.Would I recommend? Mostly yes. Unless you already have multiple streamers. It's a good solid machine with a couple of neat features, but it doesn't beat Roku.
