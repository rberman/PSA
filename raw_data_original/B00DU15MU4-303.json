My cable bill is now around $80, down from $165+.  So paying $.99/episode of a current show is a steal, and it can be set up to automatically download the night it's released- I also have a Tivo Roamio which has Amazon Prime access, but the Fire TV's quick navigation not waiting for content to buffer is night and day from my Tivo boxI read a review that said this box was fast, but had no soul.  I will agree to some extent, but it was really easy to set up and I liked the simplicity of the interface, much much much more than the Apple TV interface.Other things I love:- X Ray:  super cool way to see the actors, music, etc when you press pause - just like the X Ray feature in the Kindle- Remote:  It's a nice soft, rubber feel that has a unique texture and is comfy in the hand.  A little on the light side....but again, so much better than the Apple remote- Apps:  You can subscribe to as few or as many apps as the Fire TV supports - like HBOGo or Netflix.  It's easy to sign up, and far less wonky to navigate on the Fire TV than other streaming devices I've usedI haven't ever used a Roku, but if you're at your wits end with your other streaming devices and are heavily invested in a Prime account - you should  seriously considering the Fire TV box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scorpio11 \"Scorpio11\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "just got it for the walking dead but its alright. wish it was a little bit cheaper", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "George S"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Heath  W  Larson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome gadget!

I had a Boxee and an Apple TV before this and this is just such a better value.I was hesitant to try the Roku 3 because of the clunky remote, strange UI and it being a \"new\" ecosystem for myself. Since I'm already established as an Amazon customer the fire tv was a much more seamless to integrate into my tech ecosystem.Very happy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DJ"}]
