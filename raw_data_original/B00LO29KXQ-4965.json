Some movies had buffering issues.  But what do you want for free, right?  Many of the movies offered through Prime require a payment. So I linked my device to a third party source to get movies and TV for free.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought the Fire BOX and not the Stick.  I read that theFire BOX has better hardware installed, and it comes with a \"Voice Search\" Microphone (the Stick does not).  All in all, it is worth the money.
