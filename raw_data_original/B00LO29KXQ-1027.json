[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Still learning how to use it and what is a free service and a pain service. Thought we would get more with our Amazon Prime but its tricky you may click on what you think is FREE and still see a change. No Fault of Amazon just that learning curve. The Device was quick and easy to set up and the remote comes in very handy. For the price I could not pass it up. So of the downloaded Apps are nice but they seem to be limited on what you would expect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Steve of PA"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best thing I've purchased in awhile!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Ian"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The TV Stick works great, we just plugged it into the HDM1 port & started watching & enjoying a variety of TV shows & movies.
