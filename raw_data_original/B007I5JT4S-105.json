I love it. I'm addicted to watching Netflix- or YouTube videos on the big screen. If you want a fabulous little box that connects you to the world- purchase the AppleTV. If you want to not sit on your couch and binge watch The Orange is the New Black in style- don't buy this. The remote is super simple and easy to learn. My 6 year old picked it up in no time. The only thing I will say is that tthe remote is super tiny so sometimes it gets lost in the couch and I have to physically stand up to find it- bummer, I know.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jean"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product, but no way to watch anything from your amazon prime account easily.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lindsey deMont"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Only good things to say about Apple TV, this was purchased for the stand alone HBO NOW app works great couldn't be more pleased.
