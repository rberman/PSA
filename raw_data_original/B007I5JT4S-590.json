Why get an Apple TV?  Apple iPad integration, iTunes library access on my HDTV, and a need for speed!Side by side the Apple TV device blows my Roku away in terms of grabbing streaming content, buffering it, and getting it to play.  I love that!  Apple TV also offers up the cool features of syncing with my iTunes library and AirPlay with my iPad.  I love that too!What I don't love about the Apple TV is that it doesn't support Amazon Instant Video.  Maybe with future upgrades or generations it will, but for now, this newest version doesn't and that gives the advantage to Roku in terms of programming options.Roku also offers a bunch more 'channels' to surf than Apple TV, but Apple TV's ability to stream podcasts from iTunes evens things out for me.If you have HBO, you can use the AirPlay function to stream HBO content via the Apple TV to your HDTV.  AirPlay also allows iPad users to mirror what they are doing on their iPad to an HDTV with Apple TV connected to it.Apple TV gives you options like a plethora of Internet radio stations to listen to, FLICKR, and sports subscription channels.The downside to Apple TV is the price, but despite that, I'm glad I spent nearly double what I paid for my Roku on this device.  It's sleek interface runs smoothly (update it when you hook it up so you have the latest firmware) and quickly, and Netflix, HuluPlus and YouTube look great when played on the Apple TV.With AirPlay (super cool way to stream video from your iPad to your TV) and a free iTunes app called 'Remote', you can play your downloaded movies and TV programs from iTunes via the Apple TV.If you don't have an iTunes account, music library or iPad, you may want to stick with Roku with the bonus of a lower price and Amazon Instant Video.Apple TV is great except for its lack of Amazon syncing and limited channel add-ons.  Despite those faults (and the reason for the 4 out of 5 rating), it's really a fantastic piece of hardware with impressive speed and Apple product integration, making it worth a purchase in my book.7/1/13 - UPDATE:Be sure to do the software update to this device when prompted, or check in settings for the update.  This latest update seems to have helped the speediness of the transitions and optimized the Apple TV.  A slight update to the visual interface is nice too.  Unfortunately, Amazon Instant Video is not yet part of the update.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Andrea Polk"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So cool to now be able to watch Netflix and Hulu on my big screen TV, wirelessly no less!

I am now downloading media to my ipad and using the airplay feature, which I really love.  I can be listening to music on my iphone in the kitchen and mid-song change the playback to the living room tv when I switch rooms.

I own a lot of digital content and have ripped my movie collection so I can take it on the go. Streaming this content to my TV is very easy with this device. The content is maintained through iTunes and it's a simple matter of turning on Home Sharing on your computer, and signing in on the Apple TV. Obviously a wired connection is preferable but I've found a wireless connection works fairly well also. I've only had a buffering issue a few times but blame that on my old wireless router.The UI is similar to that of an iPhone or iPad; there are multiple apps available for the user to choose from (most of them existing services you need to sign up for) and it's as easy as signing in to use the apps. We use this for Netflix, Hulu, and MLB TV, all of which work great on the device.The device is small (the remote even smaller) so you won't have to take up a lot of valuable space on your entertainment center to enjoy it. I own two of these now and have loved having them. If you use iTunes a lot to manage your content, give this a try.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dan Thompson"}]
