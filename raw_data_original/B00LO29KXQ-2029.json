I have a ROKU for my office TV but instead of buying another one for my bedroom I decided to buy the fire stick.  I was lucky enough to catch the fire stick on sale which was my first plus.  2nd this was SO easy to set up.  I love the options it has as well.  I have been able to watch Hulu Plus, Netflix and a bunch of other channels with it...no problems at all.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "N.

Set-up was a breeze and didn't take very long for me because I already had my Netflix and Hulu accounts.  I am very happy with this purchase.

Unfortunately, Amazon did not say that it requires a newer HDMI port. After 45 minutes on the phone with an exceptionally helpful Amazon tech, she determined that the stick was not supposed to work with my four year old TV b/c the HDMI ports were not new enough. The stick does work, however, it causes interference with regular channels - the options...send it back for a refund or keep it and only plug into the TV when we want to use it. We are keeping it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JR"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David Giocolo"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Installation was so quick and easy.
