I was expecting a lot more speed with the dual core chip but it still seamed slower than the Roku stick. The menu software is not the easiest to navigate. The bar menu on the side seems confusing to get to other popular apps such as netflix, crackle, etc. Also, I didn't understand why I have to have this extra 2 inch cable connected between the stick and the TV for \"best performance\" as Amazon recommends. Isn't that that point of having a stick? No extra cable? Also, my TV works great to power the Roku stick from the USB port so I don't have to have a AC cable connected. With the Fire Stick it notified me that my USB port was not an acceptable power source for the fire stick. That was another let down.  The Roku stick is still my favorite for ease of use and functionality.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "jason rozell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "There is no ask question section here so I am posting here, I tried scaling and resolution changes but have hadno font size increse.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nels Dahlquist \"tikizone\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Available movie selection is disappointing.

It is a bargain. It works well with The Firestick Android APP.There are some complaints with 'mirroring' but I have not tried with Amazon Kindle, and I suspectthat it may be more of a problem with the Android software than the Fire Stick. All in all, I would recommentd thisto all Prime customers, without reservation. I have a Google Chromestick as well and I like it too, but this unitaugments the Amazon experience seamlessly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Was quite surprised that it actually ran fine on a 5 gbps DSL connection.  My smart tv would run like crap, constantly buffering.  I\u2019m using a 30 mbps cable conection on it and it still buffers and gets confused when paused sometimes.  On the negative side, it's pretty limited for other apps.  Roku was better.  You can get Netflix, Youtube, and Hulu Plus, and a couple useless junk apps.  Also the remote is really flimsy, freezes and has to be put to sleep and woke back up sometimes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Roy A. Lay"}]
