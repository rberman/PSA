It worked ok for a while but then stopped working all together.  I had an Apple TV wired up to the main room before (I moved it downstairs for music).  I ordered this one to stream music (house wide).  Its worked like a champ.  Easy setup and I like that it displays whats playing on the TV.  I don't really use it for much other than streaming music or accessing Netflix online", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Armstrong"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I think the Apple TV competitors are better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Garnett R.
