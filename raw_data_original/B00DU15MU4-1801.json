[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "This is a nice device. Good hardware, software, etc... but it has a big deal breaker for me. The remote is Bluetooth only, so I can't control it with my Logitech Harmony Universal remote (IR only), so I'm going to have to return it.Someday, everything will be low power Bluetooth (including my universal remote) and that will be great.

Was going to buy the fire stick, but since it was out of stock until 1/15/15, I went for the Fire TV. So glad I made this choice. After talking with some techy friends, they told me to go for this and put up the extra $60.00. Well worth it!!! I was also once a Roku user, and I do love Roku, but I would pick Fire TV over Roku any day. You can play games with the remote or you can buy a controller for the Fire TV. You cannot access all games with the remote, but they do offer a nice selection for the remote. you can access tons of amazon instant videos, Hulu, Netflix and more. I love my Fire TV :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jennifer Lock-Horev"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Amazon Fire TV!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Darwin or Tana Baker"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I am not satisfy with product...GUI is quite complex", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/9", "author": "alpesh"}]
