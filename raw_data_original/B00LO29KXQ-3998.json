I debated on whether or not to purchase this or the actual Fire TV. Since my main TV is a smart TV, I was mainly looking to purchase this for the secondary TV we have for the kids. I settled on the Stick and have yet to have a single day where it actually works. My Internet services have never given me problems with my phone, tablets or Smart TV. But when we try to use the Stick on any given day, I continually have \"connection problems\". Although on my phone or tablet it shows no issues. We have yet to be able to watch a single movie, although we have played a couple of games. I am seriously debating on returning my product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Natalie Valle-Garcia"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very simple to learn, use and navigate. The screen is very clean with one column and various rows to select content.

Poor internet connectivity; oftentimes it will struggle to stay connected during Netflix or WatchESPN even if the network is fine on my computer or phone.2. Limited app availability means that there are some streaming services or apps I'd like to cast from my phone or computer but I can't.3.
