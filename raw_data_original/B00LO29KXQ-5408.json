At $20 they are a STEAL. At $40, better to go for Roku.Few apps, but they are 1080p which is great. Remote is also not IR, which makes it a lot more usable especially for a stick which is probably behind the TV.UI is more cluttered than Roku as well, but certainly usable.My only major gripe is the text size and it is NOT ADJUSTABLE. Usable on my 55\" Living room TV, but on my 32\" bedroom TV the text can't be read from the bed. Roku however is just fine on same 32\" TV with bigger text.For a 1.0 product, pretty good though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ziloni"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mck"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's just as great as I thought it would be", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jhonneri Munoz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This little dude is the berries and for the price  you cant beat it.If you want youre tv to work its maximum get one of these", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John rose"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "it replace my roku hd, so much better , and it runs off my tv's usb portI love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David LaCure"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It keeps loosing the wifi signal and then cannot locate any wifi when there are at least 3 in the vicinity.

It looks pretty much the same, works pretty much the same, only remote is slightly better (my opinion). 5 GHz wireless wass pretty much broken and I couldn't get it to work (this seems to be a pretty common complaint). However, 2.4 GHz works ok. USB connector is on the side - some people will love it, some people will hate it - depending on HDMI connector orientation.User interface is reminiscent of Windows Media Center and works reasonably good. If you used anything like this in last few years, you'll adjust easily.Unfortunately, for those hopping to use Miracast, this stick won't be suitable since you need to get into menus to turn it on and it works only while that screen is opened. So forget about spur of the moment sharing - every time you will need to get into settings to turn it on once again.It is not that this stick is bad, but I personally find Roku slightly more comfortable and user friendly so, unless you can get this stick at a cheap price, I would pass.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Medo \"Josip Medved\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV stick has everything that I loved about the Fire TV, but none of the stuff that made me return the FireTV. I wish Amazon/Plesk would update the Plesk App and that Amazon Prime Video content was easier to search/discover, but hey I got XBMC running on this via sideloading and now have my video library running on every TV in the house.
