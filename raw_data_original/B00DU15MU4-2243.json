Amazon was, as always, forthcoming.)The reason I made the switch was Customer Service. I rarely had problems with my Roku but, when I did, it was a nightmare to get access and answers. I was hesitant when I found that the  two things that I had used consistently; Fire didn't have, ..the earphone jack on the remote and VUDU, a channel from which I've purchased some movies. The search, movement from selection to selection, are both mostly a matter of habit for  me (But I have to say I am becoming quite fond of the voice search - Maybe that's because my family doesn't respond  that well when I talk...I love Pandora and you can listen while you search, something that I love. I love  the Remote, it's  comfortable and since I'm having surgery on my arm this week, will be easier for me to use....Every thing else that I was pulling my hair out over has since become the preferred option. Of course  because I watch more since my illness, I'm still sure that, given time,  I would have reached the same conclusion. I.E...being able to jump ahead 5 selections at a time, the fact that I could search in the main menu and find all the movies in any channel The may be a way to do that and I'm just not as well informed as I need to be...we'll see. The bottom line is that the difference are usually just a matter of habit. I recommend the link with great Customer Service over others any day, and that's exactly what I  get with any Amazon product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Susan St. Vincent \"Amethyst Aardvark\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This thing is not DLNA certified nor does Amazon claim that it will stream my personal content (movies).

There are two youtube apps. In neither does fast forwarding work. I know, not an amazon app but that is a cop out.Amazon is responsible for the total experience. Trying to forward 3 minutes should not cause screen to blank.While Fire Tv is obviously focused on Amazon content I would like an easy way to put my apps also front and center and separate from recently watched.Really like but will not be using it for youtube any more, I'll use chromecast in which youtube works.Any chance Amazon can strike a deal with tv  networks and have their apps and their content available to Fire users without a cable subscription?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love watching. Amazon tv and being able rent a movie or purchase right from my tv. This little box is small enough to easily hide and I really don't have much negative to say about the remote, home screen or voice control. I am even able to watch Netflix on my amazon tv. Here is the only really problem I have..... It doesn't always want to connect or stay connect to the internet. I even had my high speed internet privider come to check our speed which was more than enough for the tv yet we still have issues sometimes with connection. We did learn after much research that you can't put the amazon box in a cabinet or shelf in a cabinet. It just won't work. Ours is set on the top of our tv cabinet next to the tv. If you can find a good line of site for the amazon tv box and your modem for internet then I would highly recommend this.

It replaced a PS3 that I had been using to connect to Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish when doing your voice searches that you had an option of having it only return Prime results instead of all the 'You will have to pay for this' results.  Others have already mentioned this as a negative and they are correct. You should have an option like \"All Results\" and \"Prime Results\".
