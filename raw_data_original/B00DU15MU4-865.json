We actually have 2 Fire TV's and one Fire TV Stick.  The picture is clear and no lag since we are running wireless.  I would recommend this to anyone.  We have Amazon Prime also and the selection of Free with Prime are great!  I had a Chromecast and was not happy with it at all, it lagged and had to have it connected to a computer to watch anything, and not all all broadcasts for Internet viewing work with Chromecast.  With the fire you can't surf the internet but not having that really does not limit the potential the Fire TV has.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "OceanSurfing23"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "i sometimes use it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I decided on the Amazon Fire TV because everything else I have done with Amazon (Kindles, shopping, whatever)  has been amazingly easy.

Netflix playback is jerky, freezes for just an instant then plays normally. It will do this maybe 5-10 times during a half hour show. It helps for a while if I reboot the Fire TV. It's so bad I have the Fire TV's power plug on a remote control outlet/lamp switch to reboot it.I have an old, old Roku, a smart TV and a cheapo android tablet that does not have this problem. I've tried hooking up the Fire TV as wireless and wired straight to the FIOS router, nothing helps.2. The only way to use a universal/infrared remote with the Fire TV is FLIRC. Amazon should have included an IR receiver.I waited too long to return it (my fault) so now I'm stuck with this stinkbomb.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/8", "author": "JimW \"JimW\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Haven't used it long enough to give a good review.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Doris J.

It's got tons of apps, but just makes watching video and listening to music very easy. You really need Amazon prime for it to be effective, but the two pair so well, it's worth it to always keep the prime membership.
