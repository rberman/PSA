[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have no idea how I lived without it. It's far superior to Roku, XBox, and all those other vehicles to run apps like Netflix and Hulu to the TV.  I have used both the XD Roku and XBox Live and Apple TV is far faster, runs smoother, and is easier to use; that alone would be enough to get it. On top of that though, you can play music or videos on the TV wirelessly from you Mac, IPhone, or IPad... But if you don't have any Apple products, it's still superior to the other devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JoDean"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy interface and complete integration with iTunes, Netflix, Pandor and your computer.  It's also fun to 'project' from your iPad or iPhone.

I just wish they would add Amazon VOD, but won't likely happen since they compete, so I have to switch to my Blu-Ray or Xbox to watch Amazon VOD.

I don't even need cable tv anymore, so I cancelled my Time Warner subscription and save $150 a month. Not bad, eh? If I want a show, I can buy it on Hulu. And I watch films on Netflix.

Apple TV saw my wireless internet right away and after some tweaking I was watching movies in no time. Just remember that you do need a HDMI cable.Pros: The usability was truly was better than what I expected. It allowed me to watch movies and listen to music from iTunes. I could also use my TV as an extension of my I-Pad which was an added bonus. This device will continue my use of Apple products for the time being.Cons: I think the only con for me is I live in an area where the internet is not that speedy. So by the time I am using wireless the Apple TV system can be slow. AKA: slow buffering and everything taking longer than it should. This is no fault of Apple TV just something to consider if you don\u2019t have fast internet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A. Freeman"}]
