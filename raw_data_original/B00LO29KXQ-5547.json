[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "UPDATE: I got the stick to work with my NETGEAR N600 (WNDR3700), however to get this working I had to re-work my entire WLAN because the FireTV stick does NOT support special characters in the SSID!The reason I am giving the device 3 stars and not more is because setup is a PITA, a device like this must support WPS to make WLAN config trivial and not depend on a display keyboard to enter the password.ORIG REVIEW: Beware this stick does not work with every wireless router, in my case I have a NETGEAR N600 (WNDR3700) and the stick is unable to connect on b/g/n and a/n networks, with or without a password.The distance between my router and the stick was less than 4 ft.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Sauraus"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very simple to set up and use.

It's so much faster to get where I want to be than through the TiVO, or the game box. I like how it automatically adjusted the screen size. I wish the Amazon music player had a shuffle all setting or channel creator like Pandora though. If it did I would probably just use this all the time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bhob"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Device loses network connectivity when it sleeps or idles. Network connectivity is restored when you unplug device from the TV and power-source (to restart the device) or upon factory reset. The device also froze once in the menu however all video streaming was just as good as my PS4 hooked up via Ethernet. I called amazon and after about 20-30 minutes they informed me it was a known issue and have shipped out a replacement  Fire TV stick. The device menu's looked good but felt very 'beta edition' to me. It seems like they could use a lot of work to get them up to the Kindle Fire standard. I would wait to buy this device until it has been on the market a bit longer and glitches are fixed but overall i am optimistic about the device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Emily"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It does not work with my tv (Samsung LN46B530P7F) at all.

I have the ssip the same on each,  but on different channels so my connection will transition seamlessly as I walk through the house. The fire stick does not work under these conditions.  I noticed when the FS scanned it didn't display all 4 of the connections, but displayed them as 2 connections even though they are addressed to different channels.
