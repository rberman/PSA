The first one is the fact that when you turn on the parental controls, you must enter your pin EVERY time you watch something, even when it is included in Amazon Prime.

I am thinking of returning it, my Roku works fine.Update 6/09.I figured out how to watch Netflix... Just had to click on \"download\".
