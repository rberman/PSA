Barnett \"barryb\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "A purchase that is cheap but comes with powerful uses.  Ease of use is very convenient.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that HDMI is recommended with power use and IPAD app could be little more use - There is nothing to use on the app other than voice command that searches Bing (Not sure why defaults to Bing however, Google, Yahoo would be nice)  .  So I had to locate a terminal.  Overall, ease of using with Amazon Prime and purchase is much easier than my century old Sony BlueRay Player's Amazon app. Browser will make this item fly to the stratosphere.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ZuluNiner"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My whole family enjoys and uses daily.
