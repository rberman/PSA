Roku has apps such as PBS that firestick does not currently have.  Roku's remote is more intuitive.  Firestick has a remote with a circle that you have to press right, left, up down to move and the middle for OK.  I prefer a remote that has the arrows.  Firestick is easier to access Amazon Prime (but not that much easier).  I initially had more trouble setting up the firestick.  It worked for a while and then it didn't.  Customer support though is excellent and we discovered together that your firestick must go directly into an outlet not a power saver outlet.  So I have both the roku and the firestick.  I like them both about the same.  One advantage to the firestick is the ability to mirror what is on your kindle.  We no longer have local television and are too far away to pick them up without a huge antenna.  During bad weather, I was able to get on the internet with my kindle, access the local news and mirror it.  Not a great picture but it was adequate.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sushicatlover \"sushicatlover\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Quick and easy - was up and running in minutes", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kim D"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The Fire stick itself functions well in getting programs for me however the remote is useless.  It has a range of about 4 feet and I have also tried other remotes provided by Amazon as a replacement and they perform the same.  This leaves me believing the receiver/transmitter in the Firestick is not working well except for the fact that my Visio TV remote works beautifully past ten feet doing all of the functions of the Amazon remotes just using different buttons.  I think Amazon needs to talk with the Visio engineers.  Also wish they would have a easy video casting/fling built inUpdate on problem- It did turn out to be a defective Fire Stick.  The response from Amazon was excellent, all items were shipped free and quickly..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "JB Palkki"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Everything it promess delivers", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Juan Alvarez"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I was always curious about the Amazon Fire stick.  I wanted to know if I could replace my regular TV with this nifty device.  I was able to stream my Netflix and HBO Go accounts.  I was also able to add some internet channels that I regularly watch.  The only draw back is that it is dependent on your internet connection.  If your internet connection is less than desirable, you will have some buffering issues.  Other than that, it works well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jordan Lovelace"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Nice product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Manuel"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I wanted this to work so badly.
