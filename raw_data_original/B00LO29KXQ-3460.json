I wanted to get a Roku box for a long time, but couldn't justify the high price. So when Amazon introduced this product I jumped on it.I've had the product for well over 5 months. I keep using it more and more over the Xbox and PS3 for streaming services. I don't have to turn on any devices or do anything special. All I need to do is change inputs on my tv and the Fire TV stick will fire right up.I love how I can install KODI onto the device, which adds a whole new dimension to the experience.In regards to streaming quality, it is fast and great. Videos streamed from Amazon and Netflix are at 1080p automatically when the applications are launched. There is no slow build up of 480 to 720 to 1080p like on my PS3.All in all, a wonderful product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisa Yang"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Netflix, Prime right at our fingertips, and absolutely no more infomercials", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susan H.
