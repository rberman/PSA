Between those three we have no need for cable tv anymore and we're free of that hassle. I'll be ordering 2 more units for the bedrooms asap.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

While the device itself is pretty cool, by far, the best part about it is the Flex app which upon further investigation I realized that I could sync all of the computers in my house through this service and not only be able to view all of my movies, music and pictures on my TV through the Fire TV but all the computers can use everyone else's content streaming across the network. Overall I am very happy with the Amazon Fire TV!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Bauer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Set up was easy and movies load immediately.

Need more apps and quality ones. I find you tube search on Fire TV no where nearwhat i have on my computer. Am I crazy? Need to have a more open relationship with other companies.All that said, I cannot wait for my wife to go to bed so I have full control.

You just plug it in and it's ready to go.  I start off by installing several pieces of software on it (netflix, hulu, etc.) and purchasing some new software for it (plex, some games).  It also showed me software I had previously purchased through the Amazon Android Market that I could download and install on it as well which I did.Everything seemed to be working o.k. until I went to view the free videos for Amazon Prime Members.  Amazon has mixed the free and paid content together so you have to dig hard to find free content but I couldn't find any.  I did a quick internet search and called amazon support.  Apparently, the free TV/Movies are only available to the Main Prime Holder and not their Guest.  Although I didn't want to manage this under my wife's account I figured I would change the device over to her account only it wipes all the content I've purchased already off it so I would only have access to things purchased under her amazon login and not my own.  Essentially this device is a Android Device like your phone, both my wife and I have separate Android phone and separate software we've purchased in the Amazon Android Market.  If I move it to her account I will have to manage the device I purchased for my office under her account to receive video's and repurchase any software I had already purchased and repurchase it under her account.  Amazon has no way for Spouses to Share the Primes Video services without loosing purchased content.Get it together Amazon.  I have a Roku that Plays my Netflix, Hulu, Plex, and Amazon Prime Content under my wifes login all while not having the box tied to one spouses account.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "14/25", "author": "Ray DuBose"}]
