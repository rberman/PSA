[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This has been a lot of fun.  Set up was really easy and only took minutes.  I am not a very technical person, but I was able to set up without any help. The program basically guides you through setup.Before I purchased my Fire TV Stick I had to hook my Kindle to our TV in order to  watch Netflix and Amazon Prime.  That meant that if my daughter wanted to watch a movie I could not use my Kindle.  I also had to navigate pauses and stops... through the Kindle. The Fire Stick comes with a remote, so I can pause without leaving my seat.Now it is so easy for the whole family to use it.  I also love streaming my favorite radio station through our Bose TV sound system.  I highly recommend this.  It is well worth the money if you are in the situation I was in.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "lettie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far so good!

My internet is perfect on all devices EXCEPT the fire stick. It never seems to hold connection long enough to do anything, and when it does it buffers everything minute or so.

I know there are other similar devices, but this animal can hunt. I couldn't give it 5 stars because 1) it needs a firmware update to accept Bluetooth headphones like the FireBox, 2) I was excited to use the mirroring option but it is quirky. Very difficult to connect and stay connected.
