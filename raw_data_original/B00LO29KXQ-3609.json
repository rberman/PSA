I already have Amazon Prime and a friend of mind knew I was saving up for a Smart TV. She told me she purchased the Fire TV Stick and now she wishes she never paid so much money for her Smart TV because with the Fire TV Stick  can convert a basic HDTV Flat Screen into a Smart TV! She saved me so much money and I am so glad I purchased it. It was easy to set up and I am able to listen to music and watch movies! It has frozen up on occasion so do not hit the buttons too fast. All you have to do is switch back to your TV and wait about 10 secs. It will correct itself. But besides that, I am completely satisfied.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A. Y.
