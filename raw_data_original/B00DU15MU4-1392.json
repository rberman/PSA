It was a Xmas present so I obviously did no research beforehand.  It streams quickly and the picture quality is top notch.  I love being able to watch media on so many available sites that it offers.  My only complaint is that the remote is a bit touchy.  When I click left or right to scroll through movie selections, sometimes it skips over a couple of movies and then I have to scroll back.  You really have to give it a light touch.  Other than that, I am a very happy camper.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Stephen Gradin"}]
