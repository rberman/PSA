Growing up with TVs in every room of the house, our family was definitely addicted to the tube.When I got cable, I found I would mindlessly watch shows and fell into the addictive pattern once again. Plus I did not like the exorbitant cable and satellite TV rates - pay through the nose and not even get what you want a la carte - crazy! I felt like a chump. So I decided to get rid of it, and try streaming. There are a lot of streaming arrangements out there to choose from. I like Youtube, so I wanted access to that.I first tried the Western Digital box and  a Netflix subscription. Hey, cheap! Gahhh. The WD box is pretty brain dead. The settings and applications are so rudimentary I was insulted. Are we going back to the dark ages of user interface? The Youtube app was unusable. Then I hooked up to Netflix - talk about brain dead. Settings? What settings? And the basic monthly fee didn't get you much, in my opinion. Not ideal. Usable, yes. But not great.When Amazon Fire TV came out I took a look at it. Should I get it? I needed a box for a different TV and didn't want to get WD again. I was not using my Netflix at all. I always like and admire Amazon products and services. Okay, let's give it a shot. I got it and hooked it up to the TV in mind and started it up. Very nice interface. I love the little remote control and the voice search always understands me - just as advertised! The selection of Prime content is similar to Netflix basic content. (I did not do a show-by-show analysis.) I added a bunch of shows and movies to my Watchlist and was pretty pleased overall. I went ahead and cancelled the unused Netflix account.As with the Kindle, I like having everything tied to my Amazon account. Easier to manage. The \"rent\" vs \"buy\" options for purchasing movies and TV episodes is straightforward. The speed of the streaming is instant and the quality is excellent. With our household FIOS account, we can stream with the Fire TV while surfing the web on multiple gadgets with no issues. My only beef is that the interface with Youtube is still not good - it is not fully integrated into the interface and seems like it was a jerry-rigged add-on.All-in-all I'm very pleased with the Fire TV and the streaming service.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "MajorDudette"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Cannot add much more to what has already been said.
