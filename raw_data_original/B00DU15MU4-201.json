[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "It works as discribed. No problem installing, just plug it in and get your passwords out, follow instructions on screen. I can only get 3g at home but movies play okay. I've had this for a year or more now.  But truthfully, I find myself going back to Netflix more often than not (because I don't have the dissapointment of finding a good show, then finding out it costs extra).  The real drag is that almost all good movies on Prime are charged extra for.  Besides, you must open each one to find that out. I pay enough without that agrivation. I wish Amazon would add a few more things that are free to prime members. No use to search, you'll find the better shows cost extra.

My husband has developed a serious addiction to watching prime videos, and now he isn't limited to only watching on his kindle fire! We have found this to be an absolute perfect addition to our collection of devices. My husband loves the voice search feature and I've found it to be pretty useful as well.My favorite part about it was that there was essentially no set up required. It was already connected to and logged into my account.We always get great picture quality, and while I'm sure part of that is due to the device, I believe it has a bit more to do with having a good internet connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Freya \"She not busy being born is busy dying.\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is an amazing device that turned my living room tv into a place everyone wanted to be. i can watch tv shows that i misses or play very good racing or fps games. the only down-side is the number of games on this, but other than that this device is wonderful! :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Maria E."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this as a gift for my parents who spend way too much on cable tv and never have anything to watch.
