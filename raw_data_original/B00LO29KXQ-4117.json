[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Not sure if its my Wifi connection or the stick but im having problems with the picture quality and the signal being dropped. Netflix is a problem as well as Plex and Vevo. It's a shame too because i love the Stick's interface and ease of slecting apps and media. Love the remote as well. Id use the stick more if it werent for the Wifi problem. For now I've gone back to watching netflix through my blu-ray player.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Norm in NY \"N.W.E\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great for TV shows, movies, games and photos!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisa D.
