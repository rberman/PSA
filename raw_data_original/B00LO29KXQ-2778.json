[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I bought this for my disabled wife so she could watch movies on Prime/Netflix in her bedroom where she is at %99 of the time and not by choice. I read up on all devices like this that do pretty much the same thing and chose the Fire Stick due to my then high respect of Amazon products. I have it hooked up using only the provided cables/plug etc. but 99 out of 100 times when she tries to start a movie it gives her the blue screen that more less states your setup does not pass the copy protect system check and she is unable to watch anything she has to wait until I can assist her by ower cycling everything which again this was bought for a disabled person. My question is will there be any kind of patch or update to fix this? if not bad as I hate to I will have to trash it and by a different streaming device. Any info or suggestions greatly appreciated", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mindy Ford"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like it, but I wish u would have less pay for view.
