[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "First, item was supposed to arrive on a Wednesday and date kept getting pushed back u til it finally arrived on Saturday. Despite title saying newest model I still had to download the latest software as it was not up to date. Then the box would not remember my wifi information and kept dropping the signal. If you have many wifi devices and things like Bose with wireless speakers this just gets too much interference and doesn't work so we returned it. I gave it a good effort however but just couldn't get t to work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Alesha M.

The whole point for me was to get Apple TV so I could cancel cable and save $70/month. Everything eventually comes online and with Apple airplay its easy to watch stuff online from my macbook on my flatscreen, but still; the apps should be open to anyone with or without a cable subscription.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ssavory"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product.

Streaming through Airplay was as seemless as a press of a button on the touchscreen. Very useful for watching high definition movies and listening to music from the iPad or iPhone.
