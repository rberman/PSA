[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I purchased this device the second day after it was announced, which means I got the device for twenty dollars. However, I would have gladly paid the full price for this device. At $20, it was a no-brainer. At $39, it's just as much of a value for what you're getting. I originally planned on using this device as my secondary device for my bedroom, but decided to move it to the living room once I saw what it offered over my Apple TV. The Apple TV is happy in my bedroom while the Fire TV Stick has center stage in the living room.Content:The Amazon Fire TV Stick gives you the ability to stream from everyone else that the other big guys like the Ruku and Apple TV allow you to, minus HBO Go. Amazon has stated that they are working on getting a version of HBO Go for their Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, but until then, you're essentially limited to mirroring from your Kindle Fire HD or HDX. That is, if you even own a Kindle Fire. This is not really a problem for me since I do own a Kindle Fire HDX, but a native app is certainly a better alternative and one that I greatly look forward to. Hurry up Amazon! We're waiting! The fact that I can get Plex for my Fire TV Stick is what made me decide to keep this in the living room and relocate the Apple TV instead. I LOVE me some Plex.Speed:There's no two ways about it; the Fire TV Stick isn't quite as powerful as the Fire TV set top box. But considering the price gap, I'm totally fine with a little bit more latency when navigating menus. There isn't any massive delay, but there is a minor stutter here and there as you navigate the home screen, especially if you have applications or content running in the background. But again, considering the price and what it offers, I'm fine with the slight hiccup every now and then. When compared to the Apple TV (second gen), it is considerably faster both loading content and navigating menus. I have never used the third gen Apple TV, so I cannot make any comparison there.Applications:Although you have the ability to run games on the Fire TV Stick, I would not recommend buying it if you plan to use it mainly for games. For the odd game here or there, it's fine, but don't expect insane performance from this thing. If you're looking for something more gaming-centric, I recommend the Fire TV set top box rather than the Stick. However, if you plan to use this for the general Netflix, Amazon Prime, Amazon Music, Hulu, Crackle, etc. etc., then you're better off with this instead of the Fire TV. The price difference is great enough to tolerate the minor software hiccup here and there, and the app selection is the very same (except for the games that it can run).Navigation:Short and sweet, you can use the remote, which is fine, but I recommend getting the Fire TV App if you have Android, a Fire phone, or a Kindle Fire. This will allow you to search for content via voice (though you will be limited to searching for apps that you have and apps in the store, and content from Amazon only, not, say, searching for content from Netflix via voice). It will also allow you to use a full keyboard, rather than the slow, tedious method of clicking around to each letter via the remote. There is currently no iOS app, but Amazon promises that there is one on the way.All in all I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase, especially since I got it for just $19 during the promotional introductory price. But, even at the full price, it's totally worth it. I will say that many retailers are having sales on the Fire TV Stick. You may be able to get it cheaper than you can via Amazon, so make sure you do your research first.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Andrew King"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Got this because it had flixster", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David B.

The round thing at the top of the remote is two wheels which are used to enter the password. Mine didn't work and I had to call customer service. The first rep spoke English quite well. She forwarded me to the Fire services. I spent five miserable minutes on hold while subjected to a scratchy tape of pounding music before the call was terminated. I called back and got a rep who barely spoke English and was difficult to understand, probably from India. She passed me off to another rep, so I was again subjected to the miserable \"music\" for 9 minutes. I got a rep who spoke English and she sent me back into the queue for the Fire technician. Another five minutes of torture on hold. He reset the remote and stayed on the line until I got connected.  Then it played a video which included instructions it would have been nice to have BEFORE attempting set up. After all the unnecessary aggravation, it seems to be working nicely. Amazon gets zero stars for outsourcing jobs to India.P.S. After using it a few days, I am happy with it. It is nice to not have to hook up my Kindle to the tv and to have a remote for navigating. The screen savers are lovely.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Sockosim \"Socko\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It arrives with full access turned on to photos inside account holders Amazon Cloud Drive.  If anyone takes it during transit or at delivery, they will be able to see your private images.  It does not need to be validated with a password, it is already enabled and ready to use by anyone who plugs it into an HDMI port.This is simply a security issue that shouldn't exit.Also, there is NO way to remove the associated account holders Amazon Cloud Drive so anyone with access to the TV will have access to all your photos that are backed up to AMZ Cloud Drive.  For those who may take reminder images of gift ideas, etc. this is not idea.  One also may not want to share their personal images and document scans with the maintenance person or the housekeeper.  If you use Amazon Cloud Drive, your photos will be always shared with this device unless they fix this.As far as a device, it's flaky, often freezing, if only powered from the TV's USB.  The FireTV Stick may require the included AC adapter (and probably an additional extension cord) with some TV's although I had no problem with a Chromecast while it was powered by the same TV.If the forced sharing of an Amazon Cloud drive is not an issue, then overall it's a reasonable and inexpensive way to get Amazon Prime content to a TV.  It's not as polished or solid as an Apple TV, nor does it cost as much. It also works well as a stand-alone device unlike a Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "D.
