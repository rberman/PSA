[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the Amazon Fire Stick.  It was super simple to install and gave me immediate access to all sorts of streaming apps.  I haven't been able to figure out how to make sure my kids don't accidentally make purchases while looking for movies to watch, but that hasn't seemed to be an issue as of yet.  But I would still definitely recommend this to anyone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lora"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works very well.

Bought to replace a secondary cable box that was costing me $10 monthly. Very responsive with very little lag on most applications I have installed.

However when I moved it away from the modem (20 feet), the signal dropped. I have high speed FIOS and this shouldn't happen. The door to the other was open and it had a difficult time buffering. I was disappointed because I was thinking of getting another stick for the other room.  Now, I won't need to do this. I have to keep it near the modem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "n.e."}]
