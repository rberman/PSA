We've always used Roku, but decided to try this because of the price. In the beginning, I was concerned because it kept losing the wifi signal, but that seems to have corrected itself. It gets all the apps that my family uses to stream, which some other streaming sticks do not.  I'm really happy that I can now get HBO Now on it.  We actually plan on buying more as soon as we upgrade our other televisions to ones that it's compatible with. This really is a great device - especially for the price!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeffrey & Elizabeth Demofonte"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the fire stick!

It was easy to install and connect to my computer network. The biggest reason I wanted the Fire Stick was to access Netflix, which I can now do easily. In addition, the Fire Stick allows me to watch the movies that I bought for my Kindle on the TV.

I waited a long time to use it because I was moving and didn't want to have to go through the hassle of setting it up multiple times. Boy was I wrong this is so simple to set up that we take it when we go on trips and stay in hotels with Wifi. We actually have something decent to watch rather than just the basic channels that the hotel has to offer. I thought the remote would be complicated to use but even that is fairly simple and doesn't take long to navigate for typing. If I would ask for one improvement it would be that the remote be backlit so when we are watching tv in bed at night we can see to turn it off or change program. We use our phones as flashlights.
