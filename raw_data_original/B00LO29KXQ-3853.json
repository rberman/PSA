[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it! I think it is the best thing I have ever had! I quit my cable...I still have the very basics of it, but teh Amazon Fire TV stick is just so freaking awesome easier to install than the roku.. The roku ended up not working for me, therefore I just returned it and got the Amazon fire TV stick. I am just so amazed by it. It took me less than five minutes to install. I have hulu andnetflix and what is great is the learning stuff on it as well. I love it!Thank you so much!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ariana matos"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works good and best option for the money by far.

After I received the package, I didn't open it immediately because I was worried I might not be able to set it up without assistance.  I finally told myself to just to give it a try.  My worries were completely unfounded.  Set-up was so simple, it surprised me.  I have not yet explored all of its capabilities but I am already watching TV shows and movies without difficulty.  Now, I am seriously thinking about telling my cable company to take a hike.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gwenshuman"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product.  Easy set up right out of the box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jon pizor"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The content of the stick was great. Lots to choose from, many services in one location.However... This thing is slow and full of bugs.Despite having excellent connectivity and full wifi bars, it operated like 90s computer. It often showed error messages and buffered and loaded forever. The apps, like Netflix and YouTube are especially slow and often just plain don't work. After speaking 4 times with Amazon reps, we were told this was all due to the weak processor on the stick. We have decided to return the stick and let Amazon have the chance to redeem itself by purchasing the Fire TV.Hopefully, there will be no issues with it. Or maybe we are just used to the instantaneous functions of all of our Apple Products.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kara Sylvester \"Lactess\""}]
