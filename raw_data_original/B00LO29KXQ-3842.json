[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought this for my dad's birthday. Decided to open it to set it up for him. Updated and put some apps on it I knew he'd use like Netflix and Flixster. Setup is easy. Register with ur Amazon account and boom...any apps or music you have in the cloud are accessible on the fire tv.  Played around with it for a bit and decided to look online and see what else it could do. Found info about sideloading apps with an adb connection. Found later that a much much easier way is to download the Apps to Fire app from Google play store. Any app on your phone you can send to your fire tv with a simple tap. Now not all apps will be compatible. You'll just have to try em out and see. One cool trick is sending your settings apk (app) file to the fire tv. Launch it and you can turn on the Bluetooth setting and pair some Bluetooth headphones to it. Pretty neat. I also installed Kodi (XBMC) on it and I love it. You can find instructions on how to do that online easily. Needless to say I liked the fire tv stick so much I just kept it for myself and ordered another one for my dad. He likes it as well. Great buy and highly recommended", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William E. Sells III"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "False advertising! They advertise like it's just the little stick and it's completely wireless but it's not. You have to keep it plugged in. Also, it skips constantly and freezes. I love Amazon but this product is NOT up to par. I upgraded my internet to the highest level thinking that would help and it did not. The device just doesn't work 100%. It's awful. Just splurge and buy the Apple TV. It's worth it. It's what I'm doing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Lena Mary Amato"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jay  Swanson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very satisfied!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "koa"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Thought that this would be a great product from Amazon but turned out total disappointment.

(Highest plan with the most GB or MLPS) Since Wifi only, it works great in the same room as router, but farther you get, the more buffering and loss of HD you get. Got the Fire TV and hard wired the Internet and had a quality hdmi cable hook up and love it much more! Spend a little extra and get the box!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "K.
