It was easy to install, but, like all things, it's easier if your are computer savvy.  For example, it lists three steps durng installation.  One of which is \"connect to internet.\"  I thought it meant to my internet server, Cox, but, discovered it meant to connect to my WIFI.  Luckily I had installed WIFI for my Kindle.  Like everything today, it's easier if a person is computer savvy.One other thing I noticed is that, if you click on a movie, it comes on immediately.  There is no info about whether or not a cost is involved; i.e., when I go to a movie on my Kindle, it lists an amount if a cost is involved.Anyway, I'm still learning and would appreciate more info as to how the Fire Stick works.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Nanette Ouellet"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got it for my mom, she doesn't have a smart TV so I thought this would be perfect for her, she loves her old cowboy movies, she loves John Wayne so this was perfect. And it works great, easy setup. Next I think I'll get the remote with voice control... At least I think it works with it. Definitely recommend it.
