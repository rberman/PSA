We also have Prime which is perfect because we don't have a lot of extra unused stuff like others have stated.  The menu and playing is very much like Roku but just seems to be better, the roku has a few extra steps to get apps to change apps. Love how to find other apps and how easy it is to get the apps. We are using the remote that it came with, however we did download the remote app on our android. And what a great remote that is, way easy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dan kane"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great for prime, netflix and hulu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "abraham hunt"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Makes a TV with an hdmi connection an Amazing- Amazon Experience.

This device hooks up straight to an HDMI port and has a micro usb cable for power. I tested on my living room TV with the usb port on the TV for power - it seems to work fine, but the TV this device will be used on doesn't have a usb port, so I'm using the recommend external power plug-in.Pros:-Fast-Great Looking UI-Dual  channel WiFiCons:-Minor Bugs-No IR (for universal remote control)-No EthernetUsing the device for a little time now, I have enjoyed the UI of the the Fire Stick main page and also the UI in the few apps that I have time to use(Amazon Prime, Watch ESPN, PLEX). The Fire Stick also seems extremely faster than other streaming devices that I have used (Roku 3, Apple TV, Chromecast). I had no issues with finding my local wifi, and have not had any issues with dropping connection or any buffering of sorts.The Fire Stick a few times have locked up in a app, but usually hitting the home button on the remote has resolved most issues. Once in the approximately 2 weeks of use, I had to reset the device because it was unresponsive.UPDDATE:(12/8/14) Changing from 4 to 3 stars (I would probably give it 3.5 if I could) After having the Fire Stick a little longer, I still enjoy the speed and the UI, but the crashes in app and have lost wifi connection where it doesn't even find my home network and I have to manual reset the device to make it functional. For the $19 pre-sale price its still a great device with hopefully updates with App crashes. But in the same price range -  I like a Roku Stick over this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "C.Z."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great little streaming stick. I have chrome cast, playstation, and smart tv. It is fun to compare the technologies. The quality of the stream and the ease of setup are great. I just use the usb port on tv to power it and it runs fine(it recommends a wall wart usb socket which it comes with for always on, updates, and caching of video). I like it over the chromecast for the hard remote and the netflix android app kept having issues.Negative on this and the smart tv app is make sure to give it time to connect before opening netflix or you will be prompted to type in username and password again! grr.The battery case to the remote could be easier to remove, right now it's a hair too much.I do not like the android fire tv remote app! they have a weird touchpad that is not intuitive.
