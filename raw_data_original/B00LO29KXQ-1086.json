Setup was easy.  I was not able to properly sign in to my account on the native You Tube App.  I could only view the standard video suggestions. Sign in just kept asking me to sync with my device and never got to the sign in process for my You Tube account. I downloaded One Tube and was able to sign in and get all my subscriptions and favorites. Netflix worked great as well as Prime Videos and songs.  I will use it at home on my smart TV as it does not have many of the apps installed on the Fire TV stick. Missed the one day sale, but it is still a good value.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Limitby9"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Crystal"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy with this product!

The image quality is far more superior than the Apps that come with my smart tv. I have Netflix on my smart TV app but I have decided to watch Netflix through Amazon fire stick because of the crisp, clear image quality. It is also very simple to operate. I had no trouble figuring out the remote or the registration process. I did have some trouble jamming in to firestick into my tv's HDMI port. It definitely took some muscle to get it in. Otherwise, it is an over all very good buy.
