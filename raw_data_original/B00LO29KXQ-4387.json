[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Last year, I bought a small \"smart\" TV for my kitchen that allowed me to use my Amazon Prime account to watch free movies and TV shows. When they came out with the Fire stick, I was excited because I would now be able to get all this on the other larger TVs in the house. I LOVE LOVE IT! It was very easy to initially set up and I have had no problems using it. I have nothing bad to say about it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CB02864"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "IT'S GREAT FOR TV OR MOVIES AND WORKS SUPER EVERY ONE SHOULD GET ONE!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Judy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely the best item ever purchased by our family. Instead of spending money (lots of money) at the show, we can now view both new and older movies for free, with the Amazon Prime membership.
