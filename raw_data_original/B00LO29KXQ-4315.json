This thing is pretty buggy (shows will stutter at the start), and almost always freeze around 80% of the way through on netflix and then gets stuck loading at 25%.  Sometimes I get random reboots.  The smartphone remote app is a completely horrible. Just a frustrating, terrible un-intuitive experience.  In one level of the UI, you swipe the phone screen a certain direction, and the items on the tv screen move in the same direction.  Go a level deeper (by 'clicking' or entering a menu), and suddenly the swipes move things the OPPOSITE direction!  What the heck??  The voice search is a neat feature, but is not designed well (nothing tells you to keep holding down to keep listening).  We lost the included remote for a week and completely quit using the Fire TV stick just because the smartphone remote is so terrible.On the positive side, the interface is decent, and the included remote is easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Craig H"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great addition!
