[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was looking at the Roku 3, but decided on Apple based on reviews and particular purpose.  I mainly play shows off Youtube and was looking for an alternative to HDMI off of iPad.  This did the trick, and with the Remote app I removed the frustration of single type entries for particular shows.  I also like how it moves to the next sequential show, where Youtube doesn't always have them in order.  Very pleased.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I finally broke down and decided to try it out now that the price dropped to $69. I have been really happy with my Roku 1 and have no complaints about it. I just wanted to see what the Apple TV could offer in comparison. I don't shop the iTunes store much so the aspect of my library being available on the TV is cool but not a game changer for me. The thing I was most interested in was the Airplay and mirroring feature from my iPhone.I received my Apple TV on Saturday along with a 3' Amazonbasics HDMI (shameless plug for these awesomely affordable cords). I connected my unit via Ethernet (nice option) and was up and running in no time. I tested out the Netflix and Hulu Plus apps to compare to Roku. Nothing spectacular and I have to say I prefer the Roku remote. Apple TV does not have the Amazon instant video app so I connected via Airplay and played it from my phone. Flawless! It also doesn't have a Plex app. No problem. Airplay! I then mirrored a movie from Hoopla and voila! All to say for what the Apple TV lacks in apps, it makes up for by offering Airplay (if you have an Apple product). I'm still not sure that I needed it because I have a Roku that offers a lot of diversity but the Apple TV is just a little more fun to play with.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "jughead56"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great gadget with option to simulcast video from iPhone to TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G.

I do have all Apple products so it should run smoothly, but instead it it connects for a few then just seems to lose connection.
