[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far I'm happy with the Amazon Fire TV Stick. It basically turns your TV into a Smart TV with apps which is what I wanted. It's very easy to set up and has a bunch of neat features. The only issue I had with this is that it sometimes likes to lag/freeze, which sucks because I really want to like this! I mean I do, but that's just really annoying. If you let it \"fall asleep\" where I guess a screen saver comes on, sometimes it doesn't like to wake back up right away (but who does right?) and will take you a few minutes to get it to do anything. One time, I even had to unplug it and replug it back in just so it'd start responding. Randomly it'll just start lagging really bad with a delay while browsing through the main screens. It's not a internet connection issue because it's literally right next to the WiFi router. I don't know if I happened to get a 'bad' one or what, but other than that issue I really enjoy it. Maybe updates will fix this issue, so I'm not too worried about it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Carey H"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use.
