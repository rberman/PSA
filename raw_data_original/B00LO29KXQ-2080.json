I spent an hour to mirroring my Kindle Fire to my big screen HDTV, and it keeps saying the network issue and fails to connect. Finally, I could connect Kindle Fire to TV. It's not good for this function. Another issue, by fling my Kindle Fire to TV is only good for Amazon instant video, but for other apps, such as Youtube, I was not able to fling it. This is why I give 4-star review, as the mirror and fling functions are not good to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Eric"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great device, easy to use.
