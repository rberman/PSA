Though I like the Apple TV I think it could and SHOULD be better. For sample, there needs to be more programs available for FREE. I don't have cable TV and most of what is offered requires a sign in and subscription type account. So we are left with a bunch of \"stations\" that are useless for us.Another thing that could be better is the rental price for movies through the apple account. With Red Boxes on every corner renting a movie for around $3-5 doesn't compare to the box $1 rentals. If there was a huge snow storm I could see taking advantage of the convince but for an every day thing we opt to use the Red box or AMAZON prime.Which brings me to my next subject...the Air Play feature. We use this a lot as I'm a prime member with AMAZON. There are some great programs and movie  to watch and free. Their rentals are also less expensive than the ones offered on Apple TV. I do run across issues when using the \"mirroring\" with the \"connection\" either caused by the Apple TV or my phone or my wifi connection. It's nearly imposable for me to figure out the cause of it. It was super stressful in the beginning but now we are just used to \"booting\" back up and the kids realize that it WILL come back on.Overall the Apple TV is pretty cool but needs to offer more options to make me a true lover of it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ali in Crazyland"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great device for internet media connectivity.

I love be able to send things from my iPhone directly to my tv", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "chris"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "If you're an Apple user, then the apple TV is great. The box connects to your TV with an HDMI cable and also connects to a wall outlet for power. You can wirelessly stream any content on your tablet, phone, or laptop (provided you have a mid-2011 or newer macbook) straight to your TV. You can even use Airplay to turn your television into a wireless second monitor for your laptop. Music, movies and apps all connect very quickly and respond with little to no lag. If you have existing cable subscriptions you can type in your account information to activate those channels directly on the TV. I do not have cable, but I have HBO NOW and Netflix subscriptions and it's nice to be able to watch Thrones and Rome without having to stream from my iPad.PROS:- Sylish, compact Apple design- Excellent wireless functionality expands the capabilities of Apple devices- Intuitive interfaceCONS:- Very limited free TV content if you do not have a cable subscription (though all the device connectivity functionality is free of course)- The only means of controlling some aspects of Apple TV UI, as far as I can tell, is the apple remote. It takes a little time to type out your usernames, emails and passwords using the remote but at least you only have to do it once.- My largest reservation: no Bluetooth connectivity. If you're streaming content from your iPad to your TV, you cannot simultaneously stream audio to Bluetooth speakers. This really isn't a problem if your television has good speakers or if you a good set hard-wired, but my TV is a monitor and its speakers are horrible. I have to connect a separate pair of desktop speakers to my monitor to get decent sound quality instead of just using my Big Jambox.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Johnny Devil"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works for me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Thurman Brown"}]
