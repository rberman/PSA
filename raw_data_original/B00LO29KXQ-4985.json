In fact, the only downside we've found after a week or so is that other throughputs on our Panasonic Viera TV sporadically drop to black and white, and even then a simple unplug/re-plug cycle sets things right.Mind you, we have Amazon Prime, and that makes a lot of the content free to view.

No one seems to have reported this problem so here goes.Netflix video and audio stutters right from the get go and was unusable. The mobile app remote did not see the FireTV stick either. Wasn't able to fix it after testing it with different routers, and different internet connections.The main problem seems to be related to the remote app being stuck in some weird state and a simple reset of the phone fixed it. I am on a Samsung S3 android.Other than that, this is a decently valued device other than:1) The initial setup is HORRIBLE... how do they expect people to type in a long password for the WIFI with a keyboard layout like that. Forgot exactly how chromecast worked but their approach was much easier with connecting to the phone first and let users TYPE the password in.2) That ridiculous setup video you are forced to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "vince lau"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Fire TV stick works as anticipated.
