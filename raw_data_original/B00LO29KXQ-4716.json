[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love the concept of the Fire Stick. I had a Google Chromecast and never opened it because I wanted a \"real\" remote and I was waiting to buy a new LED tv (I was robbed months before and pulled out the old tube tv's). At Christmas I got a couple of new tv's and bought several Fire Stick's. I loved the stick the 1st 2 weeks. Then I came home to: \"Internet Connection Lost\". Then Home page not available... go to Network Settings. Now, 4 weeks later, it does one or the other EVERY SINGLE NIGHT when I turn it on! Sometimes both alternatively. It is so frustrating. I gave these out as Christmas presents. Kept 3 for myself and am currently using 2 of them in rooms side by side. They're never dysfunctionin at the same time, so it's NOT the internet. But, once it's up and going it is great. Giving It a 4 on the small chance my room is too far from the router. My son has only had problems twice since Christmas.Side note...for some reason, the remote is a *bleep* to open!P.S. An hour after this review...a new glitch. Don't know for sure if it was a Netflix issue or Fire Stick. But when I went to a 2nd episode of Bones, it was a tiny square up in the corner like PIP and the rest of the tv black. Tried American Dad and Family Guy...same deal. I've had Netflix for years and this has never happened on the wii, wii u, Blu ray, phone, laptop or Kindle so I'm leading toward it being a \"STICK GLITCH\".", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

Why I rate it one star is that the Stick is unreliable.  I get the message \"We are unable to connect to Amazon services.  Please check your Internet connection or try again later.\"  I select \"Go To Network Settings\" and \"Rescan for available Wi-Fi networks,\" which is followed by not finding any networks.  I'm writing and submitting this review using the Wi-Fi connection the Stick can't find.  At this point, the Stick is still glitchy.  Hopefully Amazon will fix the quirks for the next gen, but this version doesn't seem quite ready for distribution.  I don't have TV reception, so if it worked, it'd be 5 stars great simply for streaming Amazon content.

I have never had a problem, netflix works, hulu plus, you-tube, amazon prime, disney, games, and well everything. Not bad we loved it so much we had to order another for my son, so we ordered it from Staples as the one on here is out of stock until Mid February and we've been using it since before the new year and it works amazingly.
