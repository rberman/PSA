Should be able to shortcut any app (xbmc, Kodi, etc..) to the home screen. Plus the remote can be super glitchy!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chunk"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I like this device.  Compared to the Chromecast it is superior with a more varied array of options.  My biggest gripe so far is the ability to cast from Windows 8.1.  Although Windows finds the device and FireTV stick recognizes the computer the screen sharing never commences.  This is disappointing.  I need to work on it more.  Perhaps Window 10 will help to solve the problem.  I am comparing the device with Apple TV which works well in an apple environment.  The fact that the FireTVStick allows the download of apps provides great flexibility.  Others need to enable the same.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gingerbreadman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My grandchildren love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brenda Greer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Haven't used it much yet, but so far I am very pleased.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "P.
