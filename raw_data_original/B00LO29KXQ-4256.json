It is easy to use, easy to figure out how to hook up.  One of our older BluRay players would not stream Amazon prime movies so this was the perfect match.  It took a lot longer to arrive after ordering, which surprised me, and I did not receive good communication during this time.  I have never had that experience before.  I usually receive Prime orders in 2 days.
