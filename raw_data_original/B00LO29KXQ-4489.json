The one thing that my husband and I felt was and is misleading is the stick just going into the back of your TV..it does, but the USB port does not have enough power to power teh stick so it has to be powered as well...all cables included, its just the advert for this stick shows NONE of this...it shows a stick going into the TV and a remote...A great product, but know its more than just sticking a stick into your USB port.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BB"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I also have a Fire TV in my living room so I was not surprised with the ease of set up for the Fire Stick. It is easy to use and because I am a Prime Member there is an enormous amount of choices. My only complaint is that every 10 to 40 seconds it stops for a millisecond and then continues. I have full wifi signal so it isn't that. I have tried unplugging and then putting it in another hdmi port but that didn't help. Other than that it is fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Reading Queen"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works really well.The new Kindle Fire HDX left out a micro HDMI conenction, forcing you to stream TO the Kindle and then FROM the Kindl to the TV.Well, that does NOT work well in a lot of environments - esp. if the TV is in a hotel in a croweded RF spectrum.Pretty much kills it - I could get the Kindle Fire HDX to stream, sometimes, at home - but not well. Testing with a Windows 8.1 notebook had similar results.So I tried the stick - it only needs to stream TO the stick, and then it's right into the TV.Voila' - works like a charm.The menus are OK - they are intelligible - but could be improved.It's a very nice device.  If you like streaming Amazon movies I would say this is the way to go.  Nicely done, Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "firewallbill \"firewallbill\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "nice", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jung Keun Park"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install and easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven Harvey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Simple setup. its nice to watch Prime offerings on the big screen.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "msvegasgal"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I like i have good entertainet in my house.
