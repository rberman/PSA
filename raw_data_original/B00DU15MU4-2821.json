Let's me use my prime subscription to it highest use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stuart Williams \"Stuart\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We own several streaming devices - Apple TV, the Roku Streaming Stick, and now, the Amazon Fire TV.  We bought the Amazon Fire TV because streaming our tablets (iPad and Kindle) to Apple TV and Roku wasn't exactly what we wanted.  Apple TV does do a good job with music, but so does Amazon Fire TV, especially if you use the Amazon Cloud.The Amazon Fire setup was very easy.  Take it out of the box, plug it in, and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure that your Amazon Fire TV and Kindle Fire HDX (if you have one) are on the same network so that you can mirror the table to the screen. If you're like us, and have 2 different networks, this can cause a little confusion at first.We like to display photos, play music, watch on-demand movies, or surf the web on a big screen using our tablets.  The Amazon Fire does all of this, and works very well with Kindle Fire HDX.  Imagine doing a group reading of a book displayed on a 50\" TV.Amazon Fire's voice search feature is phenomenal.  It beats scrolling through hundreds of movie titles.  If you have Amazon Prime, you already have access to thousands of on-demand movies and TV episodes.  We are currently working our way through several science fiction TV series, starting with Eureka, and plan to move on to Heroes, Alphas, V, and X-Files.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "BoundaryDweller"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I would give this Amazon Fire TV five stars. However, I feel it rates at only four stars. I really wanted to keep this, but returned it to the store.I am not giving a full detailed review. I am however going to say this:1. I really did like the device for the most part. Easy to set up and could start using it immediately,2. I loved the voice search feature.My two things I am not happy with and one really is a minor thing. The batteries. I could get around this by using a rechargable type of battery, but wish it came with a recharging type installed with a recharging cable of some sort.Now this is where my main issue comes. The content it comes with which when I found Prime on the Amazon Fire TV, I saw it is mostly pay for, even though I am a Prime member. I realize much of the content is newer, so wont be free yet. I understand this. However, Prime content or more of it should be free and easier to find and access. I could not find enough free content to justify keeping this.Yes I overall still like the product. I felt Amazon otherwise put out a good product. When I pay for Prime membership which content indeed should be free or well included, then by all means include it in the membership.I still love Amazon. I have a Kindle Paperwhite. I have the Amazon applications on my Android device.Please Amazon, include more content free in the membership price on the Kindle Fire TV.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "shari"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The voice actuated search mechanism is great!

Bad mistake the Fire sets up easy however that is the end of it the streaming speed is 4 min of entertainment 5 min of stream. We have 5 Kindles and love them, but Amazon needs to take this back to the drawing board.

I think that any Prime Member should have one in order to tap into all the great content available to Prime customers.
