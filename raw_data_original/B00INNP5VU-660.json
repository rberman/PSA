Wifi shows full signal strength, yet this stick has trouble streaming any content (even across my local network).  Takes forever to power up.  Slow to respond to remote control commands.

After a week the remote stopped working, I did the Tech. Support thing twice with no luck.  I Googled the issue and found better help on the Internet.  Now it works 60% of the time but I've lost count on how times I've opened it up and switched the batteries around.  Needless to say a big pain.  I will go to some other product after doing some research.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jim"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We are not really huge TV watchers in my family.  Outside of news and weather...we watch very little live TV.  I have just one or two channels that I usually keep on for background noise and to watch.  My son prefers to just watch something from Netflix or Hulu and my husband doesn't have any preference.  So to save our family over $80 per month I cancelled my cable TV.  I just have the high speed internet now and we are able to pick up a ton of channels for free. In fact I get all my favorite channels that I used to pay cable to have now for free.  We got the Roku because while we have Xbox in 2 bedrooms and the living room that we stream Netflix and Hulu through...I wanted something for the TV in my office.  I could not see paying $200 or more for an Xbox that was going to be used only for streaming.  I bought this Roku and have been very happy with it.  Not only did it save me the cost of another Xbox but also the $60 yearly gold membership required to stream on Xbox.  It took just seconds to plug into my TV and I was up and running.  I can watch Netflix, Hulu Plus plus other channels now just as easily as when I had cable. The little remote is great.  I am very happy with this product.  I hope they add more channels in the future. There were a few I was disappointed you could not get like the history channel but overall a great deal.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "N.

In particular there seems to be an issue with Netflix which failed to work a few times and take nearly 1 minute to load.  Also experienced significant lag when using the remote.Great concept but product clearly not ready for Prime Time unless my unit was faulty. Decided to return it and wait for a few months to see if Roku update software or even hardware to resolve problems.

I bought two of these.  It works great in my living room.  On my smaller TV it works great, but appears to be interfering with the antenna reception.
