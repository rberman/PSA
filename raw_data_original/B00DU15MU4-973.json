[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "The system was easy to hook up and get running with my HDMI cables and TV. Quality and variety seem to be pretty good for both movies and TV shows. We end up using t more for TV shows then we do movies as it appears the Prime movies don't update as often as NETFLIX or they are a large variety of \"B\" flicks.I also bought this to be able to play some games with my kids and family, not as a XBOX or PS3 replacement, but just a casual family game time and this was probably the least favorite part of the system. I tried to order a controller for the system which is $40 and it was going to take almost 2 months to receive it, also the variety of games available to play on the Fire TV was very limited or required a controller.The movies you could rent on the box were not any cheaper than Comcast on demand unless they were so old that Comcast didnt carry it anymore.Overall I think it is a good system if you have an Amazon Prime membership and want to catchup on your favorite TV shows you missed but I'm not sure I would use this as a cable or NETFLIX replacement. You can run NETFLIX on this but it requires a NETFLIX account.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R. V.

Firstly it gets stuck buffering and you have to back out, then reenter the item you had selected.  Next it only turns off after a time of no use.  This is okay, but it has to be on the home page.  One problem with that now is they added an ad banner at the top and now the device doesn't turn off even when sitting idle and your tv off.  You turn the tv back on and the screen saver is going.  Sometimes when watching a show it turns black and you have to fast forward to get it to go back to the show, especially happens when watching Hulu plus.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

I have to give it only four stars because it does not have access to as many sites as ROKU.  ACORN is one that should be included for fans of British and Australian productions.
