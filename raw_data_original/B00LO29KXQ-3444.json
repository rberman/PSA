We ended up buying it at Best Buy since it wasn't in stock through Amazon. We haven't had any issues with the Wi-Fi as others have reported. Netflix does freeze occasionally but we have Amazon Prime so we mostly stream Prime Videos. My only complaint is that I feel like browsing on the TV is pretty limited. I find it easier to look at the Prime video available online and then add it to my to-watch list.Aside from Prime Video - we love the Vevo app for watching videos. It's almost like MTV is back (like what we old folks remember from the 80s and 90s.) I love the photo slide show. I have my phone set up to upload all my pics to the Amazon Cloud and then I can set the tv to play a slide show of all my pics. And we also use the tv as a \"radio\" and stream Pandora. We've already gotten a lot of use out of the fire stick. It's pretty awesome.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J. Harding"}]
