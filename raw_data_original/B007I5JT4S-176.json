[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great product. I can now stream no line internet radio, as well as photos, I tunes music, etc. I especially like the screen saver which comes up on my TV after a few minutes if I don't touch the remote. Pictures are so clear, and the music is full fidelity!

It's a breeze to set up, just plug it in, put in your Wi-Fi password, and you're set to listen to music, watch movies and TV shows, and stream from your Apple device. HBO Go, Showtime Anytime, Netflix, Watch ESPN, Hulu Plus and more are offered. The remote is simple to use and the interface is very intuitive. Amazon Prime users will lament the fact that Apple TV does not support Amazon Instant Video, but that is really the only drawback.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ben B. \"History Buff\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just amazing!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Vic R."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great and there's a decent selection of channels although mostly just use NetFlix.  Amazon Instant Video support would be nice but I can access that through my old PS3 and their selection of videos available for free through Prime has never been stellar anyway.The Apple TV's interface is nice, AirPlay is great for playing music from my laptop through my home theater and streaming video from my iPhone works well too.  It's a nice piece of hardware.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brandon C.

Outstanding product with it's ease of setup and simplistic usability.  I highly recommend it as it doesn't come with all the nuances that a non-AppleTV does.  My 67 yr old mother set this up on her TV on her own.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anita"}]
