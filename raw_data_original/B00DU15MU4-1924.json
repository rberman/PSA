Also, my receiver was intermittently locking up and one of the Amazon Techs talked me through clearing the \"Cache\" and now it works PERFECTLY!!  This is worth knowing how to do!!The quality of the video and audio are extremely good and it is MUCH EASIER to navigate than Netflix is through my Blu-Ray!!Thanks again Amazon!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CoosawJack"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This i amazing...my kids and I love it.

Maybe I got an early on dud, but it was jumpy, and skipped/buffered on Netflix constantly.

I decided that I no longer wanted a cable bill and so I decided to try this out. I have had it for over 6 months now and have not looked back. I save over $100 a month not paying for cable and I just pay for internet. I pay for the prime membership and Hulu and I have everything I need to watch through that.The remote is amazing...you just hold the button and speak, and it finds exactly what you asked for.Highly recommend!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anastasia"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Microphone system works well, but always brings you to programs that you have to rent.
