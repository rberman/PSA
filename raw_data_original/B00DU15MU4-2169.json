This device turns your tv into an Android based smart tv.. Any app the doesn't come loaded you can \"side load\" most apps from your computer over your WiFi network..  I've installed Google chrome, HBOgo, Showtime anytime,  Max Go.. They all work as it should.. (Showtime you gotta install a rotation app tho)I even hooked up a wired XBox 360 controller and all games I have tried work great..  I have also hooked up a wireless keyboard/mouse combo to browse  the internet.. Very powerful device,  just could use a little more internal memory, but It's not an issue.. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a smart tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "kory kersy"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The fire tv equipment worked fine but Amazon prime is not all it states. Too many normal tv shows have to be paid for and not free such as Paw Patrol or any kids shows. The movies are very old movies to choose from. No recent ones. I should have done my research before buying. Just want to cut the cord but this doesn't help :(  Just my opinion so far but maybe after I research more I can upgrade it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "scarecrow"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I LOVE IT BUT COMCAST IS A THEIF THEY WONT LET ME HAVE LIFETIME OR A AND E ON IT.

FireTV is always on, it does go into sleep mode after extended time without it being used  - Clunky functionality when using Amazon instant video, this isn't just a FireTV problem but also a general Amazon problem. They do a poor job of distinguishing from PRIME and regular (purchasable) content. There is an option to setup a pin to avoid unwanted purchases.Overall I really like it and would purchase it again", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sniper1"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works hand in hand with our Kindles.

If you're looking for a television-connected device for IPTV via Netflix, Plex, etc., look no further.Let's break it down:The Good- Best hardware available for a streaming device- Bang for the buck; extremely cost effective compared to other solutions available in market- Better application selection than most streaming devices; plus it runs Plex beautifully- The remote's pretty solid and responsiveThe Bad- The software clearly still has some issues, and it lacks the polish that you'd see from an Apple product.- Buggy audio at times that requires a reboot- Only way of rebooting is to unplug the power, then plug it back in. Really? You couldn't add a reboot function to the system menu?- The gaming aspect of this seems quite aspirational/early adopter; I don't see much value here- No HBOGo; although it's coming soon, I find this to be a pretty big gap", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Joe D"}]
