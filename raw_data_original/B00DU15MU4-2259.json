I have been an Apple TV man since 2008, but I have decided that I just might never return to my Apple TV.  I have used/owned all 3 generations and have known them inside and out (unlocked my 1st generation for secret stuff. Shhhh!) and swore by them for years. I just received my amazon fire tv device this afternoon and plugged it up without a hitch. Voice command is a nice touch, but I was most impressed with the speed of the quad core processor. No more waiting for my videos to buffer, and this is especially important in my house where my wife, kids, and I are sometimes simultaneously streaming videos.  Final word: If you're just looking for a great device to stream both Netflix and Amazon Prime, then you've found the right streamer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Chris Lunsford"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got mine from an electronics store, because I didn't want to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Setup was a breeze. I don't have cable, so prior to this, I had to hook my laptop up to my TV to enjoy Prime and Netflix content on it. I'm also really pleased that they added a YouTube app! That was the number one drawback for me when considering this device. From what I've read, I figured I'd sideload one, but they saved me the trouble.Once I signed in to YouTube and linked my mobile devices, I even gained the ability to send content to my TV for viewing! I don't have a Fire phone or Kindle (although I do have a Paperwhite), so I'm not able to comment on the connectivity with those.I can't say enough good things about this tiny box. I've had it for a couple of months and use it every day!  The user interface is intuitive and efficient. I really love the screen saver pictures, too. Most of them are breathtaking, and they seem to update periodically. The voice search is very accurate. There are a decent amount of apps for added content. I mostly stick to the abovementioned sources, but I added Crackle for a bit of variety.My only complaint would be about the rewind/fast forward. It's not intuitive, and takes some getting used to. I don't use that feature often, so it's no biggie to me.I did feel a bit weird about not being able to turn it off at first, but I got used to that, too. Just make sure to press the Home button when you're done for the evening or whatever, because you leave it paused in the middle of a show or something, it won't go to sleep. It remembers your place in whatever you were watching, so no worries about that.I look forward to continued software improvements, and plan on getting a game controller sometime soon, so I can try out the games.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Grace L. Thompson \"Industrial Engineer\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own a roku and apple tv and have to say that the Amazon Fire TV falls into more of the apple tv category.  It's definitely a walled garden of content that feeds you into amazon's prime tv offerings.  You can access a lot of titles there for pay and often less expensively than On Demand options available from your cable provider.However, for your prime investment, there are no free titles.  I'd love to see Amazon take a netflix model for a certain number of older titles.  The price barrier keeps me from watching older titles, but the prices of latest releases are about average and worth it.The interface is great.  I find the voice activation to be really accurate and easy to use.  It's really how you are meant to navigate the massive number of options available.Performance is best in class as the Fire TV has a quad core processor that is unmatched by any other provider.  I'd love to see a great game title arrive on the box that would make the game controller worth the investment.  However, for an all-in-one, solution the game selection can definitely hit the spot.I use the plex and netflix apps available for this device and they perform great.  Certainly, there's no blu-ray player that can match the capability of this device.All-in-all I definitely recommend this device to anyone, but still prefer the Roku since Roku isn't selling its own content service, so it agnostically serves a lot of free content that you didn't even know existed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Thomas B"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I already have 2 Roku devices, but thought I would give this new Amazon device a try.  This device works fine for the Amazon Instant video app, but there is a terrible lag in the video on the Netflix app that makes it unusable on this device.  I know this issue is not my internet connection as the Netflix app works great on the Roku devices.  In addition, the user interface on this device is generally just not that great.

Easy to set up just remember to also purchases an hdmi to hdmi cord that does not come with the Amazon fire tv or you will have to wait to get started.

Believe it or not, I sit and watch the screensaver lots a lot because the pictures are just that good. It is like taking a trip around the world. The amount of things you can do with this Fire TV is pretty incredible to me. There is so much on here and that can be added as apps is impressive. There is a massive amount of things to watch, both free with Prime and much that is a fee to rent or buy. I am glad I made this purchase. This unit is so small I will take it with me on vacation and just plug it in to any TV with the HDMI and keep up with my favorite shows.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Don Clayton"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I am not pleased, every movie I select is a pay for view.
