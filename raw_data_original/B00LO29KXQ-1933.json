We had one new smart tv in the living room and did not want to spend more money for one for a second TV. We have a basic hdtv with a USB port so we bought the Fire Stick for this tv so I could watch movies that my wife doesn't want to see while she is in other room watching her programs. Now I am not technically inclined but if you know how to use a remote or a cell phone to move through various pages you can use this. Saving lots of money and have lots of choices. Plus there's nothing sitting on counter, just a USB device that plugs into the TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GARY BOTTS"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought two of these. One for a gift and one for myself. Great streaming device for the money. Nice UI. Good size for travel use as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike Shake"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I do love this - I did not give it a 100% rating because of a couple of things. You have to actually plug the unit into an electrical device, so you may have to move a lot of furniture and stuff to get it working. Also, I figured out how to access the Fire Stick from my Cable Remote, but I have to go to the AC Receiver to get the Cable TV back on (talk about being lazy :). The other thing I did not like is that I got hooked on watching a \"series\" from the Stick, but when I got to a more recent \"season\" for the series, I had to pay $20 to watch those 9 episodes. I thought that was high, and I had just assumed that this would have been included in the subscription.In regards to the AC Receiver which connects to a sound bar - Amazon technical support did not know how to get the sound bar to work with the Stick. I did figure out that if you plug the Fire Stick directly into the AC Receiver you can take advantage of the sound bar.Lastly, Amazon technical support is awesome just the same. I would recommend making purchases from Amazon any time!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christine"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Avidreader"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It works fine, not great.
