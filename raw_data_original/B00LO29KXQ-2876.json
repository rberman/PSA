There are alot of others complaining about connectivity. Yes, this is a smart device, so you will need a fairly recent router, just like the rest of the streaming devices. Comparing a generic 3 year old dlink $50 router to my current asus $200 router, the fire stick will work with outdated equipment, but in this day there will be too much interference for 3 smartphones, 1 tablet, 2 desktops, and 1 laptop to work at the same time, firestick is a little more sensitive to poor network setups than others. Any router with ac will be able to handle this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bazzeil"}]
