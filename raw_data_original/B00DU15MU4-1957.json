[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Used to swear by my Roku's/Chromecasts and couldn't conceive how Amazon could do it better, but they did.  I don't have any issues so far.  The only reason I gave it a try was because I was having too much buffering issues on my Plex and Roku.  I don't have any buffering issues anymore.  Thanks Amazon fire.

Fooled around a little with it after a few weeks and started seeing all the stuff it could do! Ordered a 2nd unit for the living room because it's faster than the smarts in our pretty new TV! No more Netflick crashes. Rarely a lag time... MANY more shows with Amazon Prime which by the way at $99 a year is cheaper than Netflicks. Not to mention it makes a great addition especially with free expedited shipping, music, other channels and tons of free or near free apps! Did I mention we do not have cable or satellite TV? ....and if I could get rid of this monopoly phone service who makes you have phone to get internet, I'd drop it for a Magic Jack phone (I use one for fax line they're great too) it was my primary home phone for years until I moved into Windstream's monopoly. At least AT&T; and local cable company will let you have internet with out phone or TV!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Michael Zukas"}]
