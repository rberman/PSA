I guess as a Miracast dongle it is well worth the money, and if the screen casting worked smoothly I'd be tempted to give it more stars just for that.  But it is very flaky and doesn't like to connect to most of my devices the first time.  Probably because of the flaky WiFi...speaking of which, the WiFi connection is horrible.  Some times it drops every few seconds.  No other devices, including Smart TVs, phones, laptops, tablets, etc. have any problems.  It will be showing Very Good signal strength one second and drop the connection the next. I have to reboot it when it gets bad, which sometimes helps. Also probably explains why movies keep dropping into low resolution.  I mean LOW resolution!  As in FUZZY.  I gave up on the first movie I tried to watch and haven't tried again.  Music is not too bad.  Apps are lame.  No Web Browser, so you could not use this with a WiFi that requires a web page to activate.  No mail client.  Can't pair BlueTooth keyboards, etc.  LAME LAME LAME", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DrHenley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Has everything I needed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marisela D\u00edaz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "easy setup cancelled the movie channels on fire stick now", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Clarolopez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "we love it so far. start up was simple and it's easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tyla Berger"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It works well.
