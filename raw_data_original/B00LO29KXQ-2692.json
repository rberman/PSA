It is stated on Amazon that Samsung phones should work with the Fire Stick and Fire TV for the \"screen mirroring.\" This is the only reason I purchased this (was for the screen mirroring). I attempted to get the mirroring to work with my phone repeatedly... even called Amazon tech spt for assistance- they tried with me- only to find that after the rep checked his resources, it was discovered that Amazon performed a software update to the Fire stick and TV and these products are currently NOT compatible with android devices at all. The intention is to again \"someday\" be compatible with android devices but he could not tell me when that would be. I am now fighting to get a FULL refund.
