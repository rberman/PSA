[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am very pleased with my purchase of this product.  As others have mentioned, it's hardware is much superior to the competition and videos load almost instantaneously.  The voice search for Amazon content is quite accurate and makes searching quite easy.  Being able to speak the name of an actor, a movie, or TV show name is pretty amazing.  The YouTube \"pairing\" feature is very nice too - the search screen on YouTube gives you a number, which if you type in on your PC or tablet, will allow you to view on TV anything you search for in YouTube from your other device - a nice way to make searches even quicker (or allow you to bring up pre-linked favorites from the other device).I had watched things on my TV using my Kindle Fire HD and a 15-foot HDMI cable, which seemed fine.  But being able to watch basically anything I want, and wirelessly is a big improvement (and it doesn't tie up the Fire from anyone else using it).The device is very small (4 1/4\" square) and less high than the height of dime's diameter.  Connecting is very easy, and the input is the standard WiFi password  (registration is automatic if you purchased from your Amazon account).The remote is quite small (about 5 x 1 1/2\") which is a pro and a con.  It takes up no space,  but because of that is easy to get lost in the couch or chair you're in!  It will easily fit in any basket or pocket attached or nearby your viewing area.I found the fast-forward/reverse to work better than my Roku and load the new scenes much more quickly.My wife loves this new device - easy to use, no cables to trip over and very intuitive.  Especially enjoys the voice search and YouTube access (which she finds much more enjoyable on the big screen than her iPad).Another great point is that the remote is a blue-tooth device, which means that you don't have to have line of sight for it to work (which you do have to have with AppleTV).  This means that when our cat sits in front of the device, our remote still works!  That's a big plus in our house.This is one purchase which will be used and enjoyed quite a bit.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/5", "author": "Paxton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have been using a Roku for about a year and was very happy with it.

I used to use my Sony Blue-Ray player, but the wireless connection was so unstable, I had to go to a wired connection.  The Fire TV's wireless performance was flawless.VOICE SEARCH DOES NOT WORK.

The voice search feature has not worked at all. It never finds what I ask  it to find even though all I ask of it is to search in the prime movies. The wireless connection does not remain connected even though it registers a strong signal  It often disconnects.On the plus side I was able to watch a prime movie. By pure luck I was able to turn on subtitles as well. Nothing quite as good as watching a movie and being able to read what the sound is saying as well.Based on the quality of this product I feel that it is overpriced. I will keep it with the hope that future downloadable upgrades will be forthcoming to improve this Fire TV  to at least the level of the latest Roku and more. I have been an Amazon shopper for years and have faith in their ability to produce a quality product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/6", "author": "Duffer. \"Bo\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The 2GB memory makes a difference vs. the Roku 512K.... content loads faster, you can fast forward thru programs without a lag.  I have seen some Amazon reviews that slam it for having a weak processor.... but what they were talking about doing/watch (which wasn't the menu pick streaming choices like Netflix, Amazon, Crackle) was esoteric to me.  The faster processor and more memory (compared to the Roku 3) is noticeable after using the Roku box for so long.Their start-up, out of the box process is flawed though... It started-up fine, connected to my wifi okay, was set-up already to my Amazon ID, but then said it needed to download software updates.... Which was fine except it stopped after about 15 minutes and said it couldn't do so, unplug and try again.  Which I did..... it finally worked, took 30 minutes.  Not the way to impress people with your new box.  I noticed some reviewers on Amazon couldn't get it to finish the software update and the box just gave a white screen.I'm happy with it compared to Roku....... but it is surely an Amazon Prime device..... including the features of streaming/showing videos/photos from your Amazon cloud space.... and being able to start a video on their Fire tablet and \"gesture sweep it\" to stop and start-up on the Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Michael"}]
