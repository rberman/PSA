I like the Plex menu best on the Roku but for the money, I love the Amazon Fire TV Stick.  This item is fairly idiot proof and doesn't require cable clutter.  I have seen reviews where people have to remove their Fire Stick to reboot it between uses, if that's the case I would call Amazon and send it back because it sounds like you have a bad one.  Amazon's support is excellent.Aside from just the sheer stupid simplicity of setting up the device, the wide array of additional apps is another big draw for me.  I have the usual streaming suspects but have just discovered other gems like Crackle (Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee) and of course Ted Talks.Did I mention the lack of cable clutter?  Oh, and if and when you lose your remote your smartphone can be used as your remote.  Smart, very smart.  No cable clutter!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"n_eng\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy with the Fire TV Stick, works Great, very easy to set up and easy to use!I may have to retract my previous statement!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles R.

When it started playing again you would hear the audio only with a paused video feed. Really annoying! It's only 35 ft from my wifi modem. My Apple TV in the same place plays perfectly. The apps aren't that great either. Apple TV has a lot more to offer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kristy Auerbach"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Alot of wanted programs,  u have to pay for them but its nice because it turns ordinary tvs into smart tvs", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Raymond Spinelli"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Not worth it.
