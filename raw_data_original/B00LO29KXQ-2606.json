I have Chromecast also, and Fire Stick seems to have more options. Easy to learn operation, and there are lots of apps for viewing movies, and TV. And of course Prime Movies, TV, and music are great. Hopefully someday we can just pick channels 1 by 1, but my cable is already gone!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Todd Johnson"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love that it works on hotel networks where you need to type in a code for Internet (captive portal)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Indiana Jones"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "All is good as long as you don't try to watch MLB.TV with it.  If you are looking for a way to watch live sports I suggest you go with the Apple TV.  $30 more but at least you can watch a gane without waiting for it to buffer every 20 seconds.  In case you are wondering, I use FIOS for my Internet connection and the buffering has nothing to do with the speed of the connection.

I thought this would work as Roku & offer as such, but falls short to my expectation. Very little free channel offers to choose from. But it does carry all other subscription channels ie Netflix, Hulu. Fire is just a vehicle for Amazon marketing. Any Smart TV already has these feature so there is no reason for Fire.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tweet"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great. we love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sue"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Lightning fast, easy setup, great buy!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris Fort"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "not as pleased with this as I had hoped, still does seem powerful enough to run my tv, has glitches when internet is slow", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "cheryl finch"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Outstanding; I'll never use cable again!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sally L."}]
