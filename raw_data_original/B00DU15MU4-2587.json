If you have a roku or other device you will be very underwelmed.1. No amazon music app, Really they say it is coming I have it on my roku??????2.  A very limited number of other apps.3.  A very small amount of games, and most do not work or work correctly on the fire tv.4.  the voice search works well, but because it only works on amazon, most of the time I forget it is their.5.  No kindle app?? Audio books?I love amazon,  I do 90% of my shoping with them, and rave to my friends about the service.

However, I am a longtime user of the Roku 2 box and I absolutely love it! I just want to point out Amazon's obvious slight to the Roku by ignoreing the fact that Rokus bluetooth remote is also a dedicated game controler that is included with the box and is also very advanced as it uses a gyro and acceleromiter for exelent gameplay(Angry birds sans pushing buttons takes the game to a whole new level). Actualy, I'm very supprised these features were not included by Amazon. I love Amazon and am a little saddened they went this route!!!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "R.

It opens, downloads, and loads all applications at an outstanding rate. It scrolls, plays, fast forwards, and rewinds video without hesitation.The Roku 3 I owned holds up better in comparison, and far out strips it in application content. But even that cannot compete with the lightning fast reflexes of this device.The voice function is very handy, though I do not use it much as I am not like Gary Bussey with my taste for talking to inanimate objects.But all things considered, I cannot say that I find much use for it as of right now. Yes, I can watch Netflix, and Amazon video on demand content, but the wealth of media centered, and game centered, applications available on the Play store that I cannot access, decidedly deters me from using this great device for more than background noise when I'm trying to fall asleep. ( it has been relegated to my bedroom until its usefulness out-performs that of my HTPC ) So, I will say this. HURRY IT UP DEVELOPERS!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Nick"}]
