[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nifty little device, but the Apple IOS app does not have all the features that are advertised (such as watching something on your phone/tablet and then flipping it to your tv screen).  Also be aware that the stick does not draw power from your tv, you must plug it in to a wall socket in addition to plugging it into an hdmi port.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joshua"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works as advertised.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James L.

Been a prime customer and fan of Amazon for years. Bought this device when it first came out for 19 bucks . As everyone knows , it took many weeks to actually arrive but that was okay as it was going to be a Xmas gift . Gift was given Xmas eve to in-laws. Christmas day my credit card was charged for another prime account while was out of town. I later that day found out that it was unknowingly bought by my in-laws when trying to watch a movie . Long story short ......THIS device ships preregistered to buyer ! , no login or password required to use ! Unacceptable !  My account was accessible to the gift recipient ! Amazon credited my account and deregistered the device over the phone, but I feel this should, at the very least require a password before it is usable to prevent  someone getting the device who is not authorized. Shipping the device preregistered and ready to use is not a secure situation for customers !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "billy bob"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love this amazon stick very fast and reliable", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mario Gonzalez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TAEIL GOH"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My husband loves this way better than the Apple TV!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lea Anne Douglas"}]
