[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it and I am techno limited.  I love my new Fire TV Stick.  Plugged it in, followed on screen questions and it was ready to go.  Great movies and TV series from which to choose.  I was surprised at how much I like the Music from my Amazon Prime music.  For those techno limited as myself, you do have to keep the Fire TV Stick plugged into the electrical outlet while in use.  At first I thought it was like those memory stick which you use on your computer....wrong!  This you have to keep plugged into the port on the TV and the electrical outlet.Congratulations Amazon, this is a winner!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elizabeth Spencer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Do enjoy this very much....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great family time!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tara Black"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The fire stick plays the movies from my flixster account.
