I love Amazon and I am a prime member so I figured this was an obvious buy.  Most of the apps on the stick would not work.  I called Customer Service who told me they reset it and those apps would work when I got home.  They didn't.  Then I called again and they told me the fire stick is not compatible with many of the apps.  I got so frustrated I'm just sending it back.  I have Roku and I love it!  I'm returning the Amazon Fire Stick.  I still love Amazon, but they need to fix some things on this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Meredith Mclamb"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's a very good item", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "shawn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's womderful !

It's not user friendlyThings I suggest:.Warn people about the fact that a USB port and a HDMI port look very similar.  Tell them to consult their TV product manual to determine where the HDMI ports are..Make the *(^)%^$&^ remote easier to open to put batteries in.  I had to get on to the amazon devicesupport web page and request a call before I figured out that the battery cover doesn't slide open, you have to \"pop\" it open.  I have arthritis so I had to get a screwdriver to open it.Also it would be easier if the user could search for titles instead of having to browse which can take forever.  If the search feature is there I haven't been able to find it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Emily Skurka"}]
