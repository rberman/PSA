Super simple installation, pre-registred (nice touch), works as advertised,Why 2 stars?  Amazon's deceptive sales practice.  When one signs up for Amazon Prime there is no upfront warning that Prime TV cannot be received by all current TV makes and models. You are not directed or notified to first check the list of compatible Prime TVs.  So instead of Amazon asking for the TV make & model first they gladly take your $99 and you find out after the fact you cannot receive Prime TV and have no idea why.  In the case where your TV is incompatible with Prime you would think Amazon would at least offer the Fire Stick at half price.  I asked, they said no way but you can wait for a sale.  I don't like being sucked in........So the real cost for Amazon Prime (to work on my Samsung Smart TV) was $99 plus $40 for the Fire TV stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Joep42 \"Retired Geek\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best thing after slice bread!!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rafael nieto"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I can't really rate this item but I will leave a comment.
