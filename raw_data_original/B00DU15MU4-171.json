This a big learning curve for me with no instructions and so far I can access nothing (so far) without paying extra.  It says all those things are included, but I have yet to find out how.Most of the times when I have taken the time to sit down and try to access things it says HOME is not available and nothing else on the menu is available either and yet it says I have a very good connection to WiFi.  It's very difficult to try to learn how to use it when nothing is available for you to see.
