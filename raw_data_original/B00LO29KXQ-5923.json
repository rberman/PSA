[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Super slim gadget that pops right into your HDMI port.  I was up and running with Amazon Video and Netflix within minutes.  It had to run through the typical updates, but it was completed in 10 minutes.  What I love about Amazon's \"Fire\" line is the super sexy, classy packaging.  I thought Apple had the market cornered on presentation, but Amazon \"Fire\" is taking over in this area. I love the black packaging with 'Fire' orange accent.  Remote is very light and small.  Love the fact that the up/down/side to side circle bar on the remote is big enough for a good \"press\" of the fingertip.  Way to go again, Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "PussyCatMalone \"Feline325\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It is very hard to use the fire stick if you want to view shows on Netflix. The system does not retain your log in data therefore you have to go through the paswords etc each time you want to use the  fire stick to view Netflix. this is NOT true of ROKU .
