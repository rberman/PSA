Works just like the Fire-TV (which I have and use daily for seamless streaming  movies from Prime and Netflix) but with fewer options through the remote.  Would recommend.  Just make sure there is an outlet near by as it has to be plugged in for its power source.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "fool4fish \"radmathman\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy to set up, fairly easy to navigate.
