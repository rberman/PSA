[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Well, a work in progress.  But so far,kinda cool. Okay so update.  I like the service, but this thing keeps happening.  My service keeps shutting down and telling me that my wi-fi access is great but that my connectivity to amazon is bad.  So then I have to reboot my computer, and then everything is fine.  This has happened almost everyday that I have had the firestick connected to my computer.  I like the service and I like it connected to Prime, but please, figure this out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Greg T Long"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Nice", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Grim Sorrows"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works fine", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marilyn Lee Baranyi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very please.

I held off on the Google Chrome device and now I'm glad I did. We use our Fire TV Stick on a nightly basis now, and it works great. We cut cable almost 2 years ago and have yet to find a device that really nails a lot of what we're missing. ESPN, Plex, Netfilx and Amazon Prime selection has just about everything we need. I see that TNT is becoming more stream friendly, so once they release an Android/FireTV app, we'll have everything replaced... without the $100 cable bill.From an operation standpoint, it works great. We use our Logitech Hub Remote 99% of the time, but the iPhone app works solid, and so does the remote. We probably unplug/reboot the stick once every two weeks as it seems like some apps become unresponsive, but thats understandable with technology. Sometimes you just need a reboot.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Trent Gillespie \"Trent Gillespie\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love having all my shows in my room!!

Please Amazon change this feature because the landscapes that Fire TV Stick screensaver brings are beautiful. It would be nice to view them while listening to Pandora.
