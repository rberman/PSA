Did not give it 5stars because compared to Apple TV it is lacking in some areas.  I find it very frequently lags freezes when streaming video or movies.  I have very fast internet speeds (over 70mps download) and still the videos lag.  Also the way it displays the content can often be less than user friendly.Enough of the negatives...For the price and simplicity, this device is great.  I love that you can add different apps based on your needs.  The iPhone remote controller app also works very well!In summary, I would recommend this product but still prefer Apple TV overall.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.

I have a hunch there are wires or other metals in the wall that are behind the TV that interfere with the roku and though the router is strong and in the same room, occasionally (two or three times a day) the Roku drops signal and re-boots.  And, two different TVs have been in this one location and the problem happened with both.  This is annoying and if I am deliberately leaving the TV on, say for music streaming, the streaming is shut down until I sign in to the streaming service again.  I did not contact Roku because I have found their support lacking.I bought a Netgear router to see if that was the problem and in fact it is much stronger than the one Verizon Fios provided me (they won\u2019t admit that) so the speed of the downloads and the frequency of dropped signal were less,  but, still occuring.I then bought the fire stick hoping that the communication between the router and the fire stick would not be interrupted and after 24 hours it has not (not constant operation).There are two downsides to the Fire stick.  One, I had hoped it would draw sufficient power from the HDMI jack; it does not, so it does need supplemental power (power source provided in the box), which means I have one power wire I cannot conceal.  No big deal.  The second problem is that I stream music from Spotify.  The fire stick does not have access built in apparently so I had to (and it worked) download an app.  When I want to use Spotify I have to start it via my cell phone rather than just using the fire stick remote.  Not a big deal but took me awhile to figure out what they were trying to get me to do.  I have to imagine there are other programs out there that have the same requirements and I hope Amazon is not being dishonest by leading the user to Amazon prime (built in to the fire stick) instead of Spotify or other music streaming services and, again, it does work.The rest is all good.  This thing is speedy, a bit faster than Roku. It is less bulky (would be even less so if it did not need the power cord).  It was very easy to set up and, as I wrote earlier, seems to have taken care of the problem I was having with the dropped signal to the Roku.  During programs, such as music streaming, where there is no viewer interaction, the screen defaults to beautiful (probably UHD) photographs of geographic features from around the world.After one day I am happy with it other than the Spotify streaming complication and would buy it again.  I will consider it as gifts during the upcoming holiday season.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karen53501 \"Karen Tyson\""}]
