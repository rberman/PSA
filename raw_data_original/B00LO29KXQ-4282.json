When the salesperson mentioned the Stick and how much cheaper it was than the Roku2 I was intrigued. I really only used the Roku to stream Netflix, Pandora, and a few other apps. So if you are not planning on using all 1,000 plus apps on Roku and are satisfied with the ones the Stick has to offer then the Stick is for you for a lot less money than Roku.
