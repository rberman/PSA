[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Worked great for four days. I told my wife how awesome and easy to use it was. Then on the fifth day, no more fire stick. It could see the network but although every other device in my house could connect, the fire stick could not. Now I'll have to spend time working this through customer support. Just another cheaply made product by Amazon. My kids have also been through two kindles that died less than 30 days after the 1 year warranty expired. Don't waste your time with this. I have learned to stick with apple products that aren't made so cheaply. I don't know when I'll learn my lesson!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Tim"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install. Easy to use.
