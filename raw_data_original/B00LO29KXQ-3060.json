[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Movies and other type shows will stop and freeze several times during the showing while the download catches up. This is extremely annoying since it breaks up any continuity the show might have while your wait for a minute or two while the download in going on. We experienced this same problem with Apple TV while living in Mexico for a while. We thought it was because of poor internet connections there, but were very surprised after getting Fire Stick that it has he same problem here where we have a great internet connection. We also have an old Blue Ray disc player that has Netflix on it, and had to switch over to that to finish the show. The Blue Ray player has a built in buffer that allows a complete download upfront. Fire Stick and Apple TV apparently don't have a buffer, so they download in segments thus creating this same problem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dr. Susan Rutherford"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Fernando Bugliani"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the fire TV stick, very convenient if you have netflix account, or you may purchase new  titles at amazon I think the are somewhat pricy, games etc. Now the also have Pandora!!! Yeah!You must have a good internet service and great if u only like or have time to watch movies, or Previous Tv series.What I don't like is that netflix have a very limited amount of movies. The other day I wanted to watch ( the help) and it wasn't available :!  I have never use the games application so I don't know how they work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mrs.Purple"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love Amazon and the Fire stick is my favorite media player.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jr"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product!!

Just hooked it up yesterday in the teen room, as we are slowly cutting the dependence on cable TV.  Product comes with an HDMI cable, and reviews strongly recommend in order to enhance performance, the stick needs to be connected to the HDMI and included power source.  Also comes with a tiny connector cable (we're not sure of its purpose). Set up is EXTREMELY easy!  Nice short animated video tutorial on how to get started.  Gives you the option of setting parental controls or can go in later to do so.  Unfortunately, the worst part of this entire deal is the included remote.  Utter fail Amazon!  We had to google how to open the darn thing and ended up using a knife.  It was an awfully frustrating experience.  Hopefully Amazon will read all the negative reviews/issues with the remote and design a better accessory.  We have a Netflix account as well as Amazon Prime Video; haven't yet established an account with Hulu.  You can store photos on the stick (not sure how).  Has a screen saver which is really neat.  Though it has only been 24 hours, so far we are pleased with this product and will purchase one for the preteen room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "amomma"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Not what I expected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "roy mock"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just got this on April 2, 2025. I bought this to use at work. Plugged it in at home to get it all set up and I was really impressed. It was super easy to set up and navigate. The little tutorial video at the beginning was cute and helpful as well. Load time is a little slower then my PS3 and ps4, but it's not terrible. Overall I'm extremely happy with this product. I really didn't know what to expect since I've never used anything like this before for streaming. The true test will be when I take it to work with me on Monday, if it sets up on that TV just as easily.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A. Bartley"}]
