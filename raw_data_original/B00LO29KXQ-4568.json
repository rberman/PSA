Was surprised that CDs I had purchased in the past off of Amazon were already loaded on my account. Seriously considering buying another for use on other TV's or for travel.

Same problem as many others; the connection drops constantly. We haven't been able to watch a single movie. The router is a foot away from the stick. Tried another HDMI port, rebooting, even went back to factory defaults and set it up again.  The WIFI TV and the WIFI DVD player stream perfectly and never lose a connection. I love shopping at amazon but I don't plan to buy any more of their electronics.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "gofish"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use.
