I've downgraded my att uverse to the basics package because of their rates!

I absolutely *love* that the device incorporates screen mirroring.  The FTV stick pairs marvelously with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 and it's screen appears on my HDTV!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Former Yooper"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "So. Uh. We can't use this, basically.  We instantly lost the very tiny remote.  It works with my android phone, but it's kinda crappy and slow to use that way. I'm the only one who has an android phone, so my wife can't use it and my inlaws who come over to watch our kids some mornings can't use it.  Also, it keeps asking for my Netflix username and password to be reentered, which has to be done laboriously using the herky jerky android app.  I had bought this just for Netflix to replace the broken Wii (doesn't play Wii discs anymore) we'd been using just for Netflix.  I was so happy to have retired that Wii to the basement box of electronics doom, hoping my days of pointing a little thing at a screen to and getting frustrating were over.  Turns out I was doing the same thing with this thing, but instead of doing it to pick movies to watch, I was constantly re-entering passwords.  Add to that that without the remote your cell phone can't find the damn stick unless its woken up, but it goes to sleep and needs the remote to wake it up! So every time you use it (without the remote) you have to go over and unplug it and then plug it back in.  Horray! The future!  I tried to buy a replacement remote, but apparently it takes months and months because of the backlog. So guess what?  That Wii got dragged back out of retirement.  So much for the Firestick... At least it was only $19.  Also -- yeah - -this was probably our fault for losing the remote and having iphones, sure. But - so, 1 star review given I have a 2 year old who likes losing tiny remotes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Tom Weaver"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazingly Quick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Roman Gunther"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was a bit disappointed since the original ad for this stick stated you could \"cast\" with it like the Google chrome stick. If you are looking for a less expensive device to stream from Amazon rather than their Amazon Fire TV, this will do it. Some reviewers said that the lack of power compared to the Fire TV, may cause some stuttering when streaming. I bought it because Amazon has done a great job with  its products in the past and this supposedly was more powerful than the Google Chromecast device. The Amazon stick cannot cast from your PC or tablet or android phone like Google Chromecast.  I pre bought the Amazon stick  at a low $20 price, since I was interested in whether it was better  for casting and the price was low enough to be willing to play with it. I already own an Amazon  Fire TV box, which has been an excellent product. Personally, I  recommend that you pay the extra cost for  the Fire TV box instead of the Amazon stick. If you want to cast from your PC, phone, or tablet, then you really want to buy the Google Chrome cast device. The only reason I can see for purchasing the Amazon stick, is if you want to stream movies and don't want to pay the higher price that the Amazon Fire TV costs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gordon R.

Easy to operate and is very fast.  No problems at all.  I'm not a fan of using a power cord directly to it but other than that I have no complaints whatsoever.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "WDWFan"}]
