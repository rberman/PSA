I really like it. The interface is smooth. Netflix, Amazon Instant Video and YouTube all look crisp in 1080p. That coupled with SlingTV This is my set top box for the TV in my bedroom. I use the FireTV in the living room. Its basically the best you could buy for 40 dollars. The only place I took off a start was for the remote.

I gave this a two star rating because of the Best Buy store employee!! I just wanted something that would put my laptop screen onto my television period. The store employee lied and told me that this product did that. I wanted to play Youtube video's and this doesn't do that it just plays prescribed video's (on demand). I went back to thee store and asked for my money back. The employee that helped me with the returned item told me that I should have directed to just a cable not the Fire TV Stick.
