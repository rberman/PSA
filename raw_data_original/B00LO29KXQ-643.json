Works for about two weeks then I have to unplug it to force a reboot.  Also every couple days it loses connection and you have to start the program over (okay for most apps but sucks for sling TV).  This being said it's 40$ and works most of the time.  It turns an old TV into a smart TV, but I prefer my actual smart TV or my Xbox.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ralph Knowlden"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really like this thing but I have a hard time getting it to get it out of sleep mode If anybody can help me out with this, I'd appreciate it!!
