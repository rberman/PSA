I was so tired of using my cell, laptop, and tablet to navigate all the different apps.  This is a ONE-STOP-SHOP!  I can now listen to Pandora, watch movies on Netflix or on my Amazon Prime Account.  It's really been the best $$$$ I've spent in a while.

When I ran a test on the device, it said it was connected with good strength. I unplugged and restarted the Fire TV stick multiple times. I restarted my internet multiple times. Both my cell phone and laptop were connecting to the internet alright. At the end of the night I made the decision to just return the product altogether. It's an awesome concept, but unfortunately I think that I just received one that was bad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Stephanie Matsey"}]
