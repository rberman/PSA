[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Amazon Fire TV is awesome. It offers a very snappy interface and no wait time for videos to start playing even on my DSL connection. Sure, some people are haters and don't appreciate quad core performance, or a dedicated graphics chip that pushes 1080p with no issue. Others may poke fun at the optical audio out, which is great for those who have projectors and need to send video to the projector and audio to their AV receiver, but they do so out of envy, port envy.I also look forward to what Amazon Game Studios will cook up along with other game devs.Lastly I cannot wait to see the look on the our kid's faces when the free time message pops up telling them to get off their ass  like mom and dad told them to and go outside. It works on the Kindle Fire and will be great on the TV. MWAHAHAHA!!!If you need beta testers Amazon, you have my info.Great job Amazon! Haters might hate, but that's because waiting for their streamed videos to begin playing over the years has made them sad, angry people.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "12/14", "author": "Mapper"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Well,As a developer using the same hardware as inside the fire TV that is also extremely capable of 2160p or 4k output decoding and encoding at 10-15% load I am not at all surprised that Amazon got it right.It just works, the way it should. Have found a few cool bugs but there almost comically irrelevant to what they have achieved, yep the voice commands works although more centric to content of the paid kind. You can't just say something like NPR radio and it finds that you listen to that. However I very much doubt that is an Amazon thing and more the lazy developers of the radio apps that seem to have slipped in there own advertising to free radio streams. That's another story.Amazon thank you for not bombarding this box with pointless annoying and meaningless adverts of the banner kind. Perhaps you actually realize that most people don't buy the crap that is forced by annoying banner adverts and an overwhelming number of us deliberately avoid such things because of this (Google styled pathetic advertising bubble)Anyway to the fire TV box. Well crapple and joku and  all the other crap little so called smart e-waste boxes. Goodbye little ill thought junk. As a user of Roku products all 4 of them I won't miss that slow clunky experience at all. You really had your chance but blew it with Broadcom hardware and overheating little boxes. Yeah it is better than anyone else, apple TV is just a pathetic joke so I won't comment as its a waste of any form of thought or innovation unless you have Cupertino plague and can't see past the rectal display on your idrone.So the meaty bit, if amazon dons not block this review then if you have a 4k TV in a few months guess what, you will have to do nothing to have 4k piped to you from I imagine either Netflix or amazon, the box does it now. Its hidden in the menu by choice. Not by design.An update will occur and you will not need to do a thing. Anyone that says anything else will be exercising there astonishing knowledge of self worth. As I mentioned this hardware that I have both Qualcomm implementations for development is based around 4k video pipelines and an ability to accommodate up to 55mp for cmos sensors.Regardless of that upgradability its a fast box, the audio is correct and blows away the 5.1 ability of the or any Roku, does grapple even do 5.1. who cares. The image quality is as expected from the hardware an improvement on the others. All of them and it will even ramp up and begin to add load to a 100mb internet connection.If you have invested your life and a lot of money into the Cupertino dream. Perhaps you should wait or just buzz off back to spastic land and enjoy overpriced outdated monoculture crap. Sorry has to be said.My only dislike is that its loosely related to Google or android however there is a nice little button in the menu that turns app usage stats on or off. For the rest, well there is no real reason mot to trust amazon, there is every reason in. The world not to trust Google.Oh don't they make that crapcast thing that of you spend hours you can watch YouTube full of adverts but only if you have a tablet and aurally complicated and pointless setup that leaves you wondering why they bothered or if as you give it permission to access your network, does it just get a good look at everything you do on that network as well.Amazon seems to sell an experience aimed at the user. Not an experiment to collect the users data.If amazon screws something up they stand to loose billions. Google could not care less and will try to invade at any cost. Apple. We'll leave that to the its better and faster this year. This one works. But next year we can say the same. And the best bit is you will believe anything we say. Yay....Oh did I mention it does flawless 4k playback, well there is a small audio clipping issue and some banding artifacts in the resemble to hd for the current hd at 60p however that's what happens when you squash 2160p without mastering it for this purpose. All the snapdragons do it even at 4k from a shaded issue but I won't get into that...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "14/34", "author": "whooble"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Where's the Vudu app???

The remote is very light, yet feels solid.Unboxing of the Fire TV was very easy and set up involves plugging in Power and HDMI cable (HDMI cable does not come with the unit).It quickly found my remote, then it found my WiFi network, I typed in the password, and it was connected and downloading an update. The update took FOREVER to download (no way to know if it was my connection or if it is just a large/slow update - maybe it was slow with everyone plugging in their Fire TVs and updating them at the same time). To clarify, the download was slow, but the \"Installation\" of the update was quick.It then immediately started playing a tutorial video, so don't walk away while updating, or you might miss the welcome video.Also, I recommend setting parental controls during setup (even if you don't have kids). To prevent anyone from purchasing things to your account while you are not home! (Unless you really trust everyone in your home).*I initially gave it 4 stars, but I have since changed it up to 5 stars, since the only thing that it is really missing is HBOGo (which I can just watch on my TV, Kindle Fire, or Roku). The games work well, and possibilities for integration between tablets and the Fire TV for games is very promising.I also got the Amazon Fire TV game controller.  I was going to wait, since I feel that it is pricey at $40, but I'm glad I got it to get the full experience. I don't have any other video game systems, as they are too expensive for the limited use I would give them, but this remote actually feels good in my hands. Not too heavy, not too light, yet it feels substantial enough that you might forget that you are playing games on a \"streaming TV device.\" I wish I had purchased a second one now, as they are on back order for several weeks.Pros:-Voice search works well! Makes it really easy to jump straight to what you want, if you know what you want to watch!-Works really well with Prime, I recommend having Prime if you'll use the shipping and free movies.-Quick! The Fire TV loads movies and menus very quickly!-Video quality is great!-You can get captions on Prime shows (when available)-Optical Audio out (so you can hook up a surround sound or other speakers).-Hulu Plus is available and works well (though not as fast as Amazon's videos) captions also work (press up on control for options while video is playing).-Games! Lots of games already available and more will likely come. I got a shooter game (Sev Zero)\u00a0Sev Zero\u00a0free with the purchase of the remote, and it is pretty good!Cons:-No HBO Go :( I imagine that HBO will be added soon, but if you are planning on watching Game of Thrones this weekend, You won't be doing it on the Fire TV (although you might be able to \"fling\" it to the TV from a tablet, haven't tried that yet).-Initially a little confusing as to which shows/movies are free/included with Prime, some shows display a price, even though they are free with a Prime account.-More expensive than other options (Roku, Chromecast).-Netflix and Hulu seemed to load a bit slower than I expected (but still quicker than the Roku).-Apps a little slow to download and install (ex: Vevo took about 25 seconds to download, install, and launch the first time-Remote doesn't have a headphone jack like the Roku's (not a big deal, unless you like to watch stuff while a spouse is sleeping, like I do).Overall opinion: I love it and I am happy I got it, but if you don't have Prime, and if you do have a Roku, you could probably wait on buying the Fire TV at this time (unless you really want it for the games). However, I don't think the Chromecast is a suitable replacement for the Fire TV (or for the Roku for that matter). I think this device has a lot of potential for future apps and games. I would definitely recommend it.Feel free to post a comment if you have any questions, and I will do my best to answer it quickly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "13/16", "author": "R.

It was implied that voice search would span content sources (e.g. Netflix, Hulu), but in fact, it only searches Amazon content. I feel a bit  deceived.Also, the Prime content (included at at no additional charge with the membership fee) and paid content (charged per episode/movie) is not clearly delineated, making the Amazon content frustrating to browse.The graphics and UI are fantastic, and the hardware is impressive, but so far, the overall experience is wildly lacking.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "33/41", "author": "DZB"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I just unpackaged and started using the Amazon Fire TV. Right off I had to do a small update which didn't take long at all. Next there is a neat video that shows you how to use the device. I think this is the first time I have had a video box teach me how to use it with a video. It is a nice touch.I'm already a prime member, but for those who are not the video spoke of a 30 days trial.Right off the bat I noticed in the main menu of items to choose from that there are movies, tv, watchlist, video library, games, apps, photo and settings. What's missing from this is the Amazon Music of which I have quite a few albums. I hope we get to see music in some future update. That's kind of a glaring omission in my opion. One star knocked off for that right there.One cool feature I noted right off the bat is that the device already knows me. I didn't have to log in or do anything.The watchlistSo I went straight to my watchlist to confirm that it indeed already knows me. It does. And I went to a recent season of shows I am watching where the first two episodes have been watched and the third has not. There is a white bar at the bottom of those watched and missing from the one that is yet to be watched. So I'll guess that is my progress bar as well. Nice touch.Voice featureThis feature is slightly confusing to me right off. What you do is hold the mic button down until you hear a tone, then continue to hold it down as you speak your question or title search. When you are done talking, only then do you release the button. I kept letting it go as soon as I heard the tone, which causes it to attempt to process the question. So the feature is a little odd, but once you get used to that oddity it works quite well.I asked it, \"what's new this week\" and got three suggestions. I further asked it questions like, show me my watchlist which offered me two methods, \"watch list\" and \"watchlist\". Neither of which showed me my actual watchlist. Clearly the audio search isn't yet fully aware of navigation.Purchasing a TV showPhotosLooks like they have an iOS and Android app that lets you share photos with Amazon Cloud Drive and thus have them available on this device. I'll have to try that out. I'll skip it for now.AppsThis looks good for now. NetFlix and Pandora are here as well as Hulu. I use all three of those so that's good.GamesThere are good looking games here. I didn't buy the game controller as I own a console already, but I might rethink that.YouTubeI didn't see YouTube, so I did a voice search and an app popped up. Once the app downloaded and installed, I had to visit an activation page of YouTube to connect it to the device. Very simple and now I have YouTube on here.NetFlixNetflix didn't have a simple activate system. I had to punch in my email and password via the remote. Boo! In this era of complex passwords, activation should become a standard function on TV based media devices.NavigationThe navigation is quite smooth. I guess thanks to some good specs under the hood. This device doesn't feel sluggish at all. Getting to your watch this is as fast as hitting 'home' and then moving up or down from wherever you left off. I can do it in a second. There is also a nice back button so you can navigate backwards. All device should do this. Works perfectly.Fast ForwardWhen you are watching a movie, you can fast forward and see a small picture window that gives you a visual preview of the fast forward event. It's really well done.
