I thought of setting it up the next day Saturday, since I was pretty tired and didn't want have to deal with any set up hassles.  After reading the directions decided to go ahead and give it try since it seemed easy enough. I had it up and running in about 10 to 15 minutes. It's all plug and play.  The only thing that help me up a bit was trying to open the remote control cover to install the batteries and navigating the remote to put in my wifi password (instructions on remote are non existant). In case anyone has any problems in navigation of the remote control to set up the password; use the select (big round button on the Fire TV stick remote control).  Other than that the rest was a breeze for this 55+ lady. I was able to watch a good movie in bed using my  Fire TV Stick and Amazon prime!Update:  I liked it so much I ordered a Second One for my bedroom.
