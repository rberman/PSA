Simple, easy to use and Amazon had it hooked to my account before it arrived.  It's fast and reliable.  Just wish there were more free but good shows on Amazon Prime or that rentals were a little cheaper.  Incentives would be nice too - rent 5 movies, get one free type of thing.  Product works great though!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NaturalMomma"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very impressed thus far.Content boots really fast no lag, perfect.best streamer for your buck!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Desmond Thompson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great! iPhone iPad and Droid compatible.

I noticed the prompting to point the stick away from the back of the TV and stuck it in the side port. It finally works!I'm still figuring it out. I switched from Apple TV. I miss my AirPlay. I thought I would be able to mirror any mobile device with this, but it's just Amazon devices. Searching apps is hard, finally found Beachbody OnDemand and am so glad I can use that! Wish I could organize my watch list and separate movies from TV and kids from adult selections. Better filters are also needed. Rather than just entering a password to watch anything I'd like to be able to block certain ratings and content or specific shows from even showing up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "buzyb"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "After having to buy a 3way switch every thing is fine!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "glennadel"}]
