[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I like it but wouldnt pay full price. 25 dollars is q good point not to make me consider returning it even if it fails. Leaving the price aside i can tell you this is a very nice device that works well with Netflix and YouTube.  I dont have other services but use plex for streaming my own content from my mac, plex works flawlessly and i am keeping this device for its ease of use and price, which was 25 on black friday. Be aware the remote is a cheaper one than the one that comes with the regular fire tv, so no voice search unless you download an app or upgrade the remote.  But not bad at all. One thing i didnt like is that the search will not find orange is the new black evem though its available from netflix for free. Instead i was given the option to buy episodes, not cool because my wife could have paid for something we already have.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Richard Inga"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "One problem is on the Fire Stick TV main screen which has the front DVD covers of movies and other programming that is inappropriate for young eyes. These inappropriate images are mixed in with offerings for the young ones. My 7, 11 and 13 year old do not need to see a half-dressed woman on top of her boyfriend or two women kissing. I do monitor my kids, but I shouldn't have to send them out of the room to avoid them seeing the main screen. Additionally, it could still use sports apps like NBC Sports Live Extra and CBS Sports. I also think that for my Amazon Prime membership it is still lacking a few more free TV programs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Tracy Nelson"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Inexpensive, effective and very easy to use.
