Really disappointed with the latency when mirroring from my fire HDX to my TV trough the firestick. With Amazon taking away my ability to download movies to my Tivo I'm searching for a solution and thought the fire stick would be the answer but the quality and latency just doesn't cut it when I download a movie/tv show onto my fire HDX. I have been on the phone with technical support and the ending of the conversation was if all they suggested worked could I let them know. Not very comforting.  I just bought a Kindle Fire second gen from Ebay to download onto that and use a HDMI cable to see how that works. Not happy they took away downloading to Tivo.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I use it in my daughter's playroom connected to her TV and it performs just as expected. It is not as fast as the bigger products but performs remarkably for being so small. Everything I want is on this product and my 3 year old daughter can easily utilize this controller to put on a program she wants to watch. We got rid of cable a couple of years ago and I had been using a Roku and did not like it at all. It was much slower then this and froze alot. Thank you Amazon for making an inexpensive way for watching prime, netflix, and hulu without frustrating me or my daughter from being slow or freezing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Peter Wells"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I like it! 5 stars!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Maciej Miernik \"Gauge Studio\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Nice powerful enough stick for the money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Randy Ernisse"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.
