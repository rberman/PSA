This is perfect!! It hooked up instantly and didn't require any troubleshooting. It loads quickly and has brought new entertainment options into our bedroom (we cut cable over a year ago and rely on digital antenna, Netflix, amazon prime, hbo go, etc).

It is perfect for how I use it.  I became a prime member again after I got it and I watch Netflix and Hulu all the time. I got it mostly for my TV in my bedroom cause it is too difficult to run wires upstairs and this is wireless.  But it is simple to just unplug it from upstairs and take it downstairs if I decide to use it downstairs.  I have not had any problems with it freezing or anything.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "indy"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "The audio would not sync to the tv after the 1st day of use.
