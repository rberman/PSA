I am not technical at all--It is just a matter of plugging the adapter into to Fire Stick and plugging that in theback of the tv and then plugging the plug into the wall outlet. Easy! Then just follow the short movie tutorial and you are ready to go! The movies are on your screen as soon as you pick them out. Plus you can use Amazon Prime or your Netflix (my list). So far the Fire Stick is the best thing ever!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Zee Kay"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "With a great deal of help from Amazon on the phone, it was installed.
