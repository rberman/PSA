[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Mine worked good at first but has increasingly gotten worse. It almost hangs out of the back of my tv because it doesn't quite fit/really needs to be held on with something like duct tape. When people walk by the TV it rattles it out and I have to mess with it to get it to work again. I have a Fire TV and I would recommend that over the fire stick. I am super disappointed in this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AER459"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy setup, easy to use.

I have a 1 megabyte download speed with my ISP, yet this isn't enough to stream anything from the Amazon servers. Glad this was only $40 because it was a complete waste of my money.(a few days later) I went ahead and got a new Samsung smart tv.I had no trouble streaming Amazon shows with my new TV's built in app for Amazon.So it is probably very likely my old tv (2013 Toshiba) that claimed to be smart, just isn't smart enough to stream with the fire stick. I still find it hard to accept using the stick on my old tv would constantly drop the connection. That same Toshiba had some apps too, and it streamed just fine using the built in apps on it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "James B.
