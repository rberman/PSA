I have Fire TV for home since I can hardwire the connection.  However I travel a lot, and I don't like the hassle of only watching things on my tablet or laptop- so I use the Fire Stick.  Worked brilliantly in hotels and Airbnb locations.  Even allowed me to work from my Fire Tablet to beam to the TV for some remote work!And super great is if you have a USB port on the TV, you can run power through the TV rather then using the wall plug for the Fire TV stick.  I still brought the plug just incase, but it worked no problems.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ginna"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product. Very easy to navigate menu.
