[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "After a day of use my inclination is to send it back.  The concept is great, but the execution is lacking.Some problems we've encountered so far are1) Loss of sound requiring hard reboot to restore2) Intermittent remote operation (while sitting 3 feet from the unit).  Certain apps have a tremendously delayed or no response to the remote action.3) Inability to screen mirror to a PC or Android.  On the screen mirroring it just stays in the 'preparing to connect' screen until time-out.  It identifies the connecting device but nothing else.Also, in my opinion the menus need reorganization.  It would be nice to have a favorites section or some way to put preferred apps first.I'll try it for another day or two but as of right now the device is likely going back.*** UPDATE ***I'm revising my initial rating to three stars.  The movies and capabilities there are good.After further research the device really isn't Miracast capable, even though it's advertised as such.  It works on a few devices, but not all Miracast devices, e.g. Windows 8.1.I've lost the sound only once more since posting this review.The remote is a bit buggy, jumping two or three spaces with one click sometimes.I wish the menus could be customized or reorganized.I wish the videos included for free with the Amazon Prime membership could be segregated or easily searched.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/12", "author": "C.
