The UI is just way too much Amazon in your face all the time. I know Amazon is trying to sell content, but this is really over the top. If you're a Prime member you might like it.

Sling TV!!!The Fire Stick is as dirt simple to setup as it can get.  The only way that a person couldn't get this item setup, is to leave it in the box.  I kid you not, there just isn't any way to mess up the installation.  It comes with a short extension cable, which is great, since Sony is still designing their sets like a room full of meatheads.  The range on this device is fabulous.  I had it downstairs in our theater area with the wi-fi upstairs and was still able to stream this quality of video (please see pics!).  The shots were taken from 18 feet away, with a 150\" projector image (the speakers are four feet tall, just to give you a sense of scale)Regarding Sling TV: it's absolutely fabulous!!  Amazon did a great job of making their platform open to so many apps, with this being one of the best!!  Sling TV is EXACTLY what I've been waiting for at a reasonable price point, to boot!  ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, History, H2, HGTV, CNN, Travel, and Food Network!!  Throw in TBS, A&E;, IFC and you've got the best channels (my opinion, I know) for an excellent price!!  The video quality is great!  It's not quite HD, but it's not very far off!The best part is that I got the Fire Stick free with the promo they're running right now!  3 months of Sling TV = free Fire Stick!!  You really can't get better!  Cut off your cable or satellite and get Sling TV with the free Fire Stick!  (No, I don't work for them, just really flippin' overjoyed that I'm getting my most watched channels at 1/5th the price that I was paying!!)

Apps often crash, the UI is confusing to navigate, and we have had to hard reboot the stick at least once a week with daily use because the software would hang.I do not recommend this to anyone.

I have the original Apple TV (with 40GB HD) and it moves about as fast. Some videos load waaaaay faster on FTV than ATV could ever wish to do. But I think the wifi only makes this dongle lag slightly. I've noticed video jerkiness and audio out-of-sync frequently, which I rarely see on my integrated smart tv or on ATV. I'll keep it because it was cheap and it does a few nice things (Prime video, Netflix, Hulu) that I can't do otherwise easily.

However, it totally sucks that Amazon has now placed this at 39.00 when it wasn't long I ordered this and paid $99.00 ! Are you Kidding me..(laughing ) Well here goes the review first wait a while before purchasing and I do mean wait as you can see the price lowers drastically. Next, this little gadget is nice especially when traveling and staying in hotels. Our teen enjoys watching movies , playing games and such. So, on rainy days when on vacation this is sure to keep you entertained if you prefer not to be out in a down pour. It saves money as well from buying movies when your on vacation..thats a plus as hotels charge a bit much.Waiting in an airport on long lay overs wahlah you've got the magic stick to keep you from being bored out of your mind. It's a good deal at 35 bucks so I'd certainly grab a few perhaps for your child that's going off to college this fall!!Thanks Amazon for dropping the price after I purchased at 99.00! \ud83d\ude0f", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lovingfall"}]
