The start up and interface is rather slow compare to the other products. Works well but not what I expected.

No surprises and no problems. Second, it was easy to begin streaming from my Netflix account. The TV picture and sound were perfect with no buffering and no problems in spite of my relatively slow 6 megabit/sec ATT&T; internet connection.It is a bit tedious to enter long strings of text with the remote but at least it works and is usable. Since I don't use a smart phone and I don't have an iPad3 this is my only option short of the new Amazon device that costs twice as much as the $50 Roku.One major comment on content -- I am very unhappy with the Netfilx streaming library. For example, there are huge numbers of major movies you cannot stream on Neflix e.g.\"The Godfather\" is unavailable for streaming on Netflix! On the other hand lots of TV shows that you can stream on Netflix are not available from Netflix as DVDs. BUT, practically EVERYTHING is available from Amazon for streaming over the Roku.For example, I found not only major movies like The Godfather on Amazon but very old movies like Earth v. The Flying Saucers, Them, They Live, This Island Earth, The Tall Blonde Man With One Brown Shoe and lots of others for one-time prices of usually $2.99 though major movies are priced at $3.99. I'm seriously beginning to wonder why I'm paying Netflix $16/month.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "D. alexander \"DMA\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this because it is small and takes up on room.

Of course Amazon Prime, Nexflix, Crackle are popular but the magic of ROKU is the fun of diverse content offerings. Now if only Roku could get some public financing to run a C-span channel. Come to think of it lets petition the FCC to make it apart of their negotiation of the merger of Cable companies to provide that license for the public domain so that content can be made available as the public service it's intended to be!As for the device itself it's powered through the USB port on my HDTV and it's noticeably slower then my Roku 2  but I Love it and you will to!

I've been using  my Sony blu-ray player to stream content, but its been struggling to work well ever since I got it. As a blu-ray player, it works great; streaming content, not so much. So when I saw the Roku stick priced at $50, and it didn't include a bunch of things I didn't want anyway, I was delighted. I'm still amazed that so much technology can be packed into such a small device, but here it is. You just stick the thing into the HDMI port on your TV, follow a few directions, and you're streaming content. This is one of those things that, if it were any easier to use, you'd be doing it wrong. And it's worked without any problems at all. I *highly recommend* this if you want an inexpensive streaming device, and fyi, it does come with batteries!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "breed3134"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I plugged this into the televison I have mounted on my home office wall.
