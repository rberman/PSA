[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have been slowly switching my media streamers from the Roku to Fire TV for a couple of months now.  I previously purchased the Fire TV box for two of my TV's and thought I would give the Fire TV Stick a test rather than the box for one of the TV's.  The price for the stick can not be beat.  We do lose a little bit of functionality with the stick, like the USB storage and I do not think that I will be playing any Gamefly games on this thing.  The smaller CPU may limit how well the regular games run also, but so far it has not been noticed with what the kids play.  Kodi was installed without issue as expected.  I have noticed that Kodi runs a little slower and isn't quite as smooth as the regular Fire TV, but it works well none the less.  This was such a budget purchase that I went ahead and purchased a second Fire TV Stick to get rid of the last Roku.  Now I can move on to other things to tinker with.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ovidson"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like it but can't get you tube videos on it that Iknow of like I can on Chromecast.

With my Prime Member ship, Hulu account, and Netflix account, I only pay one tenth the price to watch television than most people pay for cable or Satellite.  It's worth the purchaes.  Just make sure you have a DSL connection that is better than 10 Mbps to use it.
