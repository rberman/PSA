[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Actually a 3 1/2 would be more accurate.  I love Amazon and their products - big Kindle Fan.  Big Fire TV fan.  I was given a Fire Stick for Christmas because I travel a lot.  I've noticed that I can access the HDMI ports in many hotel rooms so with a Fire Stick, I can travel with movies and TV shows and not be stuck with the crappy programing in most hotels.  It looks so portable in the commercials.  Even the Thumbnail for the product makes it look like it doesn't need any wires.  I thought maybe it was powered by the HDMI port - what do I know?  No.  It has a cord with a convert box that plugs into the wall.  I also had to use the HDMI extender cable on every TV in my home because it would not connect to the WIFI when behind the TV - bummer.  Other than that, it seems as functional as my FIRE TV box - just not as portable and quick one-step as the ads lead you to believe.  The commercial would have you believe Gary Busey could just plug it in and off he goes - sadly, he'd have no better luck just plugging his Fire TV Stick into an HDMI port than a sea shell.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark Harden \"The Animal Wiseguy\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It's an affordable, well-designed, compact streaming device for watching your favorite programs on your wi-fi devices.

I bought this for my bedroom TV, which is 18 steps from the router(20-25 feet in a straight line).  It was able to download its update, but does not have a good enough signal strength to stream.  I tested my ChromeCast on the same TV, and it worked fine.  If they can improve the wifi strength on this, I would give this 5 stars.
