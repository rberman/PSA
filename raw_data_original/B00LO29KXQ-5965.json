Do"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "As other reviewers have mentioned, it is problematic when updating.  After many tries the update completed and I thought perhaps  after the update  it might work well.  However, its connectivity consistency is poor. My router is about 3 feet away and yet it disconnects frequently.  That is unacceptable performance.  Why would I bother continuing with this when my bluray player apps for both Netflix and Amazon Video are consistently fine.  On a positive side it does connect more quickly to Netflix and Amazon Video than my bluray player apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Robert V.

I purchased two for my home and like it so much I purchased a third for use in my RV when I am in a campground with WiFi .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. Hart"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far, so good. I've played with this now for a couple days, and it's very easy to set up and use. I bought this for my bedroom TV for which it works very well.  I primarily use Netflix and Plex (for local files), but the availability of other sources is good.  The only negative so far is I couldn't power the device from the TV's USB port - it required the power adapter to work properly. But it comes with a pretty long USB cable, so it wasn't a huge issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

I have Chromecast as well when compared both performance little better on Fire TV stick because it has more memory. I like Chromecast as well, HBO GO is not there on Fire TV Stick yet. Not sure they get it or not. Overall I liked the product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kishore"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The best $19.00 spent this holiday season. Set up is so easy my 73 year old hubby, whom this was bought and is not one bit tech savvy had it up and running in less than 10 minutes. He LOVES that it will only show those movies and tv shows that are included in prime cutting the frustration level of finding prime included items to zero. He had the apps that matter the most to him ( netflix, and history channel ) loaded in less than five minutes. I loved that it was so easy to find all the photographs and home movies with just a few clicks I was watching the home movies from Thanksgiving day. Set up our fire tablet with the fire tv app so hubby could use it as an additional remote that he can liked that he can use it to do a voice search for his favorite programs. For him the best thing about the entire fire stick package is the simplicity of the remote and how responsive it is. My only regret is not ordering the limit during the special sell to give to our kids as family gifts for them this year.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I'm extremely happy with it, I do hope there are more apps coming down the pipeline for digital content streaming but all in all I'm very happy with the device. The FireTV UI is very clean and the hardware in the TV Stick has (so far anyways) been plenty to keep the UI from becoming laggy when navigating around. As a Prime member I'm very happy with the purchase and the streaming content available, would recommend to others.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adam J Miller"}]
