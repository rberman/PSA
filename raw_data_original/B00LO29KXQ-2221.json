[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I got this to replace my Chromecast. I still love the Chromecast, but the Fire TV Stick can cast Amazon shows, which the Chromecast can't do. I hate having to switch, but this really does work pretty well. The broadcast freezes at times, but it's not horrible (though my Chromecast never did this, so it's not my wireless).You get Netflix, HBO Go, and many other apps as well, so it's pretty much the same as the Chromecast with the ability to show Amazon Prime shows and movies. The selection isn't as good as Netflix, but there are definitely shows on Amazon that Netflix does not have. The added ability to buy/rent shows or movies on the Fire TV Stick is a bonus.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Keith R.

This thing is a hunk of junk. Constantly crashing. The entire device crashes, each individual app crashes, it's a nightmare. Also it lags, along with repeatedly losing wifi connection. It's not my wifi because everything else in the house is connected. Got it only a few months ago and I want to replace it. The Roku was 10 times better than this, and I will go back to it now that I have experienced what type of technology Amazon has to offer.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Clarice Sanchez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was quite easy to install on my TV.

I read reviews so hopefully this might help someone.  I purchased it and I am extremely happy with it. Easy to install. I now have the means to easily scroll through Amazon prime movies. I have a smart tv but it would not load the Amazon software.i had to fumble through a mouse on my tv.  It's easy now. All the products they advertise (netflicks etc) you must pay for. That is never stated they only roll off all the products. It does provide easy access from one screen but they are not included. The remote is easy to use.
