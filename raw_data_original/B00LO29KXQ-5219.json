It is very easy to install and it is not bulky.Music: lots of free music. Pair it with a good sound system and you'll be having a great party. The pandora app is very good as well to pair with. The YouTube though needs development.Movies: a lot of free movies. There are also movies that can be purchased. It is more expensive than red box but comparable to comcast on demand. It is still cheaper than going to the movies so in the essence it is still cost effective compared to going to movie house.Overall, this is a great addition on the 2 day shipping of prime membership.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Harold"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product!
