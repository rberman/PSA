None of the apps work unless you already have cable under your own name and subscribe to that channel in which case why would you need to watch it through the Fire Stick?  I also can NOT use it to mirror my Kindle Fire on my TV which was the main reason I got it.  If it wasn't so cheap I would have sent it back.Maybe in the future there will be some decent apps for it, but right now it's just a Netflix and Amazon Prime device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles Mansfield"}]
