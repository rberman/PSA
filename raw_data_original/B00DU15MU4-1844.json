We have Iphone 6's, Ipad minis, and I use a Macbook PRO when I travel for business.  When shopping for a video streaming device, naturally I checked out the Apple TV first.  Unfortunately, due to Apple being a bit tight with the way Apple TV could play videos I already owned (AVI Files, stuff I've converted or ripped from DVD, etc) -- I had to look elsewhere.  Initially I tried to use the built-in \"SMART TV\" apps on my VIZIO televisions, but quickly realized that their software is garbage.  It would crash constantly, or fail to load from the PS3 Media server I had configured in my home office, or would hiccup constantly while watching movies.  I figured VIZIO would fix the problems with their code sooner or later, but after a year+ they never have addressed them.I ended up buying the Amazon Fire TV on Cyber Monday while the $69 sale was going on.  When the box showed up, it reminded me of an Apple product because it was a great presentation.  High quality box, limited docs, components nicely compartmentalized, and the device itself protected with a high quality plastic film.  This looked like a $300 product, and it definitely shows the effort Amazon is making to capture this market.  Right away I was pleased just holding the open box in my hands.Upon unboxing and setting it up, I was amazed at how easy it was.  Super fast too (especially compared to the apps on my \"SMART TV\") I simply plugged it in, and it worked first try.  It connected right away to my 5G Network (Which is a lot more than I can say about the IOS8 devices in our house right now - UGH!) -- There was a quick instructional video that played, and then I was off.  Since I bought it for streaming videos I already owned in AVI format, I immediately installed the PLEX APP, and put PLEX server on my PC.  Within minutes I was streaming movies to my TV from a computer in my home office.  I would say that VIZIO should just give up now and start bundling Amazon Fire TV's with their televisions, because they are never going to be able to compete with the speed, and quality of code that Amazon has packed into this little box.  The remote is even wireless and works through walls, so if I want to hide the box behind something, it would work without having to buy any additional accessories (Why Direct TV hasn't gone to this type of remote yet, I have no idea!?!?!)All in all I feel I got several hundred $$$ worth of value for the $69 I spent, and I would buy this device again in a heart beat.  I'm considering getting a few more for around the house so we can standardize our media streaming capabilities on a device that is faster and more reliable for the types of video streaming we like to do.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Carlton Davenport \"White Poet Warlord\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product.

I have 2 Apple TV's but I prefer the picture from this device.  One thing I find unusual though is:  Unfortunately, my cable provider COX does NOT like the device.  I get nasty emails from COX each month saying I have exceed the usage on my cable modem.  I know my online viewing has NOT increased, but I think this device downloads a higher quality stream than the Apple TV and so it uses more bandwidth.  Just a thought, but I have not been able to measure it.
