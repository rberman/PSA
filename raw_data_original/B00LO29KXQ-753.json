My husband and I are tired of the constant interruption of TV commercials.  The programming with the Fire stick is commercial free!2.  Our local cable provider has been a real disappointment for show access.  We tend to watch shows On Demand, but usually only the current season is shown or just the most recent episodes.  Who wants to get into a show on episode 10 of Season 3?  The programming with the Amazon Fire Stick has been great because we're able access amazing shows from Season 1, Episode 1.Another thing we really like about the Amazon Fire Stick is the included remote.  So many remotes require a 10 page instructional guide to operate.  Not this one.  It's simple, intuitive, and not loaded with mystery buttons.We like the Fire Stick in conjunction our Prime Membership so much, that we've decided to leave cable behind!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lorrie L.
