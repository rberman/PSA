[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Wow what a let down!  First, it took nearly a half hour to setup because it kept losing the network connection.  It dropped the connection 12 times in 30 minutes.  When I was finally able to login to my amazon account, everything was incredibly slow.  Bottom line, I have up in frustration before ever selecting anything to watch.  I boxed it back up and hooked up my roku 3 and within a minute I was watching a movie.  No disconnects, no slow loading, no hassle.  I only paid $25 for the fire stick and still feel ripped off.  Thank goodness I kept the receipt because it's going back.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Jeff S"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Hate it.  Excruciatingly slow to load ANYTHING. Very buggy. I have to press select and play simultaneously to restart it 2 or 3 times during the 15 minutes or so I am trying to use it before I give up and go back to regular tv.  Hulu Plus videos won't play. Most of the time it says the app doesn't exist (?).  So OK, I thought the Amazon prime videos and music would be more reliable. Nope. Haven't been able to watch any show or listen to any song without it hanging up and freezing halfway through/ $19 is cheap, if it works, but I feel like I have essentially flushed $19 down the toilet.

I would give five stars if Amazon didn't restrict apps to the Amazon App store and allowed Google Play as well or if there was a better way to search for Amazon Prime movies.  If you search for Christmas movies, for instance, you have to click through dozens of rental moves to find the very few Prime movies.  WIth what I'm paying for Prime membership, I should be able to see a list of only movies that I've already paid for.  Other than those two complaints, the product is great.  There are a lot of great movies included in Prime and several good apps where you can get additional content, even more by sideloading apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Us Here"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy set up.

If you are expecting a clean, non-intrusive list of \"channels\" such as ROKU provides, you will be sorely disappointed.I don't doubt that this will be great for a specific set of users, but it is not practical in our home where we have to monitor TV programs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Robert"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We got this as a deal for Amazon prime members and it is worth it. Would be worth it at regular price. We also have roku box and a chromecast stick and all have pros and cons. I have only used it a few times but will say setup was super easy and it definitely is more user friendly than chromecast.
