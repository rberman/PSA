I've been using Apple TV for years and it works fine for me but recently came across the sling.com/fire tv deal and figured I'd try it. My kids have been wanting a fire tv box for a few months since they discovered you can play games on it so we finally have one. So far I have nothing but positive things to say about this little box. Netflix - check, Sling - check, games - yes, voice commands, amazon video player, etc.. it works as advertised and feels solid. The remote controller also feels solid and well made. Nothing cheap or loose here. I'll give this things a few days/weeks and post another update.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "YM1967"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Goodbye cable", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "motoureop"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The options are great.

I wanted to save on my cable bill so I dumped the TV and added this.  The setup was very easy(I am not a big technology geek).  I like the apps that are available.  I did have to add a few of the TV/Movie services because I don't subscribe to Amazon Prime(there is a free month with the purchase but if you have ever had it, which I did, they will bill you without warning.  However, to their credit they refund rapidly also). That is the only downside to this that I can see is that it works best with Prime, which I may get in the future. It would be nice if they could do something monthly even if it is just for the movie/music content. If that happens then add the last star!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Justus"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pat Hinkle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "By far, the best device of its kind on the market.
