Easy to set up and easy to use.  I have joined Amazon Prime, and get extra free movies.  Those which are not free are very affordable.  Each time I use the Fire Stick I learn more about the set-up and see more of what is available thru this device, which is plenty.  Free shipping on all Amazon Prime products, a great deal.  I receive e-mails telling me what movies have been added to the free watching.  I highly recommend this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SueM."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Wish I had a stronger connection in home!
