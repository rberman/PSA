The remote is very intuitive and voice search is good but limited to Amazon based apps and products. Video streams super fast and I was able to use my Xbox 360 controllers to play games the device using a usb wireless connector. Overall a good product. Not as open as a chromecast but it has the chromecast beat on speed and storage.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Khalid Holmes"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The best \"break away from cable\" product for me.

I don't like not having an off function like apple. nor does it have control of resolution for low band width situations. the screen saver seems to take a lot of bandwidth to run, so I have to unplug it. it keeps saying loading????", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rodger Beaton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"julenelin\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This product would not work in the location where I installed it.  The reason was because my wifi signal was not strong enough.  After buffering for 30 seconds to a minute I received a notice on the screen that the signal was too weak.  I bought a wifi signal booster and it was not successful for this location.  I returned both the Amazon Fire TV and the wifi signal booster to Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Virginia Webb"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Really enjoy the fire tv.  I have other devices (Echo, Chromecast and Fire Stick).  The amazon devices are great because of the controllers and user interface.  The tv is good if you want a little extra speed/memory and most importantly a hard wired connection.  It also offers digital audio output so we are able to use it on a cheaper tv and still get the sound in high quality to our surround system.Biggest downside is the voice input. After having the Echo for a couple months, the voice commands and searching feels very limited on the fire tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cory"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great Device!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bozman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product, well constructed, very good attention to detail even on the packing.
