To top it off I ordered these as GIFTS, so why the hell are they linked to my account?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "loosewill"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Beware!Do not get fooled by the Fire Stick description given by Amazon.The device is NOT as described.1.Doesn't work with iOS.2.

Listed better than Google Chromecast and Roku, but those devices could beat this at any given day.Bought this for $25 on Prime Day Fail.
