I wanted to be able to watch Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime (no Amazon on Apple TV). It works ok. Sometimes it has a weird skipping quirk. It also loses the connection regularly  (we are in a 900 sq ft apartment) which could be the Internet provider but we didn't have nearly as much of a problem with the Apple TV.  Ultimately it is ok since this is just for the TV in our bedroom. However, if it was for our main TV I would probably try Amazon Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Crystal"}]
