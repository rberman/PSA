What I found is that, unless you want to watch Prime video, or plan to rent/buy streaming movies from Amazon, the Fire Stick is mostly unnecessary.  If it had better integration with Youtube, or if I could figure out how to load as many apps on it as Chromecast, I think it would be a solid contender for an HDMI port on my TV.  Instead, it seems like a way for Amazon to lock you into its rental/streaming services.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.
