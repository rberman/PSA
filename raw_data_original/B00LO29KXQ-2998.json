It is good for one person, not for a household with children.  The one big downfall is that there is no confirmation if you choose to watch a show that has a charge associated with it.  It would be helpful if you had to click on the actual dollar amount or if there was a confirmation pop up saying, do you really want to pay 2.99 to watch and episode of a program.  (parental controls does not have option for allowing purchases or not)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "shopper1"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I ordered my Firestick based upon the recommendation of a friend who RAVED about it.  I already have a Roku in my house, as well as a PS3 and PS4 and can stream the basic Netflix and Amazon content in a variety of ways.  I find the layout of the menu's of the Firestick to be more confusing than any of my other products.  As it is an Amazon product, it is geared to steer you towards Amazon content. If you want to venture off to Netflix or other areas it requires an \"app.\"  While it is easy enough to navigate, it is not as easy as other products that have no vested interest in giving preference to one vendor over another.The games included (its one advantage over Roku) are not too interesting and it is difficult to play them with the remote.  My remote also makes a loud clicking noise when ever a button is pressed which makes the remote feel kind of cheap.Overall it is a good product, but I don't think it is \"better\" than other options.  If you don't have any other options, I wouldn't hesitate to order it.  But don't replace a Roku or some other already functioning device because this isn't really much of an upgrade.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lundlover \"Moodydd\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It did more than add my expectations love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Erick"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "if there is a way to find categories of movie, I'd like to know.
