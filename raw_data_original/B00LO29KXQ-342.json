I wish I hadn't waited so long!  It is much faster and more reliable than the TV app.  I had read some comments about not finding the free Prime TV shows and movies.  These are already sorted for you so there is no trouble finding them right from the start screen.

Easy installation but it does require an ac power connection.  The remote is simple to use.  On-screen instructions for use are very good. Downloading apps is very straightforward.
