The one thing I did not like is the limited selection. I watch Netflix mostly, I don't like how the selection is limited and I can not search for movies and tv shows like on the web site.  I tried the free sign up for prime because I saw a show that I thought I would like but not all the seasons were free to view, also some of the other series on prime are limited to one season, when I know their is more then one. Over all they are good products well made, presented well, easy set up, shipping time was shorter then I though and amazon kept you informed all the way thought it. I prefer the stick for the versatility.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "chris"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "nice", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "crazyindiana"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very nice.

Bottom line the Fire TV streaming box works great and I like the voice command feature to search also!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dawn Passella"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Have not learned to take full advantage of all it does yet.
