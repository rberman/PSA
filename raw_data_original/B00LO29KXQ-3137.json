I would like a refund and return the product but it's past the return date-- I was waiting around hoping they would start including HBOGo but it never happened. I realize Roku has more functionality and options for alternative programming and will be buying one instead.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Raina Lee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "all it says it to be", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The fire stick is great for the money. However, there are some hiccups that I hope are addressed when a new version comes out.1. The remote is very cheap. The controls periodically stick and makes me fly by the program I wanted to select.2. When using Netflix, I often do not have the option to start a program from the beginning. If it's toward the end of a movie and I want to start from the beginning, I have to manually rewind it. It's fast - maybe 20 seconds - but frustrating.A huge improvement I've noticed over my older model Rokus is the fact that if you are watching a program, it will automatically start the next one. Great feature when one of your kids wants to watch a short children's program and you're trying to make dinner!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MP"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "After trying roku, google chromecast, apple tv, xbox, and a ps3, I'm finally settling on the Fire TV stick for the house. We mainly use netflix, youtube, and streams things on Plex. The biggest deciding factor was the remote. Its truly a pain in the neck to operate these sticks with a cell phone or ipad, and it's almost impossible to explain it to visitors. The apple TV doesn't play well with Plex, and forces you to load everything through iTunes.The Fire TV remote feels solid, and is simple enough that my mother in law can at least get to the you tube playlist when she's watching our toddler. The fire stick responds quickly and navigates menus smoothly. There are times when I have to reload Plex to see my shows, but otherwise I have had few glitches.I don't really use the search functionality or the games, so I can't comment on those things. They have a decent app store selection, particularly for cooking channels.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Wallace S"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's been good and clear.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Katie Mac"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We have both the Roku and this.
