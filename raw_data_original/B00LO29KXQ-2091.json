Good WiFi reception overall - tends to lag just a bit, but using the extension cable has helped a great deal. I have compared the picture quality of the stick vs. the box, and the box is definitely better on a large set, but for me and the 32\" set I am using - it's just fine.I have had 2 issues worth mentioning. My first stick had a defective remote where the navigation ring would stick - it was a local purchase and an easy exchange. The second deals with an Android Lollipop based smart phone... the app does not work. Not a defect or problem with this item, but worth mentioning if you are running into the same thing. The option to use your smartphone for a keyboard and voice command is really a nice feature.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.

The reason I gave it 4 stars and not five is that the organization of accessible content just escapes me. Amazon's \"genre,\" \"mood,\" \"theme,\" organization seems very oddly contrived.
