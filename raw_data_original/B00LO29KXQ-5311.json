We watch a lot of Amazon streaming movies and Netflix.  We noticed right away that the Fire TV Stick does not have the picture quality that the our Vizio Smart HD TV or Roku.  We have high speed internet, so it's not the internet speed.  We did like the ease of controlling the Fire TV via our Fire tablets.  Our next trial will be to take it with us when we travel and try to use it in a hotel, though I bet there will TVs).  This will probably drive down the cost of streaming devices, similar to the impact of the Fire HD driving down or at least containing the cost of tablets.Pro:  size, ability to control with Fire HD (easier to type titles from the virtual keyboards), Amazon linking to all devices, ease of installationCon:  picture quality is noticeably less than Roku or direct streaming from smart HD TV, comes directly linked to an account (I guess that might be a good thing for some people, but we find it an annoying assumption on Amazon's part)", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mary V.

This will NOT work on all HDTV's!  After spending two hours on the phone with Amazon trying to get two different sticks to work, I finally called Sharp Television.  They told me the Fire TV Stick requires MHL in order to work (Mobile High-Definition Link). Check out www.meetmhl.com for an explanation of what this is.  I had never heard of it prior to this issue.  I purchased my 52\" Sharp Aquos HDTV in 2009 prior to MHL existing.  It has plenty of extra HDMI ports.  Nowhere in the Fire TV Stick directions does it mention MHL is a requirement.  The Amazon reps obviously didn't know either.  I will have to \"stick\" with my Apple TV, which works great.  I was looking forward to the Amazon Stick too, as I am a Prime Member.  BTW - I purchased the Stick (and returned it!) at Staples for $24.99, much cheaper than Amazon itself.My biggest complaint is that the directions should mention this and customer support should know this also.
