I was already an Amazon Prime member which I used only for the free shipping. To have all these films and television show options available now is amazing and we are enjoying watching jazz concerts on YouTube. The possibilities seem endless at this point.I did have an issue in setting up Amazon Fire TV on my TV in the living room; it seems the HDMI 3 port on the Panasonic Viera might just be configured for a PC so I was unable to use it. The other HDMI ports are in use and are also behind the TV which is attached to the wall. Not sure if I can use the USB slot on the side of the TV instead, looking into that.But, I brought the Amazon Fire TV upstairs to the bedroom and set it up incredibly quickly. It's like having a movie theater in the room with so many other options, including listening the the music in our Amazon Cloud account and looking at our photos we've uploaded there as well. As the top review says, this is a game changer for us personally.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Roxanne"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A lot easier and fun to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "DIANA MEDINA"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "If you customer of Charter then you should not buy a Fire TV.  You are very limited in what services you can use due to the need to sign in with your cable provider for things such as Showtime Anytime, ESPN, and HBO GO... which Charter customers are not allowed access on this device.  I've heard Comcast customers have similar issues though I do not know how bad it is for them.  Other problems with the Fire TV is it's limited to 5gb of available storage with no way to expand it (even though there is a USB port on the back).  It's a shame because hardware wise this seems like the device to get.  However the fact that it is hinder with some provider issues and has limited storage are big concerns which make it hard to recommend this to people.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/4", "author": "Don"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "should have bought a ROKU  Fire unit gives an error message that my network is too slow.
