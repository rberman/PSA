We tried the chromecast first and were totally frustrated with it.  The separate remote that is provided by FireTV Stick makes life easy.

I could only get it to work if within 15- 20 ft (with and without the extender) of the router. Not functional in a house. I had purchased the stick to add the Fire TV in the master bedroom. I would not recommend this item if you want something that works well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "kak1002 \"Kristin King\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have a fire TV and a fire TV stick.
