However, I recently upgraded a 2nd TV to a 50\" Plasma.  My son wanted to watch \"Frosty\" and \"Mr. Grinch\" on the new TV, but since both were part of my iTunes Library, I could not easily stream them to the new Plasma.  Now that I have this unit hooked up to the Plasma, streaming is perfect.  Of course, it all depends on your Internet Connection, but it's nice to stream 1080p content directly from the Apple Servers to this device with no lags or loss in picture quality.Setup is a breeze.  All I had to do was select my preferred language, enter my Apple ID and Password and all my iTunes content was available.

Setup was a breeze, and picture quality is also excellent, with hardly any need for buffering, but that can be due to cable usage in my neighborhood, or something else not necessarily the fault of the Apple TV.  Anyway, Apple needs to add more content, as I'm sure they eventually will, since Netflix (and Hulu Plus, if you so desire) are the only things worthwhile to me so far.  Yes, you can subscribe to sports programming but I'm not interested in those, and YouTube's quality varies immensely.  You can also play music from your computer (provided your computer is a recent model, and your OS is newer) to your stereo but I don't see the point of playing a low-fidelity medium on a high-fidelity system, and photos can also be streamed directly to your television.  All in all, a great product, albeit, limited in variety, so far.  However, if you subscribe to Netflix for its streaming then it is worth it for that alone.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Real Music-Not Rap"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I chose this so that I could play my movies and music through my sound system easily.

I may be a little daft, but I can't always get it to play from my computer or ipad. Anyway, I think my boyfriend (who is very tech savvy) has figured it out (after quite a bit of effort).

There's like millions of movies and shows to choose from. But you do have to rent or purchase certain movies. For example: If you purchase nexflix for $8.00 a month you'll get to choose from hundreds if not thousands of movies and tv shows. Then there's another I think 15-20 more apps on there. You tube is free, I've only used it for about an hour so I can't tell you too much.
