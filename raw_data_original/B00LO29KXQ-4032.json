We were looking forward to using this device but we are now returning it...Unfortunately, the parental controls that apply to all of the other devices registered to our Prime account do not apply to the FireStick. If your parental controls are ON, you have to input a PIN for for every single thing you watch (including animated children's programs) and if you turn parental controls OFF, there is complete access to mature content programming. This is not a mistake that Apple would have made before rolling out a product like this and, frankly, I'm a very disappointed customer...Amazon usually hits it out of the park, but this time, I'm calling FOUL BALL!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amanda Love"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Shipped quick and just as described.
