[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I Really like it! Very easy and convenient set up. Arrived the next day. One suggestion: its convenient to stream, but on the free apps, the programs offered are mostly snippets, not the full program, and full episodes are more desirable!

I have NEVER had a problem.  I got a new puppy that chewed one of my remotes so I thought I would give the Fire stick a chance.  This item is horrible!  It skips and skips.  The longer you watch tv, the more it skips.  It gets so bad that it resets itself.  Save yourself a headache and just spend a few dollars more and get a ROKU!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jane"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I already have a NETFLIX viewing agreement and bought this to view NETFLIX on my big TV via wifi, but after connecting to the internet,, I could not access it using the firestick link. I shoud have had a sign in prompt but none was there with no way to access NETFLIX.

If you do not have a close AC outlet to the back of the TV, you may need an extension cord to connect the power cable of the Fire TV stick.
