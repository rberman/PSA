I own this and a chromecast and this doesnt even come close to the quality and consistency of the chromecast.  I connect to both via an HDMI port and the Fire Stick loses the internet connection probably once every five minutes.  When it does connect to the internet it says that it did so with problems.Maybe my equipment is damaged, maybe.  I did send an email but got some 2 page response about i dont know what.  I was too tired to read it all.I have yet to try the roku but if your choices are between a Chromecast and a Firestick dont even think about it twice and go with the Chromecast.  Yes, it is true that with the Fire Stick you can stream amazon shows but what good is it if it cannot connect to the internet on a consistent basis.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "MELISSA CORREA"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have only had it for a couple of days. But I want people to know that it does work with a 1.5 MB download speed. I was concerned that it would not work with such a slow internet connection, but it does work. It only showed buffering the first time I tried it and then it started to play with no buffering. I am impressed with that. That seems like a very good sign. after I use it for a little while more, I will post an update.
