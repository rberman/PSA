Easy setup, great picture and selection of apps. I use it only for TV and movies, so I can't comment on using it for games.

Easiest possible set-up imaginable.  Voice search is accurate and huge time saver.  More intuitive controls and searching than other set-top boxes.  Combine with Amazon Prime Membership for huge inventory of free streaming.

I don't have to keep my laptop tethered to my tv anymore. There are also multiple apps that allow me to stream downloaded content from my laptop to my tv without uploading it to cloud storage. It performs well and offers plenty of content to keep me entertained. I'm very happy with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "RiverQuinn"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Quick and easy setup.

Morales"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I absolutely LOVE my Amazon Fire Tv,I love the SPEED of how fast the icons and interface moves,and the Fact that the remote is Bluetooth powered can't be understated!! Being able to use the remote without having to point it directly at the unit is so convenient!!,And did i mention this thing is fast?? I zip through rows of content and scroll through movie titles without hiccups or freezes.All the Tech specs you see on This unit about being faster then the other players is NOT Marketing Hype you can tell once you start using it.I Dont have any complaints to speak of,For the time being in my opinion Amazon Fire Tv is the KING of Steaming media Players.What it all boils down to is no one player will please everybody some might put the Roku 3 Ahead of this player simply for the fact that the R3 Has More channels then the Fire Tv but to ME i don't care about that because all i watch on my Fire Tv is Netflix anyway but to each it's own.What i will say is if you're looking for a Solid Steaming player with great picture,sound,Speed and lil great quirks like a Bluetooth remote and Voice Search and the gaming capabilities with a REAL controler then you CANNOT GO WRONG BUYING A FIRE TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/5", "author": "Justin Bolling"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For someone who doesnt have a Smart HDTV, This is perfect, just wish my kids had not lost the control... or Amazon should make a remote control app for smart phones.
