The remote is great and the browsing experience is pretty good.  App selection is pretty good and loading apps is really easy.The only problems that I have had are the occasional audio glitch during playback and that the Fire Stick sometimes loses or forgets the wireless connection/password when waking from sleep mode.  The wireless problem is really annoying when it happens (3 times in the first week of use), and is the reason I knocked the rating down. Hopefully, both of these issues can be fixed in a future software update.The one feature that I really find myself missing is the screencasting ability.  Hopefully, this is a feature that will be released in the future.Overall, I'm really happy with the Fire Stick so far, and would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good, cost effective solution for streaming.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adam D."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love it.
