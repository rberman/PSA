It performs well for everything but.. Constantly re buffering, and slow and spotty. Claims my internet speed is to slow. I have blazing fast speed and never have the problem on my Apple TV or roku. It could be mlb app problem or Amazon. I have read lots of people having the problem. Works great on everything else. If you have Comcast you won't get HBO to go. I am a prime member and enjoy all other features. I do however have the Fire T V on my big screen and there is no problem with it on MLB. So if you want to stream baseball get the Fire T V foe 99.00. Or apple t v for 69.00.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "R.S.CASTORANI"}]
