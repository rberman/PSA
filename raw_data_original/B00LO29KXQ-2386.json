One day I noticed some playback issues with the Netflix app. Next it was the occasional dropped connection from my home WiFi network. No biggie, I can live with that once in a while. But it once in a while quickly became all the time. Now it either won't connect at all, or it connects just long enough to load the home screen, then disconnects again before I can launch anything.It's worth mentioning that I've made no recent changes to my WiFi network, and no other device in our household has any difficulty staying connected (computers, iPads, smartphones, Xbox, etc.). Also, I've tried numerous reboots, uninstalling apps, manually clearing the cache, and even resetting the device to factory defaults, but nothing helps.As I said, it's currently useless. I would ask for my money back, but the thing lasted just long enough for my window of return to expire. It is, however, still under warranty, so I'm hoping Amazon will at least send me a replacement. Hopefully I just got a dud and the next one will be okay. I have an email out to Amazon Customer Service, and plan on updating this review to include what they say / do about the matter.Again, for what it's worth, I really did like it when it was working.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Geoff"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works great, the remote is kind of unresponsive sometimes, but it's not a huge problem.
