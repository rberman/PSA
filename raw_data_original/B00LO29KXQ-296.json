It has ESPN 1, 2, 3, ESPN U and the SEC. It also has Pandora and Crackle, expanding the availability of the things I use the most. Great selection and since I'm a Prime member I also get all of those movies. AND I didn't realize I could see TV shows in HD surround with no commercials so I can watch whenever I want to! Excellent product! Enables me to use this in my shop wireless where I had been unable to view these features and programs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Norbert Neel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use and love the remote.
