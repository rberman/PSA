The menus are easy to find and very fast.  Once the program is selected, the video starts very quickly.  The picture quality is very good.  I was a little nervous buying a box dedicated to streaming when for the same price I could have bought a blu-ray player with streaming.  But this little box excels at the entire streaming experience.  Paired it with AmazonBasic HDMI cable, easy setup and picture quality.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael J.

Ecept they are just the music, NO video. Went back and it may be that I don't select the one click shopping, I can't even see the small print that says \"Buy for $2.99\" an episode so do not want that option. Apparently you can choose but they want you to buy to see. Really poor  free Prime music video selection anyway.  Also the Closer series sudden;y disappeared and when I went to watch it wantedme to purchase the episode. If I had one touch I would have accidently bought and there is like NO direct customer service. No one is responsible. Strange company and they can't make money yet, could be customer service is worse than Comcast and that is not nice at all. When my membership is done I will spend my funds elsewhere.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "David d peterson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works great. very happy with the fire tv and glad to be rid of the local cable company :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JR"}]
