[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic so far. I've had it for just a few weeks and the convenience of not having to wait for my Xbox to power up and be ready is worth the price itself, not to mention reducing the wear and tear of always having the game console powered on.So far no dreaded buffering, which I wondered about due to the WiFi only connection, I have Verizon Fios and the Fire Stick is only a few feet from my router.Using this with the included remote is a great cost-effective way to access content without killing your game console(s), and it's way more convenient as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mark S.
