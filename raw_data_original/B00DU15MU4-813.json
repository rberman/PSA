I think the reception is better than I got with the Roku\u2026but\u2026.it is almost impossible to navigate with the remote. The voice feature is great, except when you realize that you only get Amazon results and not Hulu, (sometimes I want to watch yesterday\u2019s episode not last years). For the most part that is all I watch \u2013 Amazon or Hulu and the remote won\u2019t take me back to the home Hulu screen but will stay on the show I decided I don\u2019t want to watch, or go into a show that I am not interested in watching. It is frustrating spending so much time looking for a show on Hulu and then being scared you have seen all the episodes, as you know you won\u2019t be able to get out of it once you arrive!Maybe there is a simple answer to this problem \u2013 if there is I would be happy to hear it because this really is a five star product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "JA"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my fire TV!
