Unfortunately for me I gave my Roku's away when I purchased these because of how awesome the hard wired Amazon Fire TV is - now I'm looking at buying some new Roku's - Amazon has the right-idea but lacking the technology with these - also boxed remote has no talk and text feature like the hard-wired model.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scarlette King"}]
