Tried a voice search within Youtube and it redirected me to the Instant Video app offering to let me buy what I was searching for.  The voice search has great potential but the redirects to Amazon \"buy this now\" areas are maddening.  Got this as a gift or I would have returned it.  Hey, I love Amazon.  I have a Kindle for reading and 2 Fire HDX's for my family.  Sad that this device needs high speed internet. The Fire HDX lets you pre-download if your connection is slow.  Not this device.  It tells you your connection is slow and offers no help.  Have updated the firmware and it got a little better.  Here's hoping the next firmware fixes things, I'd be happy to up my rating!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "E. Coughlin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I LOVE IT! ITS AMAZING!
