I received this item today and it was not at all what I expected. :-(  Everything was connected correctly and it did search and find my wifi network, then did an update.  After everything loaded and I clicked on a couple of movies.  The quality was not good at all.  I also tried a couple of Tv shows and again the quality was not good.  It was fuzzy/out of focus.  I get a much better picture on my Chromebook which is connected to my HDTV.  Everything is always clear.  I don't like to complain, but I also don't like getting something that is not what I thought it would be.The best part of the whole situation is how well Customer Service handled my return and refund all in the same day which is today, the same day I received the Fire Tv Stick.  They have already credited the $34 back to my debit card.  That is awesome service.  The also sent me a prepaid label to send it back at no charge to me.  UPS will be here to pick up the return tomorrow.  I can't say enough good things about Amazon Customer Service.  They are amazing.  The entire process was handled through email.  Way To Go Amazon!  Thank You!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "HeartsGirl"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I bought it because of a special offer the picture continuously breaks up and lags.

I don't have to plug a cable from my laptop to my TV anymore to be able to watch programs and movies on the big screen !  Thank you Amazon !  It streams fast, never loses signal and it is so inexpensive.

Streaming video or music it was very poor. My connection speed download is 30mb/s and the fire tv stick had all the bars and described the connection as Very Good. My Kindle FiireHDX plays thru it using the mirror mode without a flaw.  But just using the stick, it's buffer and more buffer every 2 or 3 minutes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard HOpe"}]
