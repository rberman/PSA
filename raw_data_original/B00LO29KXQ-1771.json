[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I've had this for about six months now and it's just gotten worse.  I use it every day mostly for Netflix and Hulu, but have also used Pandora.  I'm officially sick of the freezing, crashing and general complete unreliability of this thing. Hulu is the worst, but Netflix and Pandora also skip and have interruptions in the content. And it's not my internet connection. When I watch Netflix shows on my wireless Blu Ray player, the content plays seamlessly.I'm glad I didn't spend much money on this stupid stick. I don't expect the Fire TV box to be any better so I guess I'm going to Apple TV. **sigh***", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "discofan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome, works better than the smart blu-ray player I bought for another TV, doesn't buffer in mid movie.
