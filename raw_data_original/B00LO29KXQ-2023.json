I considered getting a chromecast but I love the fact that with this you can still interact with your tv as a standalone device with the remote. Between prime video, netflix, and the pbs app, I rarely if ever watch live tv.

I also love Amazon! However, I find that this stick sometimes has a hard time staying connected to the network. Also, it does not do well when I try to go back to Netflix because it always makes me log back in again (could be a problem with Netflix, but either way my watch time is lessened). I still like it and use it often.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Great little device. I've had it for about a month now. The small device can't handle getting a little warm, because there is no way to turn it off without unplugging it. Once it is hot it gets very laggy and the video has a hard time keeping up. Unplug it, wait a few minutes, plug it back in and it work fine for awhile...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nic Olson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fifteen minutes after the FIRESTICK arrived I was watching some great programs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "emily himelstein"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The fire TV stick works as advertised. It provides a cheaper alternative to steam apps on a TV. I used my Xbox360 to stream video, but lately has stopped working correctly. I chose the fire TV stick because of the reviews not only on Amazon, but all over the internet. Great price and performance.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rob"}]
