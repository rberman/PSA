I love it so far.\u2022 It is tiny, what a delight!\u2022 Easy to set up, and it connected easily with our wireless internet.\u2022 Voice command on the remote works well.\u2022 It turns itself off after it hasn't been used after period of time.\u2022 Clear perfect picture and auto transmission.We already have Amazon Prime, kindle readers and a kindle fire HDX.  I have used the fire HDX to watch movies and tv shows for a year.\u2022 Many reviewers have commented on the difficulties with knowing which programming is flagged as \"Prime\", and there for free, when scrolling on the fire tv.  What I found works for us, is to research what we want to watch, (movie or tv show), on the kindle fire HDX then use the voice search to pull up the show you want directly on the fire tv.  It is much easier to tell what is free prime programing on the kindle fire versus the way the prime labelling is on the fire tv.We haven't tried the gaming features yet.We're very very happy with the purchase of the fire tv.Can't wait for a Amazon automatic cooker and dishwasher to be developed.  ;)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Forrest & Lynn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If there were a sixth star I would add it.Somehow in a world where all the technology leaves me looking for the instruction manual (no longer provided) this item seems to think the way I do.
