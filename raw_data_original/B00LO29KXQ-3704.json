The Fire Stick is excellent if you want to find content through the FireTV interface, but if you're looking to cast YouTube or Netflix or other apps from your phone, I find the Chromecast gives a better user experience.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joshua Dobbins"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "excellent!
