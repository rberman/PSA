For me the easier to set something up the better. This really is plug and play and is very easy to use. My mom has cable internet so no issues with buffering. She uses it to watch netflix and prime and does not use the other features. I also purchased a USB power adapter that is sold on Amazon so that I would not have to run another power cord from her TV. Good product. To be honest I think this ought to come with the USB power cord just so it is more tidy to set up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David L.
