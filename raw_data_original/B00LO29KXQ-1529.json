This week number 5, it randomly does not wake when turning on. I have to reboot the stick and it works well for a while. Now I am 5 days past the final return date. Amazon says, call for warranty information. I wished I would have purchased the Fire TV although Amazon and Vudu don\u2019t want to play together.Stick is still VERY FAST browsing Amazon stuff. Netflix and Flixster are slow responding. Flixster is my Vudu replacement.

I do however RECOMMEND that Amazon get their shipping up to par.  I was not impressed with the supposedly 2 day shipping of my order,  instead it took 4 days. This is when I also ordered prime for a 30 day trial.
