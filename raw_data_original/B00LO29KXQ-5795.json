Side-loads XBMC (Kodi) flawlessly, and appears to work just as well as the (far more expensive) original FireTV.  The remote is missing the voice recognition functionality of its big brother, but is otherwise fantastic.  I played with the remote control app a bit, and it works exactly as advertised, and setup is a breeze.  Amazon hit a home run with this one...and at $20 for pre-orders, it's almost TOO cheap!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Odin the Dog"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "this works great for streaming show and very easy to move from one tv to another..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Raul Mendoza"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome and now my child wants one for her room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Howard B.

Amazon did not make it clear though that it is NOT just a USB stick that you plug in however, it requires a power cord and is slightly bulkier than it looks (it's power cord blocks a HDMI port on my TV).  Other than that, however, it does work quite well.UPDATE after using the device for two months.  It constantly stops working and I have to either unplug it/plug it back in, and three times it \"forgot\" my Netflix information while keeping everything else.  I messaged Amazon and they offered me a refund, which is nice, but I'd rather them fix their product.  I no longer think it was worth bothering with.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer \"xlance\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It gave me a little trouble at first - for the first few days it wouldn't connect to wifi, but now that it's working I love it.

The first one installed very easily, all I really had to do was sign in and download my apps. The second one however, was a real pain. After it couldn't update for a few days I had to exchange it for a new one at Best Buy (don't get me started on how long it to them to locate another one). I am please with my purchase though. This stick gives more viewing options in rooms where there are no cable outlets plus I have the lowest cable package so it's nice to have a wider selection of entertainment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lauren Johnson"}]
