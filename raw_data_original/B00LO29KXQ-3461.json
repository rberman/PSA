The Amazon Fire TV Stick works better than I had previously hoped it would.  I like how everything is integrated into one Menu System.  Its easy to switch between Prime, Hulu, Netflix and other applications.  I am about 1 month into Cutting the Cord and this has made it much easier to be able to gather all of these applications into one Menu.  Also the fact that I can quickly surf my Amazon Prime queue and Movies I have purchased makes this even better.  The Fire Stick does not come with Voice Control via the included remote, but you can download a Controller App and the Voice Control works extremely well if you want that feature but do not want to purchase the FireTV.  I am planning on getting a FireTV for the other TV in the house.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David Johnston"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought many of this for my family \ud83d\udc6a & friends.excellent product with sideloaded xbmc\ud83d\ude03", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SS"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ma Ruwena Sevilla"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was easy to install.
