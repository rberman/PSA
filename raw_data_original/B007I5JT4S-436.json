We actually have four of them across the various generations.  The Apple TV is one of many largely comparable products.  If you have any recent Apple products (iPhones, iPad, iTunes movies, etc.) and are looking for a fan free (i.e., absolutely silent), energy efficient box to plug into your TV to see a diversity of media, then this might be the purchase you are looking for.  If you are not invested much or at all into the Apple ecosystem, The Roku 3 is better.  In some ways, the Roku 3 is better (e.g., it has more channels, particularly Amazon Instant Videos), but the two are largely comparable.  To some degree, the real question is whether you want access to iTunes and airplay on the AppleTv or Amazon videos and more channels on the Roku 3.  Trust your gut on which you should buy, but buy own of them.

Excellent little device, with the combination of airplay, itunes and apps such as netflix and crackle, I only watch cable for the live events; NFL, MLB, WWE, etc. With WWE hitting hulu and the mlb app on this device, I see the chord cutting in the near future!*Sadly, you cannot jailbreak this device, this is why the cost of the AppleTV 2 is 150% more than this.The ability to use airplay on this device is what sold me to this instead of the roku, the lack of amazon prime is no big deal with having airplay to link the prime app on the ipad to the TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ryan R."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I got Apple TV as a gift for Xmas this year.  It is a great little box.  Very sleek looking, uses little power, and integrates with all your iPhones and iPads.  The quality of the video is awesome.  Mine is streaming over 5ghz wifi without a hitch.  Perhaps those that complain about video quality do not have the proper router.  Regardless, mine streams perfectly.Here is why this works for me: I subscribe to DirecTV.  I have two set-top boxes (one in the family room and one in the living room).  Each of those TVs also has an Xbox 360 and a blue ray player attached.  The TV in my bedroom has no set-top box, no 360, and no DVD player.  It simply pulls in beautiful free HD over the air.  Enter Santa and my Apple TV.All in all I am happy with the unit.  The Netflix app is not as user friendly as the Xbox app, however, it gets the job done.  I like that I can pull content from iTunes and or my networked computer.  Air Play is really cool.  Where it is lacking is APPS!  I would like Flixster, Amazon Prime, and just more content.  I will use ESPN, MLB, NETFLIX, and the Disney apps when the kids come in and snuggle with my wife and I on the weekends.I like the unit and am glad Santa brought it.  However, it may not work for your specific needs.  The Roku may be more of what you are looking for.  They need to crank out more apps!UPDATE 1/6/2014:I bought a Roku 3 as well.  Both are great boxes but I think I actually prefer the Apple TV.  I ordered another unit and just canceled Direct TV.  I have the best of both the Roku and Apple TV.  Prefer the Apple TV for the integration with my iDevices and AirPlay.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "K.

If you want iTunes, get this.A recent software update made Netflix look awful on the Apple TV, but they seem to have fixed that. I have a Chromecast as backup and comparing the two you could see the difference. Fortunately, it works much better now and it's so much easier to have a remote control than using my iPhone with the Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hisashi T.

I love being able to mirror my IOS device (iphone, ipad) screen up on to the TV to share pictures, videos, web pages, etc.  It's especially great for doing face time between my kids and their grandparents.  It's like a business video conference with the display and audio coming through a  55\" or 42\" TV.  The iphone or ipad essentially become the video camera.  Last, after living through several generations of media (VHS, LD, DVD, Blu Ray) for movies, I've given up and moved to download them.  The Apple TV works great for streaming them.  Apple continues to add new functionality and sources for media.

However, comparing with Google's equivalent ChromeCast, which costs only $35, Apple TV is way too expensive, as ChromeCast works nearly exactly the same except it does not has an fiber optic audio output, and it does not have an extra remote control (which is not exactly necessary as your mobile device takes the job).Setting up Apple TV is a little tedious, not as easy as ChromeCast.$50 is a much more reasonable price for Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.
