[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Purchased this as a replacement for an older Roku model--extremely fast compared to what I was accustomed to.  Love that it comes with a remote (as opposed to Roku/Chrome).

I figured with new tech it'd work better, but this is just... awful.  It doesn't achieve or hold an internet signal in rooms where every other wifi tech I have, connects just fine.  I'm extremely disappointed with this.  It will be unlikely that I purchase another one, or even an actual Fire TV.  Which is very unfortunate since I tend to support amazon a great deal.  All they needed to do was give it some good wifi technology.  Amazon fail.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "aperfectsircle"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "My biggest gripe abouut this item is that it doesnt have volume control.
