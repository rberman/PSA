[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "this is an awesome device. We don't have cable so rely solely on Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu for our programs. This device brings all those apps plus more right to our TV. We loved it so much we got one for each TV in our home. I love the parental controls which keeps our kids from purchasing things and also blocks content we don't want them to have access to.
