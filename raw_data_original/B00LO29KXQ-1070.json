[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "Being an Amazon Prime member, I saw the Fire TV Stick as a great opportunity to finally cut the cord on cable/satellite. I signed on to Netflix as way to enhance viewing options. While I didn't encounter as many issues of buffering and cutting out with Prime viewing, I did have quite a few of them with some of the other apps, including Netflix. I upped my internet speed from my ISP and  purchased a WiFi extender with hopes of correcting the problem yet still had issues. I even considered purchasing a new router to see if that would help. I was to the point of thinking I was premature on the idea that it was possible to cut the cord at this time. However, I decided to try a Roku 2 to see if that made a difference. It made ALL the difference!! The Roku did not buffer or cut out once, not once. The Fire TV box may be a better alternative to the Fire TV stick if you want to stick with Amazon products. As for me, I will be purchasing additional Rokus  for the additional TVs in my home. Roku offers many more channels and the ability to watch an entire program without buffering. Plus the cost comparison makes Roku 2 even more attractive:Fire TV Stick $39.99, Roku 2 $59.99, and Fire TV box $99.99. I really wanted to like the stick because there are no visual cords but the Roku box is much smaller than I expected. I cannot address the Roku Stick since I have not tried it.\u00a0Roku 2 Streaming Media Player (4210R) with Faster Processor (2015 model)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "psat"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Amazon Fire Stick is perfect for me to watch my Amazon Prime Instant movies.

When you type, clicking the right button makes it go down half the time, the other half, it goes up. Clicking in the center which is usually enter...well it chooses which direction it wants to go. You get my point. I still haven't gotten the first letter entered correctly in 20 minutes.

I use it every single day in a room where I do not have a cable box. It has been very reliable and fast. The picture is crisp and clear. I have had some buffering issues on netflix, but nothing serious and nothing that bothers me enough to complain.
