[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far, it's exactly what I was expecting.  I do see some lag when scrolling through, hence the 4 star rating, but for the price, I'm willing to deal with that.  It's not a horrible lag, but it's noticable.  Intended use is on an extra tv, one that's a distance from our router, yet it picks up signal and plays well.  I'm happy with my purchase so far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cziggy13"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was lucky enough to secure a Fire TV Stick in the pre-order phase for $19.  I figured for $19, I cant go wrong.  I got it on Thursday and connected it right away.  I must say I am truly impressed.  I figured it would be good, but my expectations were exceeded.  Once setup its fast and the app selection is great.  Ive always heard that Amazon Prime videos load quickly on the original Fire TV, but I was not expecting what I say.  I press play and the videos start almost immediately.  I used to primarily watch streaming videos on Netflix, which of course is supported, but if I now have the opportunity to watch a video on Netflix or Amazon Prime, I will definetely choose Prime. I havent tried too much apps, but what I have worked great, including the aforementioned Netflix.One of the fist apps I did install was Plex.  I had previously purchased it with the Amazon Appstore and its working flawlessly.  I tried a couple of games, and they worked, but they would probably be much better with the Fire Game Controller.  Im actually considering purchasing it.  I have a Chromecast connected to one of my TVs and the Fire TV Stick will be replacing it.  Dont get me wrong, the Chromecast is good too, but the Fire TV just seems so much faster and I love the fact that it has its own remote and doesnt rely on pushing content to it from a phone, tablet, or computer.For $19, the Fire TV Stick was a steal.  Even at $39 its going to be a great bargain.  I can see myself buying 2 or 3 more for other rooms.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "JohnnyDanger"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's amazing, so many features.

As the owner of two of the more expensive Fire TV's, I was impressed with the performance of the Fire TV Stick.  It installed, upgraded and configured itself flawlessly.  I noticed no difference in responsiveness or viewing quality when viewing movies despite it having 2gb less RAM than the Fire TV.  Not being a gamer, I have no comments regarding its gaming performance.  I was fortunate to have the opportunity to pre-order two of these devices at half price.  I have 3 different Roku models and 1 Apple TV2.  None of these other streaming devices come close to the Fire TV or Fire TV Stick in performance or value. The only downside to the Fire TV & Fire TV Stick is that it does not place an icon on the home screen for user added applications.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BobbyRed"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great.

It is easy to access.  But the UI takes a little getting used to and doesn't seem too well thought out.  Or maybe I just haven't learned the UI well enough which would then suggest that it is not intuitive enough.  I wind up running the same searches through multiple services or \"apps\".  I want to find and watch a movie but I don't know if it's on Amazon Prime, Netflix or ShowTime.  Maybe there's a universal search but it doesn't jump out at you.I like the access to my music, too, but I wish Amazon would allow me to sync through OneDrive and my home network rather than through Amazon Cloud Player.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark \"Esoth\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have Amazon Fire TV on my 60 inch TV.
