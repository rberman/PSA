We are able to see many interesting \"partials\" of dozens of documentaries, films and TV shows. We really enjoy seeing one to three minutes of an hour-long documentary, so obviously it suits us. An added bonus is that the menu is diabolical; one cannot get back to the main menu of a channel at all. You have to uninstall and reinstall the whole system to get back to each menu every single time. But yes, good apart from that.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "F. C.

I am deaf and since netflix also has no captions we were hoping the fire stick would provide captioning.  Set up was fairly easy and the movie list is impressive.
