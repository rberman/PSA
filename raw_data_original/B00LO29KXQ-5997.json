[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I expected this device to be glitchy at first and boy was it. I have to manually restart it by unplugging and plugging it back in because it freezes so much. The device will also get stuck in scroll mode and never stop, thus causing a reboot. The device also loses network connection randomly. So far I'm waiting on firmware updates to fix these issues.Aside from the glitches,setup was relatively smooth. It asked for my wifi credentials twice and took about 20 minutes from initial boot up to browsing due to system updates and installs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Johanna Kessel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was very hesitant to get this. I already have a Chromecast and nexus player, but since it was so cheap and I have Prime I decided to give it a try. Definitely happy with that decision.

Faster, sleeker, and easier to use than Roku or Chromecast.  I love the sleek remote and ease of use.  I also like the flat wall plug-in.  The program is more intuitive than the others.I like the screensavers too!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A. Owings"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Arrived early. Very well packaged. Easy to install. Had to temporarily remove power to facilitate its software update after I signed on.I find the remote a little awkward to use, maybe because I'm used to my Roku remote. Surprisingly, it displays at 1080p on my 720p TV. I hope that doesn't cause a problem.Beyond that, the Fire TV Stick works fine, and is very responsive. But my experience using it is limited to watching one older movie \"Lifeboat,\"  since I just received my unit.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marty O'Boyle"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "An ok product.
