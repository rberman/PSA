[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I've been wanting this for ever and finally purchased it. Well, I got it and it kept disconnecting to my internet which is through AT&T.; After resetting it numerous times with is still not working, I decided to call Amazon. After a few min with them, the rep told me that AT&T; internet does not work with the Fire Stick and to get it to work, I would have to us it during non-peek times like early mornings, weekdays, mostly all the times that I am at work and cant use it either. So, I have this Fire Stick and can't use it because I have AT&T.; Future customers, if you have AT&T; as your internet provider, know that it will probably not work when you want it. I think it's a cool item just wish I could use it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rita"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "it is super easy and AWWWWWWSOME!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "siouxzanne \"siouxzanne\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "works fine", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hugh E.

In addition with the current trends in TV programming, I an able to watch programs/movies which are much more to my liking.  Cheap entertainment.  Hour-long shows are seen in 42 minutes.
