[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Cons:1.  Installing the batteries in the remote was somewhat difficult.  However, googling the issue revealed that you just need to push really hard on the indicated spot on the back of the remote to open it (Amazon does e-z open packaging; would be great to have a way to more easily open the battery compartment).2.  Received a \"low power\" message when plugged into the USB port of the LG HDTV; however, it still worked fine and when I unplugged it from the USB port it powered off, so it's working anyway.3.  Voice searching only covers the Prime videos, not Netflix etc.Pros:1.  Very fast interface - don't take this for granted as slow interfaces are real killjoys.2.  Great phone app IMO - the \"touchscreen\" concept with swiping works well and is helpful.3.  Voice searching feature really speeds up searching, although would be better if it searched the entire universe of apps on the stick.  I have a Tivo, and it's very helpful to search for a show and see all the places it's available.  Also, it would be better if the Fire stick had more particular searching (i.e., The Wire, Season 2, Episode 7 etc.)4.  Setup was relatively easy and no issues with wireless connection for me.5.  Portable - I can see bringing this on trips to other people's houses or hotels could be really great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Trivia Hunter"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick was a hit on our holiday retreat. We were visiting our relative's house and I brought the Fire TV Stick with us to hook up to their TV.  The set up was as easy as putting into an open HDMI connection on TV and connecting to their Wifi from the menu.  Instantly, the room was filled with entertainment from Prime and Netflix movies and tv shows for the kids, Pandora music while we were eating, and YouTube videos on the TV screen.  Having the Fire TV Stick was really a game changer in providing free and exciting entertainment content which livened up our holiday retreat.Pros: instant entertainment, ability to also use Pandora, Netflix, YouTube and many other Apps through the TV.  Easy to use remote and iPhone app to use in place of the remote.  Fast and instant viewing of content.Cons: works better if you use the supplemental power supply in addition to hooking up to HDMI connection.  Would be ideal if you could just hook up to HDMI without also needing a power supply (outlet) nearby.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DMS NYC"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Nice App playing for the price I got to buy early. You do have to wait through the entire setup can't skip anything that is kind of annoying otherwise the menu seems clear so far.

My TV is located close to the router so I have yet to experience any problems with the connection.  It is easy to set up and easy to use.June 2015.  I have a second Fire Stick - a gift from the people at Sling TV - and it is located in my kitchen which is not next to my router.  This unit does not work as well as the other one.  Not nearly as well.  My Roku functions just fine in that location as does my laptop so it is not a connection problem.  If I had paid for this Fire Stick I would have returned it.  I really think that the Rokus are a better choice.August 2015.  Swapped the Fire Stick in my kitchen for the Roku on the living room tv.  There are just not enough apps available for the Fire Stick.  I am a Tennis Channel fan and the app is not available on the Fire Stick.  A lot of apps are not available on the Fire Stick.If you are going to buy an internet accessing \"toy\" for your tv check out what apps are available before you buy.  Then buy the Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JJO"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It has only been a few days, but we are loving the Fire TV Stick.

This is not mentioned in any marketing ad and had I known, I would not have purchased it. Maybe that's why it isn't mentioned anywhere?

I also have a roku 3 and I actually prefer this.  I like the small remote, the unit is fast and responsive.  I also seem to be able to get a more reliable wifi signal on this versus the roku (router is on the main floor and this is on the second floor).  This does everything I need it to do.
