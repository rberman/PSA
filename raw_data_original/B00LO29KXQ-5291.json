This has been the worst purchase I have made with Amazon.  Remote won't stay working so then I go to just my regular tv remote to get the system to work.  I also purchased the voice activated, which also stops working, the voice part, gives like 2 seconds to say what you want, and most times does not understand so you can never get it to work and then it stops working all together.  My Amazon prime doesn't work, as I continue to get a library content error.  But I sure can BUY MORE movies from Amazon and those will work, but nothing that comes free works.  HULU does not work outside the United States, nor does the Showtime.  I have almost given up trying any other programming.  The only thing that does work is the Netflix, but hardly worth spending 100.00 for the access.I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/9", "author": "Tammie S."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Here is the Problem with these sticks, apparently they are very \"picky\" on what TVs they want to work with.  I bought two and the first one I installed had issues every night I used it for a week (wouldnt turn on, would not connect to wifi, had to unplug to restart, etc).After 5 days, I tried installing it on another Tv and it would not turn on, called Amazon and was told about how \"picky\" they are, they sent me a new one and had me install my second one to see if it was a TV issue or a Fire TV Stick, it was the stick that was the problem.I like the idea of this product, I like that my kids do not have to cast their ipad to the chromecast anymore, but this first impression/experience I had with this does not allow me to rate it more than three stars, I will upgrade it to 4 after more time if it does not have any more issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "shieldfan"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "MINE WORKS BUT THE LACK OF SUPPORT OR A TECH NUMBER OR PERSON FORCES ME TO GIVE IT A ONE STARI have plenty of questions and no answers ......It does play Amazon Movies no prob but everything elsehas let me down", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/6", "author": "Excel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the fire stick.

What the heck is network TV? I love this thing.Easy to set up, initially had some connectivity issues, would drop my WIFI connection from time to time.  Amazon must have run an update because it works flawlessly now.  I also have Chromecast, but the Fire TV Stick w/ Remote is working out better than expected.  You can also use your smartphone as a remote.  Overall very impressed.Bought a second for my sister in law for Christmas, delivered on time and she's already in business.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J Dizzle"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Adds no value over a modern smart TV.
