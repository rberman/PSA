[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "The connectivity is bad!  Every time I turn it on it says there is a network connectivity problem.  The problem is with the stick not my network.  I have multiple devices that work perfectly fine with my wi-fi connection.  The only way to fix this is to unplug the device and plug it back in.  Extremely inconvenient and frustrating.  Returning today and going back to my reliable Roku device.

The ROKU box or stick reigns KING in this arena of streaming devices.  Even Chromecast beats out the Amazon Fire TV Stick and/or Box. ROKU is more open and has tons more channels and content available.  And, you don't have to be a member of the Prime Society of Amazon.  Only good thing about my purchase of this Fire TV Stick was that I bought it at the introductory price of $19.99 and turned around and sold it back on Amazon for $49.99. I took the profit and bought myself another ROKU 3 box that has all the whistles, including a jack for headsets that transmits wireless through the remote!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "rsgallo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love it!

I can't watch ESPN unless I have cable or satellite provider. If I had a satellite provider I would'nt need the fire stick. Looks like I'll have to set my chromecast back up to watch YouTube.
