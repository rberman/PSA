This device does not support DLNA  OR NFC which means I can't stream directly from my android, the allcast app they recommend doesn't work. So instead I have to upload videos to there cloud service more like clips, I can't upload anything more than 20 minutes, the worst part even if the video I upload is in in 1080 it streams it in friccen HTML which is what your phone uses because it can't support flash.....so it's below flash quality. Not to mention I have to pay for the cloud service.If your obsessed with the highest quality video like me go elsewhere. The only time anything actually looks hd is when I play a movie from my iPad using airplay.Some good stuff, it's fast as hell I very rarely have loading times, the voice feature works great to, however it won't work with netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Derek"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Amazon Fire TV is the best.
