I already had Prime. Just take time to read about all you get with Fire TV Stick and Prime. Too much to list here. It works great with movies and tv shows and if you like you can download app for a tablet or phone to control the stick instead of using the remote that comes with it. Then you can use voice controls to find what you want.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Miguel"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "When it works it's great. Unfortunately very frequently I turn on my TV and I'm told the Fire Stick can't connect to the Internet. I have to unplug it and wait until it reboots. I just don't like having to climb behind furniture to unplug and then wait. I use the extension and the stick is less than 5 feet from the wireless router.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Colleen O.
