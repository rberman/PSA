[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "This system is not what is is raved to be. It constantly goes out and has a very weak signal with the wifi. We tried everything, moving the modem, removing items that may have blocking the signal but nothing worked. I contacted customer service and they were helpful. However they gave me many solutions when i really wanted a refund.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Peter S."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This product is exactly as advertised and more! Easy to install and operate. Choice of programs is excellent. We have Google TV, but Amazon Fire TV surpasses it in available free channels and subscriptions. It was easy to activate Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go and of course Amazon Prime. I compared it to other TV sticks available and this has the most features. I love the idea I can take it with me to hotels and watch my programs. I would recommend it! We have relatively slow internet connection as cable is not available where we live, but viewing movies and serials is smooth and uninterrupted. Kudos to Amazon for giving us Fire TV! I would recommend adding voice activated remote, but the remote that comes with the stick is easy to use as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Martha Lacko"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The fire stick is easy to use, plug and play.

I am waiting for the USB Power cable to arrive because my power outlet is far from the TV so I am using an extension cord.

The fact that can access Prime videos, Hulu, and Netflix all from my \"non-smart\" tv without having to plug my laptop into it is just awesome!  Definitely recommend 40 mbps internet at a minimum though. Have Time Warner 70 mbps and there is rarely even a hint of buffering except with YouTube...but always seems to suck no matter what device or whose internet i use.
