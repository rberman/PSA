[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "DO NOT BUY THIS! It's a huge waste of your time! I bought this as a gift for my husband's birthday. Of course it didn't work. I called Amazons support and all they had me do was unplug it and replug it back into the TV. Still didn't work. So they sent me a second one. The second one didn't work. Again called Amazon. They sent me a third one. Still did not work!! Then I had to spend an hour on the phone trying to get my money back. Now I have three fire sticks that I have to drive to UPS to mail them back. Such a waste of time!! The product isn't made very well and feels cheap. Think twice before buying this. Don't make the same mistake I did.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Megan Grant"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Update 5-28-15 Just found out my Sony Bravia factory TV remote controls this thing!!!! Found out by accident, but it works I was so happy now I don't need that little remote that always gets lost. I didn't program it or anything. Another thing that has been happening for about a month regardless of what remote I use is that Netflix launches and everything seems fine and you can click on everything, its just when you actually try playing a episode or movie it loads about 5% than says error. So, I have to go back to the fire tv main screen and load Netflix from the apps section instead of the recently viewed or whatever it is. VERY ANNOYING!!!!! Otherwise I still like it.4-1-2015Still cheaper than any wifi blu ray player I have found, which is basically the alternative. Chrome cast doesn't have a remote which is a deal breaker for me. It serves the intended purpose I bought it for, which is steaming Netflix in the bedroom. In that respect it seems to work well with no obvious flaws. What I do not like is that all the extra things on it are basically there to try and get you to purchase prime, and honestly I wasn't seeing anything on prime that grabbed my attention and that isn't already on Netflix. I did have hopes that prime would actually have newer releases or more content than Netflix, and in that case I would be interested but not with the current offerings. HBOGO seemed promising, but I will not purchase something that I already pay for in my regular cable in the living room. I wish they had a Comcast app that allowed all the channels and on demand you get with a cable box, but that's wishful thinking. If you're looking for a fairly cheap streaming device that doesn't take up really any space and works well I would recommend this. For those of you who say you eliminate the cable box by making this purchase, I would not agree at all. I am not the biggest fan of my cable provider, but after thinking about getting rid of cable and just streaming, I wouldn't do it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's alright.

It does work well for Amazon's content, but I also wanted a way to connect to my computers to stream media from them for that TV.  Plex seems to be the only choice so far but I really dislike Plex.  If Serviio ever gets working on it, I would like it much more, but not until then.

I am so glad to not be tied to the cable box anymore. I love that you add Netflix or Hulu for the ultimate in commercial free viewing. If you are thinking of walking away from the cable company....

I needed a vehicle for mobile HBO viewing (not my Kindle Fire), and, as a Prime member, decided to try a Fire stick. Amazon has been bragging about the HBOGo app so this should have been a no-brainer. Wrong. Silly I am to assume that since I can watch HBOGo on my Kindle, I could watch it on Fire TV. Much to my chagrin Comcast, one of the largest cable providers in the country, is woefully missing from the list of providers. I really don't understand how this omission can ever occur when there seems to be deals already in place. Oh well, shame on me for not completely researching before buying.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Glenn Chase"}]
