All in all though, it's another reason for me to continue to patronize Amazon for basically everything. The processor seems to be faster than my Roku 2 so that's a plus. Overall I recommend this device. It's a must have in this day and age. By the way, the Fire TV App is top notch. Better than Apple TV app and leaps and bounds over the Roku App.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert Laurie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "good as always", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert M Simmons"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy set up - decent movie selections - for the price best value.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin Kubota"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product and easy set up.
