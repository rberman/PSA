[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I gave this a 5 star even though it has an awkward GUI.  You should be able to see just the Prime TV/Movies, like Netflix.  But other than that, this blows away any other streaming box I have used.  I have a hacked AppleTV with XBMC, Roku Stick, and a Roku 1.  This did everything I wanted, no hacking involved(using Plex).  None of them come close to working as well as this.  It Is Fast!!!!  I can't wait to buy the actual Fire TV to get a box with a wired connection and more space.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Peter Jacobsen"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Extremely  zippy.

I replaced my chromecast and haven't looked back. The netflix app is the same app as my Xbox one (Same version) so it's easy for my wife and kid to relate. Amazon prime works like a charm and the ability to play android games is a bonus for my kid.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Caleel"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "We're most disappointed by the fact that you have to plug in the Fire Stick for it to work.  I guess we didn't notice this because it wasn't in the initial description or we assumed that the stick only needed plugged in for updates.  Instead, it needs to be plugged in ALL THE TIME.  We were just surprised to find that it needed to be plugged into an outlet where other streaming sticks, like the Chromecast don't.  It certainly takes away from the ease of use.  Now, I'm not able to move the stick easily from one TV to the next if I want to hide the wire the same way I hide my other TV cords.  It's just an eyesore.  If it weren't for this, we'd give it 5 stars!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jenn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Can mirror my Samsung s5 screen.

Initial set up was easy, although the software update took quite a while. I found that my TV's USB port will supply enough juice to power the stick which was nice since the wall wart provided is a little weirdly shaped and didn't really play nice with the surge protector I was using.  The remote is small but well put together and intuitive. There are a couple of help videos to help you get started but honestly they were not necessary. The video viewing apps (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Showtime Anytime, YouTube) that I tried worked very well. If you are a Prime member then the this is the streaming stick for you.  The only drawback of the device is a few missing video apps. First, and most importantly. is HBO Go. While there is a lot of HBO content available thru Prime the lack of current programming and Game of Thrones is disappointing. I believe the lack of HBO Go support will be rectified in the new year. The other app that I would like to see is FX Now, especially since every episode of The Simpsons is now available through that service.  The unit doesn't really power off, there is a screen saver that pops up after a bit (configurable) and then the unit goes to sleep. They device wakes up quickly with push on any of the remote buttons. I can't speak to the game play on the device as that's not why I purchased the unit and haven't tried those apps.  I also haven't tried any casting with the stick but I will soon.  All in all I have not run into any problems and would definitely recommend this to a friend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Ray"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "greatest thing to have thinking of getting more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
