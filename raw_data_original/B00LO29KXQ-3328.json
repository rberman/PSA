[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I like this product, it makes watching television easier for me. My only real issue is with Hulu Plus, it constantly stops or plays the sound but not the visuals. I have a very strong internet connection but for some reason the app doesn't play well with the Fire TV Stick. I watch most of my television through Hulu Plus and have to unplug the device and connect my laptop top my television. It sucks! So, if you use Hulu then I do not recommend this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mark"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "As Described, Well Packaged, Promptly Shipped.
