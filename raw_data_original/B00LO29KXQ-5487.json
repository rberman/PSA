[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "My husband and I really are enjoying our New Amazon Fire Stick. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good way to stream. They offer so many varieties of movies on Amazon Prime, we find it hard to choose. So go ahead get try it out! It is so  easy to set up. If you like Lifetime movies Amazon Prime is for you. :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alice Saavedra"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Nice product, work great, easy to install. I did discover that if its connected to a HDMI close to the antenna input in will cause reception interferenceon free tv stations. Just move to an HDMI as far away as possible or use provided extension.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "P. R.

I had received it a few weeks back but in the back of my mind i was thinking this wouldn't work and didn't have the motivation to tinker with it to get it working. I quickly found how mistaken I was!pros:1. wireless - works incredibly well; the old boxee box wireless was worthless and I was a bit apprehensive about the firestick, but i was able to stream some very high bit rate content. i have a firetv and the only difference is that when rewiding/fast forwarding the firestick takes a second or 2 to buffer while the firetv is virtually instanteneous.2. open - with adb turned on; any app can be side loaded. I was able to get kodi/xbmc gotham 13.2 up and running in no time3. kodi gotham 13.2 runs unbelievable well - high bitrate movies work great; i have only a few frames dropped on some very large bitrate items. in fact it worked better on some movies than 13.1 on my firetv; so I immediately upgraded firetv to 13.2.4. compact and easily hidden; radio remote is awesome. don't really use the voice with xbmc. i was able to configure the keymaps they way we like the remote and it works perfectly.5. i got it when it was $19 - and this has to a better deal that the rpi which I have played with as well; still think this is a better bang for the buck at $39 given the other apps (netflix, prime instant video, etc) that it boasts.cons:1. usb power cable is too short; i have the bedroom tv mounted above standing eye-level; so landed up have to include an extension which is not very aesthetic for now.summaryoverall, I'm very impressed by this tiny flash drive looking this. I own the chromecast, boxee box, firetv; owned for a short while all three versions of the apple tv; built my own openelec media center; and this HAS to be the best bang for the buck even at $39; and at $19 it was a steal!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BCHOOR"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic product.

Had some initial issues with my Kindle not mirroring (with anything, including the TV stick, not a TV stick issue!).  A few phone calls and Amazon forum threads and Amazon figured out the problems and in heroic fashion came through with an update to the Kindle.The responsiveness and fluidity of the action on the screen is amazing.  Very fast.  Netflix works great.Much more user friendly than other casters.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Radio Davio"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really like this device! I was able to preorder it for half off, as a Prime member. Setup was pretty easy and so far I haven't experienced much lag in movie or tv playback but Prime music on the other hand is a bit of a problem, I have experienced some songs stopping and taking a few seconds to play. I haven't had time to use it on a daily basis to see if any issues were cleared up but overall I have enjoyed using the fire stick and enjoy using it as a replacement for cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"detroitmel\""}]
