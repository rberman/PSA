[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is amazing. My roommate has the Fire TV which is simply amazing. I still think the Fire TV has more content and but the Apple TV's airplay feature is an awesome killer option. I'm more Apple friendly. I love all products and brands, but I wanted to keep it in the same eco system. I finally caved and bought one as it was recently gone down in pricing. It has awesome apps, some of which I like more like FXNOW, FOX, and ABC which I thought I wouldn't use but ended up using the most. It helped me get caught up on quite a few shows. Fox didn't need activation, it literally let me play the show as soon as I entered the app and selected the show I wanted to watch.It's small/beautiful and awesome. Probably the most apps. I didn't like the fact that it didn't have amazon prime, but the airplay mirroring fixed that issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Mr. Brown"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very neat device.  Definitely worth it to help me access Netflix, Hulu and my NHL game cast channel.  Only thing that sucks is that most of the channels offered require a TV provider login/password which defeats the purpose of having broken free from cable!  Can't watch the ESPN, Showtime, or any other channels without that login/password.  I feel like why would you need Apple TV if you had cable?  It's confusing to me, I hope one day all basic cable will be free and I can watch nationally televised sports on NBC/ABC/CBS through the Apple TV.  Other than that, I like how easy it is to rent/buy movies from the Apple Store and how easy it is to access my shows on Netflix/Hulu.  Remote is easy to use, AND easy to LOSE!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "G. King"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Unfortunately one of the worst apple products.

(Any help, Amazon?) If you're looking to kill your satellite or cable subscription because of the unethical billing practices they have and you're tired of paying $1000+ a year for \"300 channels of nothing\" -- not picking and choosing what you want to pay for, etc -- then this is your ticket out if you live in the Mac universe.The hardware is (to be blunt) outdated and slow compared to Amazon's new TV box. And the types of media \"channels\" that you can access are pretty much the same in both environments, and the streaming purchases options pretty much the same. What's different is whether you prefer to make your purchases through iTunes or not. If you do, this is your best solution. If you don't, there's no real reason to buy the Apple TV. I happen to be an iTunes music buyer and movie buyer so it makes sense for me to continue that with Apple TV. If not I would've gone with Amazon's box because of the more powerful hardware it has.Biggest Plus: seamless integration with iTunes and Netflix. Menu system is decent but cluttered with a lot of \"sample channel\" filler. A bunch of the  providers listed, only show bits and pieces of their shows, which makes it harder to navigate. Luckily the most important one (Netflix) is right at the top of the list. :)Biggest Minus: super-flimsy remote, had setup problems right out of the box because it hadn't been updated. Maybe have been sitting in the Amazon warehouse a while. After 3 attempts I got the software updated and the sleep problems I was having (took 15 minutes to wake) went away.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "CMOS"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Although this was the second unit shipped to me (hence the 4 stars) it does what I was expecting.
