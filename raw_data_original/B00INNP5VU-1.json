I already have a Sony BluRay player but it doesn\u2019t have all the things I want to watch\u2026 specifically Korean shows. I was watching them through a laptop connected to my TV but the quality wasn\u2019t great and they buffered & pixilated even though the computer was hard wired to my router. We gave up entirely on Viki because it streamed so poorly and moved on to Drama-Fever which was somewhat of an improvement but not great. Since Drama-Fever streams only Roku we gave it a shot because it was on sale for just under 40-bucks and all I can say is WOW! What a difference in picture quality and having a remote that has some features is a real plus. It was an easy install once I found my router\u2019s password. My only complaint is that I had to provide a credit card or PayPal before I could finish setting up the required Roku account. Watching Drama-Fever is now light years better than with the laptop\u2026 picture fills the screen and sub-titles are even larger\u2026 plus there\u2019s a 7-second rewind now in case we don\u2019t catch everything that was said. Haven\u2019t done much with it so far but so far it\u2019s great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Todd M. \"On The High Desert\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works great, easy hookup!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Maddox"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Bought one before.
