[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I'm so happy I got this.  Only had a little glitch when installing Netflix.  It seems there's an update that you must download for the Fire TV in order for it to work.  Once I figured that out everything went smoothly.  I don't have a lot of the other apps because I'm happy with Prime and Netflix.  Works great.  I don't have a smart TV so this is perfect for our needs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "gretaloo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best device ever - so many channels to choose from.
