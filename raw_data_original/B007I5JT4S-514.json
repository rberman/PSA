[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy setup.  Only had it a couple of months and already has new programming available.  If you have an iphone, looking at your pics and videos on the TV is super easy.  Works great with netflix and hulu+.  I don't miss cable at all.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CHRISTINE"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love Apple TV.  Watching rented iTunes videos, while more expensive than Redbox, the streaming quality is great.  Also, the Apple TV streams Netflix so much better than my Sony Blu-Ray....the Sony gets alot of pixelation and the Apple TV doesn't.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kenneth A."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Pros: Great little product. Extremely easy to use. HBOGO application was added with the last update (must have an HBO subscription to use). Watch ESPN app is great. Mirroring from an iPad or iPhone is still incredibly cool. Downloading the remote app for your iPhone or iPad is a MUST.Cons: It really hates to be hard wired to the internet. I have no idea why, but have given up on that. It runs great on WiFi.Updates sometimes take a couple of attempts. You can obviously skip updating, but you will miss out on awesome new features and improvements (like HBOGO).The app selection is still a little thin.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Korey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We also have a samsung blue ray that we use to view Netflix. That thing is so slow. The apple tv is farther from the router but it works flawlessly. I haven't tried to download pandora on it. I'm nit sure that's available.

Wow!  Really impressed.  I did have to reboot my iPad in order for the airplay icon to appear but no problems afterwards.  Sure there's a lot of fee based content here but since I cut cable years ago I wanted to be able to stream stuff off all my apple devices and home computer onto the TV.  Easy peasy.Now if we can only get Amazon Instant Videos app to become airplay compliant.........", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Marc"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If u use iphone or any mac gadget this product is a Must to have, helps a lot in sharing/presenting photos and movies on streaming from the iphone to th tv", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "M\u00e1rcio Lopes de Assis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Apple TV is much easier to use than the smart wifi built into our LG TV.
