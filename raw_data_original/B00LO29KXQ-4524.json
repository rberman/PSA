The size of a usb stick, but contains apps and images and a good solid program!  My only complain is some of the menu layout and function, but it's still completely usable and fairly user friendly.  I bought this as a pre-order, so it was super cheap.  Cannot beat the quality for the price.

Specifically I'd like to see more apps that can stream content from more networks, such as Comedy Central, MTV, Discovery, TBS, etc.  I know these apps are available for other devices and allow you to stream full episodes and clips for free (or with a valid cable subscription), so I'd like to see them available for the Amazon Fire TV stick as well.  I do know that hulu plus is available, but even if I were to purchase a subscription, I still would not be able to stream all the shows I'd like to since not all of the shows I watch are on hulu.  At the time of this writing, I know it's still a fairly new device/service, so I'm sure some of these apps will eventually become available.
