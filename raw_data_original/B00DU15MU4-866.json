If you are looking for a movie, you have to search in every individual app.  If you do a general search in the \"home\" area, it only looks at Amazon content.  I found a movie the other day for rent on Amazon for $3.99 and then went to netflix (which I also subscribe to) and found the same exact thing for free!!!  Also, it won't let you just search for the free stuff that you've already paid for on Amazon Prime.  Thinking of switching to Roku 3.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.
