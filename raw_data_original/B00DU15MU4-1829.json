Prime member,  Kindle,  etc.  I couldn't decide btwn Fire TV or a Roku,  so I bought both,  intending to give the other to my so.  I was willing to wait for HBO,  but it turns out if you are a Directv customer,  you CANNOT watcb Showtime on Fire TV.  Whaaa what?  Deal breaker.  While voice search was cool,  the Roku feature of searching for a movie/show and being given a  list of results showing ALL options (Netfix,  Amazon,  Hulu,  etc) AND prices for each (good to see what options cost and whichare free for the SAME movie)  is killer!  Not to mention Roku presents Amazon  Prime movies in a much better format.  Love Amazon but Im sending this back.
