The channels are abundant with a new PBS app and Smithsonian Channel app as well as the regular Netflix and Hulu apps and more.TIP:  If you click and hold on an app, it will select it, and not open it, and allow you to then relocate it with the arrow buttons.  This can help to stick apps you don't use at the bottom and bring ones you love up to the top for easy accessibility.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "D. L.

The apps were slow and clunky and the video quality was worse.  The home screen is full of stuff I don't want on my home screen (that's very very minor, though).  The Apple TV only works on wifi, so despite being 1 foot from my router and having an Ethernet port it still had to be wireless.  Not sure why they won't just let it work on the Ethernet port.  But airplay only worked (the little it worked) on wifi.Netflix is something we use daily.  We both hated the app on Apple TV.  Slow and clunky.Same for crunchy roll.I didn't notice an Amazon instant video app, so that means we still need the PC.I'd have still kept it if airplay worked well.  But it didn't.  In fact airplay got netflix to work ONCE.  After that it didn't work again.  I wasted my one use on Red Dwarf.  (The holoship episode).Sadly that was also the case for airplaying my display from the Air.  It worked one time after trying half a dozen times.  That one time it was not impressive, the display was in a window on screen.  At no time did the display scale and fill the screen so it was too small to really see.  I tried it a dozen times after that and it didn't work again.  The Air would try and try.  A couple times the Apple TV went black but didn't display the Air screen.What was cool is that my TiVo came up when I tried to airplay one time.  I will have to check that out.  The letters wore off my TiVo remote so I couldn't get my password punched in, but I'm intrigued.  If I can airplay to my TiVo I really don't need Apple TV.I wanted to love it as much as I f'n love this ipad Air, but I couldn't.  It just isn't ready to replace a PC plugged the tv.  I want to give it two stars, but I realize that not everyone has a PC or the layout for that to work.  If I didn't have a PC I'd have probably loved it, even without the airplay. I'd have said 4 stars in that case.  Hey diddle diddle, a three.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "david laufnick"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Cannot return with Amazon.

For most people, the 3rd generation is the way to go. It offers improved performance in several key areas over the 2nd generation Apple TV. But if you want to jailbreak the AppleTV, you can't with the 3rd Gen so you'd want to find the 2nd Generation.From an appearance standpoint the two generations look identical. It's what is inside that makes the big difference.Here are the notable improvements in the 3rd Gen Apple TV. \u27ba it supports 1080p/720p, whereas the 2nd Gen only supports 720p \u27ba it has a faster on-board chip, the A5 vs the A4 chip in the 2nd Gen. \u27ba it supports 5GHz networking whereas the 2nd Gen only supports 2.4GHzThe faster A5 chip really makes a noticeable difference in navigating the interface. And of course since the Apple TV now supports 1080p and has 5GHz networking, the A5 chip helps enable that higher spec performance.The back of the Apple TV has, from left to right: \u27ba AC plug \u27ba HDMI port \u27ba MicroUSB port \u27ba Optical Digital output which supports Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound \u27ba 10/100 Base-T EthernetIncluded in the box is an AC power cord and an Apple Remote (IR.) Concerning the remote, since it is infrared, the AppleTV has to be able to \"see\" the remote or you have to bounce it off walls or ceiling to control the AppleTV. The best alternative is to use the app and control the AppleTV from your iPhone.The available content on the Apple TV has been greatly expanded with this newer generation. Here are the highlights of great content available: \u27ba Netflix - \u27ba Hulu Plus - paid content \u27ba HBO Go - access to HBO programs if you subscribe to HBO already \u27ba PBS \u27ba ESPN \u27ba ABC - doesn't yet work with Time Warner Cable \u27ba NBA - premium but some free content \u27ba NHL - premium but some free content \u27ba Crackle - movies and tv shows similar to Netflix \u27ba Bloomberg \u27ba skyNEWS \u27ba Trailers \u27ba Weather \u27ba KORTV - Korean station that offers video on demand - free and premium content \u27ba Disney Channel - doesn't yet work with Time Warner Cable \u27ba Disney XD - doesn't yet work with Time Warner Cable \u27ba Disney Junior - doesn't yet work with Time Warner Cable \u27ba Smithsonian \u27ba Yahoo Screen \u27ba iCloud Photos \u27ba iMovie Theater - iMovie projects that you share to the theater \u27ba Podcasts - \u27ba YouTube - video sharing \u27ba Flickr - photo sharing \u27ba Vevo - music videos \u27ba Vimeo - video sharing \u27ba MLB.TV - Major League Baseball - some free content but a premium subscription is $24.99/yr \u27ba Qello -  HD concert films and music documentaries - $4.99/mo \u27ba Crunchyroll - anime on demand \u27ba MLS - Major League Soccer \u27ba Radio \u27ba WSJ Live - programming from Wall Street JournalThat's quite a line-up and I'm certain Apple will be adding more content as time goes by. Keep in mind that some of the content is paid content but much is free and most content will require you to set up an account whether the content is free or paid.In addition to all that streaming content the Apple TV also provides some additional benefits to people in the Apple ecosystem. It has AirPlay and consequently it is now possible to stream to your HDTV your MacBook Desktop, iPad or iPhone. It can essentially mirror whatever is on  your device and stream that to your HDTV. This is fantastic for presentations, sharing slideshows, tutoring people and so much more.But even more interesting is the fact that you can now extend your desktop of your Mac computer to your HDTV. It's as if you now have two monitors hooked up to your computer. Once you start enjoying that feature I'll bet you'll be hooked.I love my Apple TV. The faster processor just makes the thing faster and it's been rock solid in performance too. Setup is a breeze.
