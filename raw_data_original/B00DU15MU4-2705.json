You may watch a first episode or series for free only to find that subsequent ones require payment. We are still getting used to it. Have not found our favorite creative shows.

Cannot get sports radio stations I want, cannot get sport stations I want, very confusing on how to get the ones they offer, Netflix does not work, keeps saying \"unable to process your account at this time\", and it is cheaper to rent a movie from Redbox than through Amazon, and Redbox has more up to date releases.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/6", "author": "Maria"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "We view Prime Videos and Netflix, Roku still has the lock on performance with these two content suppliers. The voice search on Fire TV is fantastic and we use it exclusively for Prime. Video performance is also superb on Fire TV for Prime videos. But Netflix has to reload frequently during playback. We have a commercial high-speed wired Internet connection with virtually unlimited bandwidth and so my portal isn't an issue.We own 5 video streaming devices:  Google TV, ChromeCast, Roku, Roku Stick, and Amazon Fire TV. Only the two Roku devices can play videos without buffering delays for both Prime and Netflix (ChromeCast doesn't play nice with Prime because of the never ending childish war between Google and Amazon).Google TV buffers Prime frequently, but streams Netflix perfectly.Fire TV buffers Netflix frequently, but streams Prime perfectly.Roku and Roku Stick stream Prime and Netflix perfectly without any buffering. If Roku had a convenient search feature for Prime and Netflix like Fire TV's Voice Search then it would be the undisputed leader.For ease of use on our main TV, we use Google TV for Netflix and Fire TV for Prime. On our secondary TV in the bedroom we use Roku.Fire TV is an excellent device and if Netflix buffering problems were resolved it would be our streaming device of choice. If they were able to link the voice search to both Prime and Netflix, Amazon would have the market leader, hands down.We have been an early adopter of streaming devices (except Apple TV--we don't use iPhones) and haven't yet found the perfect device for our two video streaming content choices.
