Other than that it is fabulous! Set up is easy, use is easy, and software is very user friendly. Can't find anything negative to say about it except the power cord length. My power source is not that conveniently close to the television. Otherwise a great idea for Prime users who don't need or want another box to add to their media center, and/or anyone who don't have the other options such as Netflix and Hulu, etc. on their TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product easy to install amd comes with an Android app love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Francisco Hernandez"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The problem that I am living out of USA and I cant use all features.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mustafa Awwad"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was a great purchase.

Finally I am free to install it even though I have already bought this a month ago.Pro:1. Remote control is using bluetooth so you do not have to be on straight line with your device2. Installation is easy3. A lot of application are already inside Amazon App Store e.g. youtube, netflix, PBS Kids, etc.4. You can use your phone as your remoteCons:1. I wish the remote allows infrared as well. My \"old\" logitech harmony will not work with bluetooth.2. Some of my favourite apps are not compatible \"yet\" with Fire TV e.g. crunchyroll but no big deal since I can still use Roku for that.3. Your own Library for Amazon TV Shows (deduct one star due to this)If you own episode 1 and 3 for a particular season, you would need to scroll through the whole season and look for \"Watch it\". I wish Amazon can just show the one that you own to safe time.4. Youtube \"stream\" from phone is a hit/miss. I see some people manage to make it work but I personally not able to make it work but since I have chromecast so not really a deal breaker for me.Note: For those that has message HDCP Content Unauthorised. Content is disabled. (No Video only sounds), Remove the extension for the Fire TV stick. In my case it works fine after I remove the extension. (Weird, in the manual, it is \"recommended\" to use the extension to get a better WIFI signal).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TWCA \"TW\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great, but so learning how to use it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mala Thao"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was quick to install, every app worked flawlessly makes your regular tv into a smart tv for a fraction of the cost.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.

As of now its been running non stop for 5 hours.  Amazon Prime, Amazon and Hulu are all streaming in an outstanding manner.
