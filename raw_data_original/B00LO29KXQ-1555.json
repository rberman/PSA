The Roku used to pick up the signal with no problem. I decided to gamble and buy the Fire Stick in an attempt to get the Amazon Prime channel back. It worked! I have been able to access both Amazon Prime and Netflix without a problem on my basement TV. One caveat you may be unaware of: the Fire Stick must be plugged in to an electrical outlet! Fortunately, I had installed an electrical outlet directly behind the TV so I was able to plug it in without any wires being visible. I have had this Fire Stick unit for about a month and can stream with no problems. I'm glad because I have about 12 movies I bought that are in my Amazon Prime library that were rendered inaccessible when the Roku could no longer pick up the Amazon Prime channel.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John G."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best thing ever", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sixta Colon"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Got the stick so my terminally ill husband could watch some programs via SlingTV. Got a second stick too, hence the review. The Fire TV Stick has been such a disappointment. Shows freeze, audio continues then the visual catches up by surging forward (like fast forward). I thought it might be SlingTV but no, happens with Netflix too. Went through the troubleshooting steps with SlingTV tech support, which involves Force Stop, Clear Cache, Uninstalling ALL the apps--inconvenient if you have Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and YouTube--Reinstalling all the apps, and check if it works better. Worked ok and then back to freeze, ff. So back to watching Netflix, Hulu and Prime using the tv and suffer through SlingTV using the Fire TV stick.Wish I could send the stick back but I have 2 more months of SlingTV to go--also not one I am keeping.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "erudite \"Loves books\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I have had the fire stick for about 7 months now. It plays video well and he many cool apps and games. I chose not to pay for prime as the number of movies and TV shows that came with it were lacking. I have stuck with Netflix and hulu instead. My big complaint with it is that it will loose connection with my wireless router many times a day. Each time I have to reboot the stick and then it works fine for a while. I have tried different channels and bands on my work to no avail.

Great specs, great price, sleek design - it is all of those things.However, the Fire TV Stick longer works (well) with Netflix, making it worthless as that's 50% of the reason I bought it.  At first I thought this was just me - some setting or something.... but then I had a look at the Amazon community support forums (search for \"Fire TV Stick netflix stuttering\" and see for yourself).It seems, based on both Amazon support forums and others (AVForum, Reddit, Plex Media forum) that after a firmware update the NetFlix app has pretty much been broken. Audio and video stutter frequently, and as time goes on it seems to get worse. Resetting the device sometimes clears it up for an hour or two then the problems return.  Stuttering issues persist despite multiple attempts to resolve conflicts (TV/Stick refresh rate synch, clearing cache, resetting device, changing Wi-Fi channels, switching HDMI ports)Amazon Instant Video service, Amazon Music, Vevo, Pandora, YouTube seem to work fine, so clearly it's not a hardware issue or a network issue... it's an app issue.Until Netflix and/or Amazon can resolve these playback issues, I would NOT recommend the Amazon Fire TV Stick for anyone who wants to use it for Netflix streaming.If Amazon gets the NetFlix app working, this thing would be 5 stars all the way.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Doug H. \"greysoul\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This may sound like I work for Amazon (I don't) The Fire Stick is great, especially with Amazon Prime membership!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David Shelton"}]
