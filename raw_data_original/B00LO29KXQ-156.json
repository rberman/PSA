I also have an older Roku, and frankly the Roku is easier to operate for two reasons. 1) you can read the font, whereas the Fire Stick has a very small light font and you can not change that. 2) The Firestick app is a little harder to backtrack on, ie: go back and tell me what I just watched. I previously tried the ChromeCast and I have to say that is my least favorite. In the Firestick, as in Roku you can pause and go back scenes using the remote, however in the awful google version you can not do this. Firestick is much less expensive than the Roku, so I'm very happy with this purchase. I only wish that Amazon would understand that some people wear glasses and dont want to wear them in bed while watching tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark Twain IV \"Mark Twain IV\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We have both an Amazon Fire TV, and this Amazon Fire TV stick.
