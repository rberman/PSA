[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I don\u2019t do a lot of reviews on the things that I purchase on Amazon.  I read them all of the time here, and base many of my purchases on how good the reviews rate something. That being said, I\u2019m balancing out some of the negative ratings on the Amazon Fire Stick because frankly, some of the reviews here are are written by idiots.I haven\u2019t had any issues with speed.  Yes, the stick requires Wi-Fi instead of being able to directly tie it into your internet like the regular Amazon Fire TV.  I don\u2019t have both items, so I can\u2019t compare the speeds between them.  This is primarily used for work travel to be used on hotel televisions, so that the laptop can be used for work related activities.  Even on hotel Wi-Fi is has worked well.  Perhaps some people who have complained about speed aren\u2019t taking in account their own home Wi-Fi and how many items are using their bandwidth.  Complainers like this are typically the same ones who forget that brick walls disrupt their Wi-Fi signal or think that because their car can parallel park itself that it will keep them on the road while they text in rush hour traffic.Fun fact two?  We have this connected to Hulu Plus, Netflix, and our Amazon Prime account.  These are all paid services.  If you think that you are going to get these or any other service free because an advertisement showed someone using it with the Fire TV or TV stick then do us all a favor.  Get a mirror, look at your reflection within it daily, and spend at least thirty minutes a week building up your self-esteem, because like is going to be hard for your otherwise.Finally, like anything else in life, research goes a long way.  Yes you need an internet connection.  No, it might not work with every provider.  Yes, it is similar to Roku, so having both is stupid.  No, it might not work outside of the US.  Yeah, it comes with a power adapter, so guess what?!  It works best with the power adapter!  Research, don\u2019t be stupid, and for the people of tired of reading your life fails.In conclusion, we have had no issues with our Amazon Fire Stick.  We researched, use it effectively, and are really happy with it.  We also got it for 19 bucks, which made it even better.  It is a great deal nonetheless.  I recommend it to everyone.  Even stupid people.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Michael D. Menendez"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The stick only works if the usb cable is plugged in. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having a Stick!!??  My outlet is a few feet from my HDMI port so I have a long extention cord running across the floor.  My OCD can't handle this.  However after it is PLUGGED in, it does have a better picture and quality than I recieved with my Roku box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "E. THOMPSON \"\"luv prettyshoes\"\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the Fire TV stick! I was able to get it at the introductory price of $19. Even so I would still recommend it highly at $39. Pretty much all my media content is on either Amazon or iTunes. I have an Apple TV and two Roku 3 boxes. This would be a great gift for someone who has Amazon Prime and doesn't have a streaming device. For my needs, the price and functionality make it a better bargain than Apple TV. I usually use the Apple TV to show pictures of the kids to grandma. But I've been using the Fire Stick now since you can view your photos in the Amazon cloud. Works great! There are games available too but they aren't anything that the hard core gamer would want. I downloaded a bowling game and had fun playing. Overall, it's a really good buy. Glad I bought it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Edward McGinnis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am trying to wean myself off of satellite TV with its $70+ monthly cost. I had my bedroom TV just using an antenna, which gives you a lot of local channels, but is somewhat restrictive. I have another system similar to Fire TV, but it had to be plugged into the router to work. This was wireless, so I had Prime and the other service, both will work on it. It took a little doing at first to get the software to update, as I had misplaced the instructions, but the Fire TV site gave me the info to fix it. Once up, there are no problems. It gives a large selection of movies and other shows that provide more hours than I think that I will ever be able to watch. It is nice to have a system that provides this much for so little. Prime costs about less than two months of what I am paying now, and I can watch when I want rather than recording it. Outside of one plug to a wall outlet, there is not a tangle of wires. Please be advised that your set must have an HDMI port to use this, so check that you have one, most newer sets do, but make sure.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Arthur R."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "processor is noticeably slower and laggy vs the full unit. adb sideload would be better if the apps showed in the main apps page. My final gripe is coming from loving the Roku interface. Having to use the funky menu's sucks. You have to scroll all over the place to find what you want. They try to focus you into the amazon products before all else, as they want more money from you since they are offering this device for basically cost in some instances. Roku is so popular because its easy. It may not look as polished as the apps do on the fire whatever's but they are dead simple. I don't want 100 paths to what I want. If i want amazon video you should go into a amazon app on the main screen. That would simplify life tremendously. Like on a Roku. Finally voice search works well but it should be fixed to the app you are in. Say Netflix, Hulu or Plex. Not trying to find me content to buy from amazon when I am in a app from a totally different party which I am already giving my money to. I don't mind finding content from amazon but only when I'm in your menus. MAJOR SELLING POINT WAS HOTEL WIFI LOGIN MENU. THIS IS NOT YET AVALIABLE, COMING IN FUTURE UPDATE. some hotels require you to accept terms and conditions to use the wifi, if so you can not currently use this there. Fyi disney wifi works with this device currently as they do not require authentication in room. Thank god because im sick of the MUST DO channel.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J4Real \"J\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Just average streaming device. I am a home theater / music enthusiast. I have a Western Digital Live TV. The Fire Stick sound quality pales in comparison to the WD TV Live. I like the idea of convenience so I put the device in the bedroom where I listen with plain old flat panel TV speakers. The plus side to the Fire is that it is very fast with little lag time. I just can't accept the poor HDMI sound quality in my home theater.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joseph W. Pirosch"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Totally happy.  Our kids do not have cable in their rooms because of the cost to run the cable throughout the house.  This product allows them to watch Netflix and all the other stuff the kids want to watch.

We had an Apple TV (past tense, because it was kicked to the curb once we got the fire stick), and the Apple TV just wasn't laid out good, the remote was an app on the phone and that app on the phone hardly EVER worked! We were constantly having to unplug the Apple TV and re-plug it in just to get our app remote to work. It was SO frustrating. But now, with the Amazon Fire Stick, no more hassle, no more stress, it just WORKS and the apps are awesome. I love the auto-play feature on Hulu and Netflix. The apps on the fire stick work like the websites, which is greatly appreciated. So far so good....loving it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Morgan"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have tried to find a list of approved providers anywhere on the fire stick page...and I cannot.  There is a single mention, buried in small print that it doesn't work with all providers.  But I had to focus and dig to find that.  Clearly Amazon doesn't want customers to know this so they'll buy it anyway.  I'm giving this one star because this is horrible treatment of the customer.  I guess the stick works fine.
