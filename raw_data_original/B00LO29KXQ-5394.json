[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received the Fire TV Stick as a Christmas gift from my husband. When he found out that Amazon wouldn't ship the Fire TV Sticks again until January, he ran out to a big box store and purchased one of three that they had left.  Straight out of the box, the device was so easy to install. I plugged the stick into the HDMI port and put the batteries in the remote. I changed the input on my TV to HDMI 3 (The port that I plugged the stick into) Automatically, the Fire TV Stick began loading. I entered my wifi password and the Fire TV Stick started downloading and updating. After about ten minutes, that process was finished and I was ready to watch any movie or TV that I desire.  I have had no skipping, pausing, or loading issues like I experience with my Blu Ray player. I previously have used the Blu Ray player to stream Netflix. It was impossible to stream Hulu Plus on my Blu Ray player. It would skip, pause freeze, and reload. I actually unsubscribed to them after a few day trial using the Blu Ray player. I am now back with Hulu Plus.  So far, I have streamed Netflix, Hulu Plus, Crackle, Amazon Prime, and Showtime Anytime. I am in the process of adding all of the apps that I want to my Fire TV Stick.  I highly recommend the Fire TV Stick and I foresee the purchase of at least one more for my house.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "msrusl"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "So many things could be better with a good software update. Amazon, if you're listening, please implement the following:1. Update OS to support 5.1 audio from apps like Plex.2. Implement an alternate screensaver that turns off the TV via HDMI-CEC.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "liebezeit"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Totally no connection with home network?

It's small fast and efficient. Great for the casual user but get a Fire TV if you plan on watching a lot of Netflix, Prime, and HULU.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Smart Buyer \"honest shopper\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The device completely justifies the money(19$) that I spent on buying it. Everything works as expected; excellent picture quality, plentiful selection of apps and games.  The definite selling point of this device is the remote that ships with the stick. It makes navigation really easy in addition to supporting game-play out of the box. The only disappointing thing is that there is no way to shut down this device if we use an external power source to power it. The stick is advertised to conserve energy by going into sleep mode after 30 mins of inactivity, but I would have liked the ability to turn off the power to my gadget with the least amount of hassle.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anand \"anand\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing little gadget!

After navigating back and retrying it several times, it finally enabled parental controls.I have a very reliable AC router, and both 5GHz and 2.4GHz signals are quite strong (measured by two different Android test utilities). In fact the Samsung smart TV uses 5GHz band without ever dropping connections, while the Sony Player is on 2.4GHz frequency, and also works fine.I chose 5GHz band for the Fire Stick. It kept freezing, buffering, and eventually completely freezing, so I had to power-cycle it. I tried to use 2.4GHz, and it seemed to work stable, but occasionally was exiting the YouTube app.The interface is very slick and intuitive. The remote responds quite fast (much more responsive than Samsung H6350's remote)The build quality is very good. The remote control is perfect.I will keep it for another week or two to see if Amazon releases a reliable patch, otherwise there is no point keeping it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Arsen"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Worked when I first connected it, but has not worked since.
