It has met all my expectations. I no longer have to watch commercials. I don't miss cable TV whatsoever. On the Amazon Fire TV my picture quality is fantastic. There are a lot of things to watch for no additional cost when a subscriber to Amazon Prime. I had an error message and couldn't get certain shows. I called Amazon Customer Service Support and was connected to a real person within seconds. I had problems with cable TV and got the run around and it took a long time to speak with a representative which could not even help. I fought with them for 2 months until I stopped service and got Amazon Fire TV. When I called the representative from Amazon Customer Support, the problem was resolved in less than 5 minutes.
