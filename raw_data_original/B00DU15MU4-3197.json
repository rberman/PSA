The most forward-thinking feature is that you search for content first, regardless of provider, THEN choose the provider based on the lowest cost offering. Simply put, you\u2019ll never have to search Netflix and Amazon separately again.Portability _ It\u2019s so small I can throw the box, charger, and remote in my backpack and take it with me on business trips and use it at the hotel. I\u2019ve just ordered a second one so I can have it as my portable viewing solution while leaving the other at home for the wife. I haven\u2019t seen a box this tiny since Senior Prom.

Pre-downloads the start of content that it expects you to watch at some point so the movie starts instantly when do choose it? Seriously?Content - I\u2019ve had  a Kindle HDX for 4 months and I am really impressed with the evolution of Amazon Instant Video Content, and a lot of quality is free with Prime membership. A lot of popular movies that were in the theaters only 2 months ago are already available for purchase on Amazon, and cheaper than cable or FIOS prices.Jam this Box!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "42/58", "author": "cantslowdown"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "First the chart should be corrected.

This should solve the no surround sound issues...**UPDATE 2: (5/21/14)** Ok, I've been using the box for a while now, I really like it but I have to admit App development is a ton slower than I'd hoped, the library is growing but not by much yet.  A few new games come over and a few streaming apps, but no DLNA apps to speak of yet.  This is one of the things I consider to be the weakest point of the Fire TV so far almost 2 months in and no other local media options than plex yet......I am not a vine member (Those folks do excellent reviews, I'm just not that lucky to be Vine yet), nor am I speaking to something I don't own, By that I mean that I paid for it myself and here is my Experience so Far:Is it the best thing ever? No...Is it the worst thing ever? Nope, Not by a long shot...In fact, it's up with the top streaming boxes when you take into account future app development...It's a very good device, comparable to a Roku in most ways, some better some worse (Once apps start getting ported we'll see what happens) but there is plenty of room to make a \"FireTV 2\" much better in the future...So here's my review:Overall the packaging came in perfect order, it was easy to open, and nothing was missing.Setup was simple, It took a few minutes thanks to a large initial update to download, but otherwise just as easy as setting up a kindle fire.Pros:Android Based (which means many apps coming and the potential to root and gain more featuresAbility to use Apps (Not just having to rely on what's preloaded like to many older TV boxes and Bluray players)Accurate voice search - This one surprised me, It actually worked, Way better than Xbox Voice Commands or Siri, and Better than S Voice...Bluetooth remote (for some this is a con, but I don't want another Wifi device jamming my crowded signal Read on to see why I think this)It's not flashy - Matte Colors and no crazy lightsQuick to load - Just 28 seconds from Plug in to ready to stream (My Roku 3 takes 78 Seconds to do the same)Feels heavy - for the size it really has good heft (Doesn't feel cheap)Only 1 white light on front, It is a bit bright but not a deal breakerDoes Dolby Digital sound Out (DTS, 5.1 Etc) Via Optical or HDMINetflix In HD (Some android based players couldn't do this)Cons:Need to purchase separate gaming remoteNo Headphone jack in remoteLow on apps to start withNo Native DLNA Support (Hopefully Apps will fix that soon)No AC wireless band it has 5Ghz N but not ACCase can pick up fingerprints, but they remove easilyImmediate update after first plug in is big, Almost 900MB so it may take a whileThe power brick is bigger than I was hoping for, if you have a crowded power strip it might be an issuePlex is the only local media app available so far.Voice Search for media only works on Amazon Prime Videos, It will give you options to watch on netflix or Hulu if you go in, but if you want your personal network media you have to go into your app (Plex is the only one currently available) and search manually (Voice search kicks you back out to Amazon Video if you try it.Full Disclosure here I run 2 full HTPC's and a Roku XD and Roku 3 in my house, so my expectations of how this will end up working are very high.To beat out my other devices it has to Play local media (From my HTPC Server), have better functioning Apps than my Roku and be easier to navigate than my HTPC setups are.  It also needs to stream flawlessly and with as little buffering as possible (Netflix, Amazon Video, hulu, Etc.)So does it do this?  So Close!  But not quite...It is faster to stream than my Roku and HTPC when coming from internet sources, and it's faster to play local media (Using the Plex App)  But, right now Apps are not yet ported over, for me one of the most important ones is Mediabrowser 3, which powers my main HTPC setups and feeds local media to my Rokus, but Plex works fine, just without parental controls which I want...As far as lack of apps I'm not concerned with this as being android based it is simple for a dev to port them over and given that this will sell excellent regardless of the reviews here there will be thousands of apps coming in the next few weeks/months...My neighborhood is crowded with Wifi signals which makes interference a huge issue for me, the Roku 3 uses \"Direct Wifi\" to connect it's remote, which means that there is another device that puts out a signal to interfere with your other ones, plus it uses the same channel as your router so you can't even move channels to avoid the extra interference.  It may not be much in most cases but in an uber crowded locale like mine it is a definite negative, the FireTV's Bluetooth doesn't seem to cause any wifi interference...Voice Search, I was pleasantly surprised on this, it does in fact work, that being said in the middle of an action scene in 7.1 surround you will be hard pressed to make it hear you, but when navigating the main screens using voice search go me to every move or TV show I tried (Except, Ironically, since they use it as an example, Downton Abbey, It couldn't find \"Downtown Alley\"  LOL!)Roku VS FireTV:Roku has the edge currently with more/better apps, but this may not be the case in the near future when newer/better apps come out, But for pure speed the FireTV blows the Roku away, I'm streaming a movie from Netflix or local media before the Roku (XD or 3) has finished booting... (When both are unplugged and plugged in at the same time)HTPC VS FireTV:HTPC has the Edge, but that's only because we are comparing a Core i7 PC with an Android based device, So honestly there is little competition, BUT The FireTV has Amazon instant Video as an App, On Windows 7 there is no Amazon \"App\" you can use plus a Hulu App which is no longer supported on PC, so the FireTV wins int hat aspect, but in overall functionality the FireTV isn't a PC and therefore could never really compete, but who wants to has a full PC hooked to every TV in the house?Final thoughts:If you have a Roku XD or 3, you will not get much immediate bump other than speed by upgrading to the FireTV.  If you have an older Roku or a WDTV or similar box you will see a noticeable benefit in upgrading to this device.APP Reviews:Plex - The only option for local network content as of this review, Costs 99 Cents, But works well, assuming you can put it on your PC or NAS...Youtube - Works well, easy to link to your personal accountHulu - Easy, Simple, Just like the Kindle appNetflix - Does HD and Surround sound also supports Profiles!Pandora - Works as it should, Easy to navigateAmazon Instant Video - Not exactly an app in the traditional sense, It provides content when you go under the various categories on the home screen...All Apps load Audio and/or Video very quickly...My Rating is 4 Stars:5 Stars for build Quality and OS design overall-.5 Stars for Lack of Apps at Launch-.25 Stars for lack of headset jack in remote-.25 stars for Lack of High Speed AC band WirelessSo 4 Stars Overall, Very good but room for improvement*My star rating may change with Usage over time, it may go up or down depending on how well the device performs*If you haven't yet Check out my Video unboxing and quick overview of the FireTV!Just My Thoughts,AK", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/152", "author": "Amadeus B.

It appears to be limited to Amazon content, at least for videos. I believe that they do include a third party service if you search for music.I am searching for House of Cards, Season 2, a Netflix original. I am a Netflix subscriber so I would expect the Netflix listing to be displayed but Fire TV only returns the show's Season 1 available for purchase at Amazon and does does not list Netflix at all. As a Netflix subscriber, I could watch both seasons 1 and 2 for free but, according to Fire TV's search, Season 2 doesn't exist and I'd have to pay $2.99 per episode if I wanted to watch Season 1.See how Roku's search (second half of video) correctly shows that Season 1 is available from Netflix, Amazon, MGo and Vudu and that I can gety get Season 2 from Netflix. It's also telling me (checkmarks) that I subscribe to 3 of the 4 services listed.It's up to everyone to weigh Amazon's faster and more convenient voice search feature that returns Amazon-only content vs. Roku's ability to find content across the channels/services it carries._________________________________________________________________REVIEW BEGINS HERE:As a current/former owner and user of streamers such as Roku 3, Roku Stick and Google's Chromecast and also streaming/gaming platforms such as PS3/PS4 and Xbox 360/One, I believe I can do a fair assessment on what Amazon's Fire streamer is about and how it compares with the alternatives. I rely on reviews to help me make informed and rational purchase decisions and, hopefully, my assessment of Amazon's Fire TV may help others decide whether this is what they need or want.BROAD ASSESSMENTThe Fire TV will have to find its place in a pretty crowded marketplace. From what I've experienced so far, due to its tight integration with the Fire HDX tablets and Amazon's own Instant Video service in search it should be a great pick for anyone who owns the Amazon tablet and already subscribes to Amazon's Prime. Its ability to play games and the ease of downloading them should also appeal to non-hard-core gamers. For everybody else, depending on one's specific needs and expectations, the Fire TV may or may not be the 'right' streamer to buy.As one who purchased Amazon's original Kindle Fire on day one and went through several generations of Amazon's Kindle reader I expect that Amazon's streamer will also evolve or grow overtime. Amazon will listen to 'us' and the next generation streamer will be a much more interesting, 'new and improved', more capable and better tuned to our needs and wants. Until then, I would say that the current Fire TV is a competent, Amazon-content-biased (through search) streamer with gaming capabilities, lacking some in content and showing some innovation on search (offset by its currently favoring Amazon's service) and the user interface in general. Parental controls and the games could make it a favorite streamer if young children are also watching. If all you want is streaming and don't care about casual gaming you may feel that you are paying for capabilities that you don't need.CONTENTThe Fire TV offers most but not all mainstream services and I suspect it covers what most of us will ever want to access and I am sure that more services will be added in time. However, at this time Amazon's selection pales when compared to Roku's 1000+ wildly diverse channels but the Rokus have been around for a while. All mainstream services now on Fire TV are also available on Roku, PS3/4, Xbox 360/One and many on Google's Chromecast.Fire TV attempts to be a little different when it comes to accessing content, allowing for voice search but results are currently returned mostly from Amazon's Instant Video. By comparison, Rokus offer text based cross-service search with results returned from most 'big' providers. Amazon's attempt to predict and preload what we are most likely to watch will have to be assessed over a longer period of time so, time will tell.The soon to be implemented parental controls should differentiate and distinguish Amazon's product from the competition once they are implemented.INNOVATIONAmazon's great innovative, revolutionary, disruptive device was the Kindle reader and the enhanced Kindle Paperwhite. I suspect that thousands of acres of trees are still known as 'forests' instead of 'recyclable material' these days because of the Kindle. Amazon's Fire tablets are nice but they are... tablets. The Fire TV streamer/gaming device falls probably under 'okay' or 'interesting' streamers and 'not too bad' gaming platforms.The quad-core CPU is also nice but, whether I'm streaming on a significantly more powerful PS4 or a tiny one-core CPU Chromecast, the video/audio quality seems to be comparable and practically indistinguishable. I assume that the reason for a more powerful CPU is the game-playing part.The lack of large permanent storage (HDD) implies that, as a gaming platform, the Fire TV will allow for mostly small to medium-size games with a lot of cloud interaction and storage. Again, a feature that may not be suitable for those whose ISPs charge by the Megabyte or impose a monthly download quota on their customers.Game playing on the Fire TV works but those used with big console's lag-free controllers that 'rumble', talk back and sense motion may not view the Fire TV as a serious gaming platform.I would say that Amazon's streamer is solidly in the mainstream as far as innovation. It's a quality product but not a revolutionary one and that's still Okay.VALUEThere's very little that Amazon's Fire TV does that other platforms don't do.- The PS3/4 and the Xbox 360/One are vastly superior gaming platforms and equally good streamers and multimedia machines. Only they are much larger physically and cost significantly more.- The Chromecast and the Rokus are a lot more innovative and allow for a lot more flexibility and integrate nicely with tablets and PCs and allow for streaming personal content without being limited to a specific brand or model of tablet. They are also somewhat more difficult to setup.- Small streamers such as the Roku Stick and the Chromecast are very portable as they fit into one's shirt pocket. Amazon's Fire TV could be carried around at least in theory but it's not as easy to move around.- Roku is still the leader of 'content' but Amazon's selection should cover what most of us want to watch most of the time.- The Fire TV costs a lot more than a Roku or a Chromecast but, even if a gaming controller is added, is still less than a PS3 or an Xbox 360- Voice search as implemented on Fire TV at the time I am writing this (restricted to Amazon and Vevo) is in effect hiding content from other services, potentially costing you money if one show is available to purchase or rent at Amazon but it may be also carried by another service you subscribe to as a 'free' stream.WHO NEEDS IT?Anyone who already has one or more Roku, Chromecast or Xbox, Playstation in their homes probably don't need one at this time. Unless they are tightly integrated into Amazon's ecosystem or are cable cutters who wish some tighter controls over what their kids are watching.Those who are looking for their first streamer should consider- Fire TV's ease of use (beats the Chromecast but it's probably on par with Roku and the Xbox/Playstations)- Amazon's great user support- Roku's enormous channels selection- Playstation and Xbox being clearly superior gaming platforms (if you don't mind paying up to $60 for newly released games)- Amazon's attempt to keep their users confined to Amazon's own hardware platforms and content streams vs. Roku's and Chromecast relative openness- Fire TV's split gaming/streaming personality (Jack of 2 trades) vs. Roku's and Chromecast focus on streaming- Price, of courseIt's not an easy decision to make. I would be very happy with the Fire TV if it was the first streamer device in the house. With so many stream-capable and game-playing boxes/sticks already operating and doing well, I like Amazon's Fire TV for being a well designed, capable streamer with some nice extra capabilities but I also like and I've been using the Rokus for their huge number of channels and portability and great interface and the Chromecast for allowing me to easily send whatever is in my Chrome browser to the TV. I hope that Amazon's search will soon expand to cover non-Amazon services or it won't be a useful tool. I may not have the the Fire TV attached to the big TV in the living room but our daughter who happens to be a faithful Kindle and Amazon Prime user asked for it in her room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/895", "author": "Aragorn \"Cthulhu\""}]
