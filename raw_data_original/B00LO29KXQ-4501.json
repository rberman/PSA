It made my life better actaully! I can watch all kinds of movies and tv shows on my big-screen TV now while enjoying the free shipping as prime member. My daughter loves watching her Dora show and other kids show there. I also found some yoga and workout video there and try to follow it every day, which helps in this cold weather.Btw, very easy to set up, even a gadet idiot like me did it within 5 minutes.The only downside: sometimes the signal is not strong, it takes forever to stream, but i am very happy with what it has done for me, and try to ignore this little inconvenience.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tracie Jenison"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is actually really cool!
