[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "i LOVE THE ROKU IT IS SO AWESOME!!! To watch different shows that are part of the Roku like 80's flashback to see music and commercials from the 80's. I've been using this Roku for 1 year and I don't want to let it go.  It reminds me how awesome music videos started. Also the remote for the Roku is so easy, My family and I watch netflix many times. All I have to do is press the Netflix button and I'm in Netflix. Also there are many channels to choose from where I can watch cooking to sci-fi. So basically I love the roku it is for the whole family", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gregory william Norvick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best streaming stick on the market.

The first I gave to my brother because he we plugged it into his TV while visiting and it worked. Great trip entertainment for the evenings. Be aware MOTELs WIFI now days require you to browse to their page first and \"accept\" their terms.  This Roku  CANNOT do this.  Didn't matter if it worked on their TV's, you couldn't connect to the internet. It cannot browse.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "george"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A little hard to install, but once running I have used it for months now with no problem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven J Puchkoff"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really happy with this bought it for my Dad for Father's Day he loved it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C J"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Years ago, I fell in love with the Tivo. For a long time, it was one of the central pieces of entertainment gear I needed wherever I was living. Over time, as content has moved off the physical space and into the online sphere, that need has moved to the Roku. I've used several of the bigger cousins to the 3500R and have had almost nothing to complain about. The biggest selling point for me with the Roku is that it allows you to tailor it to what you want, and offers as much in the way of entertainment as any box 5 or 6 times it's size. Between Netflix and Amazon Prime for streaming off the net to the Plex app for my home media server, this thing does it all. I picked up the Roku Stick to use in an area with tight spacing. The performance has been close to on par with the bigger models, although I've run into a few random bugs that made a reboot necessary. It's also a bit slower than the boxes, but with the small size this is to be expected. Overall, it's still a great Roku product and still outclasses bigger and more expensive entertainment solutions.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ozone Joe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Highly recommend.  Got this for my extra bedroom and didn't want to get another cable box that Comcast can scam me with.  This is a great alternative tool with oodles of options.  Connected this to my Element HDTV.

One minute it works, the next it doesn't respond unless I take the batteries out and put them back in. I bought new batteries but I have the same problem. Again, my first Roku stick works fine but the remote does look a little different than the 2nd.  At some point I need to see about exchanging it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Raymond Smith"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Its not as slow as everyone makes it out to be. Its fast enough and works like it should. The only downside is this came with batteries that were low on juice. So we replaced them and all is well. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in owning a roku and streaming things online.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "chris lancaster"}]
