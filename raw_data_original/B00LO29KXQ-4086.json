[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Good TV stick. There's a couple of apps that give you free channels to watch. But to fully use it, you need to have access to amazon prime to watch all the content. Also since the stick is for HDMI only I couldn't connect my Samsung 40 inch HDTV 3d to the internet on TV mode to update the software on my TV. You can access internet on the firestick only and it runs an image to your TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeffrey"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JAMES J KOPYDLOWSKI"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesomeness!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jana Doss"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am very happy with the product.
