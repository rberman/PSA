Prime music playlists are very good. Standard remote is not the best game controller, but I don't play many games anyway. I would like to see a YouTube option since they have some good shows too. If NASCAR or Indycar races were available (even on a pay-per-race basis) I'd ditch cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard A. Weyda"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Fire TV Stick. I have a Vizio HDTV that is a smart TV and so I had gotten used to all the conveniences of having a smart TV. I got a second HDTV that isn't a smart TV so my Fire TV Stick allowed me to turn my second TV into a smart TV. Now I don't have to hook my laptop up to my TV to watch Netflix, I can use the Pandora app on my TV and watch Amazon Instant Video. All the benefits I have on my smart TV in my living room are now available on my HDTV in my bedroom thanks to the Fire TV Stick. I'd definitely recommend this to others. The price was great and I think it's much more cost effective to get a regular HDTV and add the Fire TV Stick than it is to buy a smart TV. I'd likely go this route for future additional TVs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jacqueline Morgan"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I purchased this on sale for $26...why was I charged $39...?

My only issues . . . \"only\" issue . . . is that now my digital channels (all of them) blink from time to some.  This did not happen before I started using this Fire TV Stick.
