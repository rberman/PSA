It is small and portable, and I am fed up with Roku. So, pluses all the way around. I have had 3 Roku 3's replaced in a year and a half, so they are officially on my list of \"do not buy\". This thing is SUPER easy to set up, my wife who is not very tech savvy set it up. Has a great little tutorial video to show the user how it works. I have listed some of the pros and cons that I have ran into on my endeavor of owning this item for the past month or so.Pros:- Very simplistic to set up, even for the people that are not tech savvy.- Robust apps with more on the way.- Does what both the Roku, and the chromecast do for a fraction of the cost.- Quality of the Picture on a 4k TV is amazing! (if it stays in HD)Cons:- Like most the Roku stick and the Chromecast, does not support HDMI 1.4a or MHL HDMI for power. Have to use the USB power cable.- As stated above the HD on the streaming does not always stay when playing even when using QoS, and have a 55Mbs/6Mbs connection. So, picture can get blurry in SD. Believe this is an Amazon to user issue. Because when using Media computer to stream, have no loss in connection.- Hulu Plus app will play and will get black screen with audio still playing after commercials every once in a while. Will have to pause and rewind, and wait to let the stick catch up with the host.As I stated, this Streaming device is great. It has worked out of the box and has its quirks, but is a great media device that doesn't take up much space. These minor glitches that I have encountered, am sure can be resolved with some simple coding and server fixes on amazon's end. Other than that, best 30 bucks ever spent. My Roku 3 died 61 days after use, the replacement died 8 months after that, then the 3rd, 6 months after that.... So, I am looking for alternatives and this has sold me. Plus, that machine froze up ever other day.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "fatguyinalilcoat \"cartman_98\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It would be nice if this could mirror my laptop or phone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pen Name"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to set up, easy to navigate, great picture quality!
