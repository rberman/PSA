If you know the name of a movie or show that you want to watch, voice recognition is terrific. However, if you want to search to find something for Prime members only,good luck. I could not figure out a way to browse Amazon Prime content only by genre.

I have an apple tv for my bedroom, but as soon as this came out I needed to get it for the family room. I love the voice search plus it has Showtime Anytime! That was one of the main factors of buying it. Apple tv does not have the Showtime app, this does so its perfect because my family loves watching the shows through them. Sure you can't search through only the amazon prime content, but it doesn't really matter to me because I have a netflix account as well. Overall, the product was fast and simple to set up.

The problem that I have with it is that Amazon Prime members still are prompted to pay to rent movies that are 20 years old.  Amazon needs to spend a lot of time upgrading their streaming library and make a Prime membership worth the price increase ($99 now).  One should be able to watch a \"free\" HD movie without paying a supplemental charge and at least watch movies that are more than a decade old without having to pay rental fees!!  For the free content, one has to click through the menu more than should be required to find the free material.  It is as if Amazon is trying to gouge the user for rental fees with its default settings for the searches.Update: after further evaluation, I have downgraded this device from three stars to two due to the pitiful content available to view by a Prime member without paying rental fees.  I must have searched 8-10 standard older movies and all required rental.  Just as bad as national competitor streamer account where nothing one wants to watch is available, as least in my experience.  This device may be a good portal for viewing streaming content. Good luck finding anything much worth watching without paying rental fees.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/9", "author": "J.

I ordered on Amazon with a 2-3 week 'initial' delivery lead time.  My spousal unit was home when it arrived, so he had already taken it over.  Here is what he had to say:Okay. I know that I\u2019m easily entertained, but this has to be on the top ten list of coolest gadgets ever. I\u2019ve recently been taking advantage of Amazon Prime\u2019s free programming in a quest to find something worth watching on TV. Mind you, my standards aren\u2019t particularly high but it\u2019s been a challenge because TV really does generally suck. With that said, I found the Amazon app for the Wii and have been using that as of late to broaden my entertainment options. However, I haven\u2019t been using it very often due to limited buffer, slow connection speeds and low resolution. This week, we finally upgraded to Amazon\u2019s new Fire TV device. Wow.The shipment arrived in only a couple of business days, which is more impressive than one would think given that when the order was placed, the estimated arrival date was two weeks away. Setup was more simple than you can even imagine:\u2022 Take out of box.\u2022 Connect device to TV or A/V system with HDMI cable.\u2022 Plug power adapter into outlet.\u2022 Turn on TV.\u2022 Follow instructions on screen.Yep, it was that difficult. Took me all of 3-1/2 minutes. From there, the Amazon Fire TVAmazon Fire TV literally does everything except enter the encryption code for your wireless network. Assuming that you\u2019re using a wireless connection instead of wired (as I am), it finds your network, leaving you to confirm the correct network and enter your code. After that, the device connects, installs any required updates and other than prompting you to select whether or not you want parental controls, that\u2019s about it. If you have an Amazon Prime account and you order it through Amazon, it comes pre-configured with your account information already in the settings.Once it\u2019s up and running (about 5 minutes to perform the software updates), it takes you directly to an introductory video that explains the basics. One that I might add, is almost unnecessary given the relative simplicity of the interface. Nonetheless, it\u2019s a handy short video that shows you the basics. There are more help videos available that you can access later on if you find something you\u2019re unsure about, but as previously noted, it\u2019s pretty simple to use and doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out how to navigate and find what you want.Picture and audio quality are excellent and run full 1080p. Even with the high quality, I have yet to experience any latency or buffering issues at all. Granted, my internet access runs on average around 40 mbps, so I can\u2019t attest to how it may operate at slower connection speeds, but with everybody on broadband these days I would be surprised if many had an issue.So far, the only issue that I\u2019ve had was finding programming that\u2019s free with Amazon Prime. From the home screen, it\u2019s listed in two different categories, \u201cRecent\u201d and \u201cTop\u201d Prime titles. That\u2019s easy, but if you search for something, when you pull the program up it shows the prices to rent or buy. On the Wii app, the program image has a little band across the corner that tells you the title is included free with Prime. The Fire TV didn\u2019t appear to have this, so at first I was having difficulty finding the free stuff when searching (since I am cheap, after all). I finally noticed that the images have a small white banner that says \u201cPrime\u201d across it on the upper left corner. Problem solved\u2026 (you can also find it by looking at the \u201cmore ways to watch\u201d button. If the title is available to watch for free with your Prime account, it will give you that option.)It\u2019s early yet, so I haven\u2019t had much time to explore all the different options but as of now I\u2019m giving it a big thumbs up surrounded by 5 stars with whipped cream and a cherry on top.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/6", "author": "M.

It is clear that the Fire TV is doing something in the background because the video slows down then speeds up to catch up.  This happens randomly, perhaps 3 times per movie.-Scrolling through movies and TV shows horizontally is a massive pain, as I can't see very much at a time.  I should be able to change views so I can see maybe 9 titles at a time and then page through.  The scrolling animation causes plenty of eyestrain as I try to zip through, looking for something worth watching.-Content is not 100% there yet.  Many popular movies are missing.-I am a Prime member, yet they want to sell me the movie/show even though I can just press play and watch it for free.-For whatever reason, playback can sometimes switch to SD.  I'd much rather force HD all the time, then have the option to pause and let it buffer.  Bandwidth is not the issue at my end, but obviously during peak times the internet and perhaps Amazon's servers might be overly busy.With all that said, the reason I bought this was to gain access to Prime stuff in HD without having to buy a \"supported\" TV.  I have a home theater projector, and dealing with HDMI audio splitters is a pain (i.e. Roku).  So having optical out is what sold me and I'm happy enough.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/6", "author": "JRod"}]
