Plugged it in to our 4 year old Sony and it was awesome...until it wasn't. Then we got an error message that \"HDCP Content Disabled.\" Called Amazon and the customer service rep said, \"Well, If you don't have the latest HDCP on your tv, it won't work.\" What?? Where is that in the specs? And why did it work at all and then stop? We've moved the stock to our 5 year old Sony and it worked last night. Probably will have one more night with it and then it hours back to Amazon. Hugely disappointing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/5", "author": "Wabu"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I was very excited about the Fire TV Stick as a Prime member.  I am concerned that  several times it seemed to return to home when I went beyond a certain number of recommendations (less than the total indicated).  I am not sure if that is the cloud, my WiFi or the instrument itself.  More disappointing is there seem to be less of the movies and TV programs than when I was using my Kindle Fire HD.  I hadn't sought out programs for a number of months, but now I see there are charges per episodes of programs I previously had access to at no cost through my Prime membership.  Examples: Foyles War and Dr. Martin. So in conclusion: Fire TV stick is good and glad I have it.  May have some glitches to resolve with its use.  Disappointed with Amazon and apparent reduction in Prime membership selection.  Perhaps they rotate what is available.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Keith McWithey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's amazing.  I bought a Roku at the same time (deciding which one to give my mom for Christmas) - Running Netflix on the Roku was very sluggish like the processor couldn't handle it - on Amazon Fire Stick it's like buttah.  Not to mention Amazon has their own wonderful collection of movies and TV shows.  I was spoiled and pre-ordered it for $20 but for anyone out there looking for something that's fast and reliable go for the Amazon Fire Stick (or the Amazon Fire if you can budget it, I'm sure it works just as nice if not better).I was hesitant on trying an Amazon product for streaming content but I am more than satisfied and recommend it to everyone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Brett"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Was not very impressed with.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "oertwich"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like my FireTV Stick very much. I have only had to reboot the thing a couple times in a couple months and really have not experienced issues like some of the other users. My reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the search function, it needs to search all my content not just the Amazon content. Other that that I have no real problems, it is night and day Faster the my Roku 3. Thinking about getting the full box and stick this on the spare TV.  Best $19 I ever spent...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Tim Crafton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We currently own multiple streaming devices (Rokus; Internet connected TV; Blue Ray player). Once we went to the Rokus a few years ago, I figured I would NEVER need any other device that does the same job. I really couldn't imagine how anything could be better than a Roku. I bought a TV for our second home that came with a Roku Stick and I thought WOW that is great (small package that works just like the black Roku box and is integrated into the TV remove).Then - Along came Fire TV Stick! To be honest I am glad I waited to rate the stick because at first I would like have rated it only 4 stars based on the fact it needs an external power supply and the Roku stick does not.Side by side, the Roku stick and the Fire TV stick are both awesome products. As I said, the Roku seems to get all the power it needs off your HDMI port and the Fire TV stick uses a USB power injector that needs an outlet nearby and thus a wire running to the stick. Ahhh.... after some reading, I found some users were able to get power from the existing USB port on their TV and thus they didn't need the power block in an electrical outlet, you just plug the big USB end into your TV's USB port and the little end into the Fire Stick. I understand this only works on newer televisions that have enough power coming to the USB port.Performance - Fire Stick runs circles around the Roku players I have and even (to a lesser degree) around the Roku Stick. The WiFi picks up stronger; it is dual band; and IT NEVER BUFFERS (once the program has started) even though my ISP seldom delivers anything close to the speed I am paying for. Even with other devices running in the house the programs playing on the Fire Stick just keep streaming with ease.It offers some features that aren't available on my Roku players (or I haven't found them) like if you are watching a series it will preview the upcoming episode in the bottom right corner as the episode you are watching is playing credits and then automatically start that episode with no user intervention. I use Netfix; Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime for the most part and they all run great on it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Lester E.
