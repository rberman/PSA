[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This product is AWESOME!  I can easily access all the programs, movies, and services from one little gadget. I'm impressed with its portability--especiallly when I'm traveling. The fact that I'm able to use this product at any location means that it's super simple to install.

It is easy to navigate with the remote and the thing I like is it's portable. I can toss in a suite case and have it in a room with me where ever there is a Wi-Fi signal. There was hardly any setup, it came linked to my Prime account. Just select the Wi-Fi signal to use and off you go!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "PaysYourMoneyTakesYourChances \"Gadget Girl\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I honestly wished I never purchased this device. I consistently have issues with mine telling me it has no internet connection, even though I just searched and browsed through titles. When I am watching videos they occasionally cut off and return to the main screen or the video freezes but the sound to the video continues to play. The device is slow and lags. All in all I am glad that I didn't spend much on this item, however I wouldn't buy another one. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND DO NO BUY THIS DEVICE! With the connectivity problems and not supporting all the content I would like, I would suggest just buying the regular FireTV or the Chromecast. I have a Chromecast and I LOVE it.
