I also own two Roku 3 players and two AppleTV players.  I cut the cord on cable, so anything I watch on TV is either DVD/Blu-ray or a streaming service (iTunes, Amazon Prime, Hulu+, Netflix, HBO Now, etc.).  This is a decent streaming stick, and is very much like and AppleTV.  If you're an Amazon Prime member, Prime video and music seem to stream faster than on the Roku 3.  Amazon Cloud Photos load fast as well.  You can access your Netflix accounts and Hulu+ on this, but like Apple, Amazon's FireStick is a semi-closed ecosystem.  You won't be able to access your iTunes library on this much like you wouldn't access your Amazon library on an AppleTV.  It's still a great product, I love that it comes with a remote or you can use an app on your phone to control it.  You can optionally purchase a voice-controlled remote from Amazon, which I haven't tried, but seems pretty cool.The FireStick has two problems with it that prevent me from using it more than maybe once a month: the interface and lack of UltraViolet support.  The interface is just a bit messy to me.  I'd take boring and streamlined compared to its current look.  The lack of support for UV (UltraViolet digital copies that often come with the purchase of a DVD or Blu-ray).  This is where services like Vudu, Flixster, CinemaNow, and M-Go excell; they let you access and purchase digital copies that can be used across devices.  The FireStick has no support for any of these services, so if you have a digital library outside of Amazon's, you have to switch streaming devices.  The Roku devices end up being clear winners when it comes to streaming devices (they support UltraViolet libraries, Amazon's prime libraries, and many more channels).  The benefit of Amazon's streaming service is that they have a lot of movie rentals not available anywhere else, however, you can access them with a Roku.  As a stand-alone device, it pretty good and super-fast.  But it's lack of features and support for other technologies prevent it from being a great device or even In the competition.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Morgan Newton \"Super-Dad\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product, only be fore-warned, if your WiFi is not a reliable wonderful connection, don't bother.

I have an Apple TV and purchased through the Sling promotion (which is in itself disappointing) to get further to reaching my \"unplugged\" goals.
