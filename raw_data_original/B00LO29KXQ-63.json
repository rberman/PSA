I rebooted a few times but nothing changed as far as access. It did finally (after a few re-boots) come up with an error message that said that my wi-fi was too slow. I ended up going to my laptop to finish an Amazon Prime movie series without any problems. It didn't make any sense since my laptop had no problems on the same network and was in a different room to boot. The stick is right next to the wi-fi so I think that it might be that there is something to do with the stick's processor itself and it might be heating up with extended use ... hence failure. If you are getting off paid programming (like I am); I suggest that you look elsewhere.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "thumb1999"}]
