[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Still learning how to use it.  Pleased with what it does.  We are planning a trip to Ireland, and many of the documentaries, or Irish themed movies are one way to prepare for the change in culture. It seems that when I add \"free with Prime\" movies, shows, documentaries to my watch list, within a week there is a fee to watch them.  I suppose what is free and what is only for purchase or rent changes, but when that happened it was a disappointment to me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product!!

I installed kodi with some creative measures requiring a bit of cmd know how.The problem I have with the stick is its wireless connectivity. The stick loses connection frequently and buffers often through kodi, Amazon, and HBO go. I have other devices including my roku in the same location that handle the wireless connection much better.I wish I would have went with fire tv instead of the stick invade it had better wireless. Hopefully improved firmware will come soon or perhaps Amazon will offer a new model replacement when it launches the next generation.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jeremy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "mainly used by my teenage daughter.
