Initially I would have given the Fire TV Stick a full 5 stars, except now Amazon is inserting commercials into some Prime TV and Movie options. Commercials for other Prime choices isn't necessary, as there are plenty of ways to pick viewing options: The Prime Fire Stick menu, Amazon's Instant Video Page and My Prime drop-down box. Shoving Amazon original series' down my throat via commercials isn't going to encourage my viewing: it's actually a turnoff. But as of now the commercials are minimal, thus are not frequent enough to stop my enjoyment of the Fire Stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kristen Howard \"Literary Shark\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G.
