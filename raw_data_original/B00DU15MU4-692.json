[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE IT,  LOVE IT,  LOVE IT! Kids love it too. I can't belie how much money this thing can save you, if you cancel cable. We will be canceling it soon, we couldn't find a football app, so we held on to cable, but it's bye cable.You can watch anything you want whenever you want (except football). It is not all free. You'll have to purchase apps, subscriptions, etc, but still so much cheaper than cable.

We have had two other streaming devices and this by far is the best we have had. The quickness and the voice search are amazing!  We have had an Apple TV when the second generation came out and we have had a Tivo and neither of them performed like this Amazon Fire TV. We are very happy with it and it suits our family. It is lightening fast and I am happy to see there are tutorials on YouTube that show in detail how much more it can do. For us it is perfect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dogpaws \"faux gourmet\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "So far sling TV doesn't work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Jake"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating.
