[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very convenient.  If you have Amazon Prime its a must have.  Streams are high quality and I have had no buffering problems.  The Stick provides older HBO and Showtime programs, Disney Channel, and Hulu+ (I'm a member), so for me it replaces the overpriced cable bills.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Blake"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The fire stick is everything it claims to be.

This Fire TV stick is great overall, but I always have to unplug and replug every time I want to use it. That's a drag. Otherwise, a neat gadget.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Yorkiefun"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "For the price I paid ($19.00 introductory price) it's ok.  I do not like the clumsy Amazon interface.  Do like the ease of downloading.  Would not invest in the Fire TV box due to my dislike of the Amazon OS.  Overall I like the Roku line, stick & box, better.  I would not replace this at MSRP of $39.00.  Too many other options at that price point.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MDavis"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "There is no explanation of how to connect to Netflix, etc.  I will have to call either Netflix or Fire TV.

Easy to use & install app. Multiple choices for apps including soothing scenes & music as background.
