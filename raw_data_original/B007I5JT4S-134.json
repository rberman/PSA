I like the Apple TV although I wish it had apps for streaming Amazon Prime. The feature to AirPlay from my other Apple devices is convenient and I can get streaming Amazon prime instant videos that way.The product is practically plug and play. The remote in my opinion is way too small (maybe 5\"Lx2\"Wx1/4\"H. It doesn't fit well even in my small hands and it's easy to misplace. Not ergonomic at all. The buttons aren't labeled well, basically there is a play/pause button, a select button, directional buttons and \"menu\" button. The menu button also means \"back\" and play/pause also means on/off (although they aren't labeled as such. It takes some practice.Honestly I find the Roku more user-friendly and it is quite faster when navigating through menus and playing selections. I like the roku feature that allowes a headset to be plugged into the remote for private audio. We just had a baby and it's nice for my husband and I to watch something without waking the little one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Av8her"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Living in the Apple eco system or not this is the streaming player to have, set up took under 10 minutes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Crab"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Good but needs a built in browser.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "James"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "anthony andrews"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bummed that Apple reduced the price soon after my purchase but that is my luck.
