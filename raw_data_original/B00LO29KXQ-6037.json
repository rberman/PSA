[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I plugged it into a HDMI in the back of my AV Receiver. Set up was quick. Found my wifi and connected and it updated the Fire Stick right away. Whole set up time was less than 10 minutes. I have Netflix and Prime also. Works great (no lagging) and sounds really good through my AV Receiver. The remote works fine with the stick plugged in the back of the receiver, does NOT have to be line of sight like I have seen on other reviews. Not sure why they would say that.Glad I got it.

The interface is also very slick and the voice search (Android app) is awesome. The only issue was set-up ... the software download stalled many times and no clear instructions or help on Amazon website. Finally, I followed the suggestion on reddit and used the HDMO extender dongle at which point things started working. I am still using the dongle and not directly attaching the stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this for my old 720P LCD TV that is not compatible with chromecast and it works!  The setup took about 20 minutes and that included the update. So far so good streaming Amazon video, Netflix and ESPN.  The remote is a nice feature to have.Note: I did the pre-order from prime but couldn't wait till Jan so I got mine at Staples on sale", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "zd"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very simple to install.

The remote is cheap. Luckily there is an app to replace the remote. It is nice to have 8gb of storage. Other than that it is basically a chromecast. Nothing special.
