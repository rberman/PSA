[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Definitely not an awe-inspiring perfect product but by far worth the price! Was not impressed that it always has to be plug in to an outlet. Was definitely not impressed with the wall adapter design sent with it, and will never use it. Why have an adapter that the cable comes out the bottom so it has to be in the last slot of a power strip?! With all that being said, i would still purchase this product again and will probably purchase as Christmas gifts. The product functionality is great and very seamless. I have watched 3 movies on it in 2 different locations and never had it buffer. I also like that all my music is on there to play whenever I want through my surround sound system. The games is something I am glad is on there and I am sure I will explore them in more detail soon. Great product Amazon!

Problem was that we were using our Nintendo Wii for the kids and a Logitech Revue for our two TV's.  The speed of streaming is blazing fast, and I love all the additional features including the games and apps.The only negative is that the parental controls only apply to TV shows, movies, and rental capabilities; and whether you restrict access to those features.  There is no program rating restriction (G, PG, PG-13, R) that you con choose.  When this becomes possible on Prime Instant Video, this will be the best device period.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Benaiawannabe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great !

I orig ordered beginning of November and after waiting patiently found myself like other pushed off till later in Jan 2015. I was able to obtain 2 today and was excited to set it up... After attempting the first device found after it forced the updates I was getting a blank screen after reboot. (it actually flashes a white amazon logo then goes blank) I then called tech support who advised me after little methods to try to attempt setting up the second device... After setting up the wireless and again running the update to this device I now had \"BRICK number 2\". Both brand new devices out of the box unusable and after several calls and speaking with a supervisor was informed there was no next level of support (with out waiting 48hrs etc) REALLY??? Obviously the updates are killing these devices. I was going to try and exchange them for two more if I can get them but I highly doubt there are 2 lemons that I rec. I can believe there is like no real support and the only solution is to have potential refurbished units sent. I am returning these two directly to the store. I really want to try and get another but sure I will just get burned again. I even tried to get a straight answer if the firmware would be updated on the replacement devices they would send but was told they didn't think so.... I would advise to wait until they have a more stable product as I am sure once the unit is out of warranty you will be stuck holding the bag!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "8/13", "author": "Ama Zoon"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "setup was simple and video instruction very helpful. Too bad you cannot use usb connection for power source. Need more video apps, Vudu and HBOGO would be great, more cable apps needed.

Easy setup...10-15 mins to install/update/register.  WiFi in our bedroom can be spotty, but this has been working flawlessly so far.  We've noticed only the slightest lag time with the stick vs our Fire TV in living room...and this is really only on start up.  Considered buying the voice remote, but decided to try the Fire TV Stick app first...it has voice search and works great!!  Another reviewer mentioned issues with remote needing to be in line of sight with stick & within 5 feet, but ours is plugged in behind the tv & we can aim the remote in the opposite direction of TV from the hallway outside bdrm (TV is on far side of room) & it works perfectly.  We've never used Roku or Chromecast boxes/sticks, so we can't make comparisons to those.  So far we've been very happy with our Fire TV, and the stick is a great new addition and bargain.  Will be purchasing more of these for guest room & studio.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "10/12", "author": "M.

I bought this so I could use my computer for work, and have Netflix playing on the TV in the background and did not want to spend $100 for Apple TV.  It was very easy to set up, and the picture is perfectly clear, sound streams through TV.One thing I was surprised about was that the USB device that goes into the TV isn't wireless. You plug the device into your TV, and then have to plug the USB device into a power outlet. This was difficult because my TV is mounted on the wall and pretty far from an outlet.  However, I was able to plug it into the back of my cable box using that power outlet. Just warning you this isn't some wireless device like it appears to be.Overall, this is a great product, it allows me to use my computer and stream Netflix at the same time, so I couldn't be happier.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Kate"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "First off, I purchased a chromecast out of necessity and how it would work for what I need it to do.  Luckily, amazon had an email waiting for me detailing the new amazon fire tv stick, for half off if I preorder... Awesome-sauce!  Placed my pre-order and returned the chromecast.  It is everything I expected. It works like a chromecast but with a remote and dedicated software/apps. It has the feel of an android phone with the apps.It is very nice, easy to use, and well worth the price.I bought 2!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Brandon"}]
