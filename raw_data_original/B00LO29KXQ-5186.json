[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is amazing! Not only does it work well, the quality, color and clarity of the picture has improved as we watch our favorite programs.

In particular, WatchESPN and HuluPlus constantly crash or freeze or black out.  Check the reviews for those apps on Fire TV Stick specifically and they confirm my assertion.  I tried every troubleshooting method possible and nothing resolved the issue.  Both of those apps work flawlessly with my Chromecast.  And for reference, I have a 50mbps internet speed, so that was not the issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "t-mac"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I'm pretty frustrated.  It's constantly cutting out and buffering or telling us the network is too slow. I'll run a speed test from my computer and we'll have anywhere from 25-40 mbps and no other devices running.

It took a bit longer to set up than my Fire TV box but not much. My daughter downloaded the app for her smart phone and now has all the functionality of the remote that came with my Fire TV box.Collectively our family really enjoy both the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV and give them both 10 thumbs up", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Oldman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it! so easy to use!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Phuong Tram"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works awsome . No probs.

However, the mirroring function does not work with my Apple devices and I bought the Fire TV Stick in hopes it would work with them.  I guess I should have read the description more closely before I spent the money for this, which would have been a great value if it worked with my Apple devices.  I can only hope that Amazon will develop an Ap that would provide that functionality.  If that happened, I would be able to rate this device much higher.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Terrence Paul Ott"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So Smmoth. I mean the device works awesome. Stays connected! A must for Prime Members! If you have other devices connected to your HDMI port(s) and have  limited  ports. Order a switcher/ splitter now. Use the ac connector with the device. Happy streaming!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "R.Crenshaw"}]
