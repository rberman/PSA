The first night I could get Amazon prime to load quickly nothing else would. Since I no longer have prime I didn't watch anything but noticed how rapidly it loaded compared to Netflix. Hmm....interesting.I could never get Netflix or anything else to work, even though my internet connection was fine on my computer and phone.  Tonight I was able to go to Netflix and tune in radio but could not even watch or listen to one program due to the constant buffering. I can watch Netflix on my computer with no buffering so it's not a WiFi issue on my end. This stick is crap and I'm returning it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "avid reader"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Super great for Prime members. HBO collection alone is worth it. Only problem is a green flicker that occurs every couple minutes. Makes it unwatchable. Have to turn everything off and then back on, only to have the green flicker return after a couple minutes. After a little research, find a work around by turning off \"pixel orbiter\" on my Panasonic ST50 tv.

I like it better than Chromecast. I like the little remote and that there is an app. This is amazing. SO awesome. Use this to watch TV in one room of the house, we use XBOX one in the other.
