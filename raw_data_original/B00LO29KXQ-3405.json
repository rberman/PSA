Now that it is, I'm very happy.  HOWEVER, I still keep it at a 4, as too often I lose wi-fi signal and too often the HD reverts to SD so I'm watching a grainy movie for intermittent periods during a movie.  I would still recommend to anyone interest in this type of device", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LEMONFRESHDAY"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Could not get my smart phone to recognize the fire stick on my network, working on problem. otherwise, ok works fine", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Raymond Green"}]
