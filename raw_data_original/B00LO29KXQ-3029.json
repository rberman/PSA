I was completely dissatisfied in the Amazon Fire TV Stick. I immediately realized I did not care for the \"way too small remote\". also, I immediately realized I did not care for the on screen menu nor its functions. and it seemed everything offered revolved around Amazon Prime!to further my disappointment, as I moved thru the on screen menu, in several cases, the screen froze up on me. also the Fire TV Stick got very \"hot\" while plugged in to my HDMI port...........now there is nothing wrong with my TV or my Wi-Fi cable connection.very simply....I did not like it!I returned this Amazon TV Fire Stick back to Best Buy where I had bought it. now i have done a lot of research or investigation on streaming media devices...rather than exchange for another Fire TV Stick to see if it might work better. I decided to go for the ROKU 3!the ROKU 3 works perfectly. as of now I am very happy with the ROKU 3 in every way. to me there is no comparison what so ever between the two. the ROKU 3 blows away the TV Stick in every way!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "john f. clifford \"clark case\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ashani C.
