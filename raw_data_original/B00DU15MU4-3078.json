The answer is a resounding YES!Having just purchased the Amazon Fire TV and having tried many other streaming devices \u2014 including the Roku, Wii, XBOX, Apple TV, Chromecast, TiVo, Slingbox, Belkin TV, and smart TVs \u2014 I can say that the Fire TV is a must have for any value-oriented TV watcher.To understand why, it\u2019s first important to remember what the Fire TV and other streaming devices are competing against.The simplicity of watching TV is has helped to make it a habit in most homes \u2014 turn on the TV and video begins playing right away. No need to change inputs, no need to wait for the TV to load (usually) and generally no network latency issues. Occasionally, you have to suffer through a grid to find something to watch, or channel surf using your remote control, but it has been brain-dead simple for many years.  DVR usage has also become more prevalent, and when there is nothing to watch on TV, it\u2019ll just take a few more taps on your remote to start watching your DVR. If there is nothing to watch there, you\u2019ll spend a few more taps yet again to tap into Video on Demand offered by your cable provider. Therein lies the opportunity and challenge \u2014 while it\u2019s easy to just turn on something to watch on live TV, it takes a few more brain cells to and some patience to find something to watch on DVR and VOD.Each second (or partial second) waiting for streams to load significantly reduces the consumer\u2019s desire to stream content to their TVs, even if it\u2019s free.  We\u2019re creatures of habit. We\u2019re at home at 8 p.m. wanting to watch a compelling TV show and the extra time it takes to change inputs, wait for the box to turn on, find the show, and then wait for the video stream to see it on TV is frankly too much work for most TV watchers.This is one of the ways that Amazon\u2019s foray into the streaming box market has nailed it for the consumer. Amazon has made streaming significantly easier with an ultrafast box, plus voice search on your remote control.In my tests, the voice search worked really well \u2014 even with ambient noise in the background. For On Demand viewing, this is much faster than any current set-up that I have, including my cable set top box, smart TVs and other streaming devices, including Chromecast. Amazon preloads content so that it immediately begins streaming instead of having to wait several seconds to start playing the content. The responsiveness of the box, the voice search, and the no-wait streaming are the best you\u2019ll find out there.Using the Fire TV immediately after opening the box is impressive. I was up and running in less than 5 minutes. No logins required. They already shipped with my Amazon Prime and no setup was required other than wifi. (Yes, I was a little surprised there wasn\u2019t an HDMI cable.) I know cold starts on many of the other boxes were either overwhelmingly long or way too technical for the mass market. Amazon set the bar very high with their cold start.For Amazon Instant Prime subscribers, this was far and away the best way to stream Amazon content to the TV. Unfortunately, the other streaming boxes that stream Amazon Prime require just a few more steps than I\u2019d like to see. I have to find the app, launch it, then wait for the app to load and then select my content and then wait again to start playing.Fire TV is \u201cinstant on\u201d to the Amazon Prime Instant Video catalog and with a short voice search, you\u2019re watching content immediately.There are quite a few things that are lacking, but given Amazon\u2019s reputation and business model, I expect that the box will be future-proof for a while with additional software updates. One of the biggest areas where I believe Amazon will innovate is Universal Search. The current search mechanism only searches across Amazon\u2019s library. So, if you search for \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d you\u2019ll get a bunch of non-sensical titles.I believe that Amazon will extend this to be a truly universal video search, similar to how their e-commerce website treats third-party sellers. If you want to purchase an item on the internet, Amazon\u2019s goal is to get you to always start with Amazon first. If you choose to purchase from a third party, that\u2019s fine as long as you started with them first. This also happens with product reviews: Users may search Amazon first and then choose to buy elsewhere.  By ensuring universal search across all video sources, Amazon will create more utility for users and build the trust necessary to always start with Amazon first. I expect that they will do this soon.The second area for improvement is in apps. Most people don\u2019t know what they want to watch when they sit down to watch TV \u2014 the challenge then is that consumers will have to navigate Amazon\u2019s menu using up/down/left/right on the remote to find something to watch or find another video app to open and attempt to find something then.Amazon has launched a companion application on the Kindle Fire, but there is no support for iOS, Android, or Windows yet. The smartphone or tablet is one of the best ways to find content because you can use gestures and navigate quickly while the TV may be tuned to another program. I expect that Amazon will expose their catalog and all the 3rd party catalogs in a companion experience on multiple platforms to make it easier for people to find, discover, and launch programs on the Fire TV.Amazon will turn smartphones and tablets into a software based remote that will allow for voice search, driving users to consume content on the Fire TV. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if later users could use the soft remote to launch pay TV programming as well. This would deliver a \u201cwow \u201cexperience for consumers.The video ecosystem is very confusing for consumers \u2014 programming windows, TV Everywhere, On Demand, Streaming, DIAL, Smart TVs, etc. Fire TV is reducing a lot of complexity by making one catalog very user friendly and fast. It\u2019s worth buying just for that reason.However, the future is even brighter for Fire TV as the hardware is designed for next-generation TV experiences (and perhaps to a greater extent, gaming experiences) that will change the way we interact with and consume TV in the future, for the better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Andy Liu"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I won't purchase this without access to HBO Go.

The fast-forward and rewind have some weird function that stops the video while it moves in either direction, so it's more like a skip forward or skip back, and they don't move very fast in either direction either.  Besides being kind of small, the remote has a very nice rubbery coating to make it easier to hang onto and avoid finger prints.  It's just the wrong size for my hands - no matter what I'm doing with it, my thumb positions are in the wrong place when I hold it.  The voice search seems to work nicely though.  I haven't used it much yet, but so far it has been very accurate.  (my American English speech has no kind of accent or inflection and I've been told it's very clear normally anyway.)In comparison to my old Roku (very old model N1000) it's much better.  I haven't used any of the newer Rokus yet so can't compare to them.Oh, the remote's Bluetooth pairing is a bit of a problem if you want to use the remote with any other devices.  When the Fire-TV goes to sleep and the remote isn't paired, you have to unplug the Fire-TV and redo the manual pairing again.  It's a pain, but the remote unit works great with my tablets.  But, if you just leave the remote paired with the Fire-TV as normal, it restarts quickly.  MUCH more quickly than the old N1000 Roku.  But that thing is VERY old - though still works OK for the old tube-TV in one of the bedrooms.If you're on the fence, I'd recommend giving or getting the Fire-TV first.  I don't think you'd be disappointed.  Besides, this thing is actually brand new, already works great - and the Amazon functionality is only going to get better.  There will likely be a LOT more 3rd parties jumping on really soon, too.  The developer environment looks very inviting - even for the tech hobbiest.Updated 2/24/15 - just a quick note about the remote batteries - my remote came with Amazon Basics batteries, and died in less than 10 months.  My other remotes generally tend to last between 18 to 24 months.  I've replaced the supplied batteries with Amazon 1100mah rechargeables.  I'm hoping these will last longer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Neo, the renaissance man \"s/w designer in a h/w world\""}]
