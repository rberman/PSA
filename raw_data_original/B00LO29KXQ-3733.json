I can easily open the battery cases on all the other remotes I own, but I actually bruised my thumb trying repeatedly to slide open the battery cover in vain. I actually had to take the remote with me when I went shopping and ask a large, strong stranger to open it. It took him a solid 5 minutes of working at it before he was finally able to force it open. I can't be in a situation where I have to leave home to find someone strong enough to slide open a simple battery cover. I even returned the original Fire Stick and remote, thinking that the remote must be defective, but I've just received my brand new replacement and I'm having the same problem with the new remote. Clearly it's a design problem. It's a shame; other than that, the Fire Stick is wonderful: the setup is quick and easy, the user interface is intuitive and simple to use, and the price is right.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "wolfemom"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Sadly my experience was completely different than those with a successful streaming through the Fire stick. I was truly looking forward to see Amazon's original content which is the main reason why I bought this instead of going with Apple TV. The first stick didn't work so after troubleshooting while on the phone with a customer rep, Amazon decided to replace it. 2 days later same issue but different stick. 1.9 hrs on the phone was not enough to fix the issue. Both sticks have been returned with no clear explanation from Amazon about why none of the sticks worked. Disappointed mostly because you bet for company like Amazon to deliver and offer a more affordable option but sadly I just confirmed that by paying the extra buck for Apple TV will give me the quality that Fire Stick lacks.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "iDork"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Fire Stick Not only do I use it at home but at work, I work at a Country Club and when we have children activities This is so convenient to plug into the TV and watch free movies.
