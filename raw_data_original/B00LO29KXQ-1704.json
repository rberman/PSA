I preordered for the $20 and I think it was a good buy but not great. For the speed and variety of services I just think other options do it better.  I have high expectation of Amazon products and I think this still has a lot going for it and potential to be better as features and services are added, but as it stands it just doesn't stand strong enough amongst the competition.If you're an Amazon prime member then this is still a decent buy, but I think it is worth it to pay more and get something that already has all of the features this doesn't as of this review.  I will update this review should I find reason to.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "I Like Stuff"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wasn't sure what to expect from this. I must say I am very pleased with my Fire TV Stick. My youngest grandson loves to watch videos on YouTube with his grandpa. I am now able to watch them with him on our flat screen HD tv. He gets quite animated over certain ones. I am really looking forward to watching Netflix and Huluplus from the comfort of my rocking chair instead of having to go upstairs to the spare bedroom and watch on my computer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Trudi Basso"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Horrible product.

For the price and compactness, it's a great media device to own. The only thing that originally had concern with was the fact that it gets hot; however after research and continued positive reviews the Fire Stick is a solid little device.
