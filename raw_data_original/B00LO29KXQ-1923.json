There's now a section for prime-only videos that can be searched. The netflix interface is very easy to use. The whole system works pretty good. Could it be Better? Yes. It is definitely not the most intuitive. There could be a static home screen like on a mobile device where you know where your apps will always be, in the order that you left them. Some apps (I'm looking at you hulu and youtube) could be better written, less buggy, and better integrated (web only episodes, hulu? You do realize that anybody with half a brain can watch whatever they want on the T.V. so that does nothing but annoy people and make them want to drop your sh*t, right?). However, those aren't necessarily problems with this device as they are problems with the app developers. I wouldn't say it is the best entertainment experience on the market, but for around $40 it does an extremely passable job.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great access to Amazon and netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "katcomb"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am so happy I ordered the Amazon fire stick!
