It would constantly flicker in and out. The set-up for the Fire TV stick was fast and it performed well initially, but after about a week the flickering problem started happening with the Fire TV stick, as well. Not as bad as with Roku, but still annoying. I've tested both on other TVs in the house and the problem still occurs. My other streaming Roku XD and Sony Blu Ray player's apps rarely have streaming issues and never have this flickering in and out fading to black. I was also disappointed that HBO GO and NHL Game Center were not apps and the app library seems rather limited compared to Roku.The mirroring capability was also a pain to set-up. It took many tries before my Galaxy phone and Tablet would appear and the picture quality of the mirroring was not great, although the streaming from the phone didn't flicker at all. My Amazon Music also took hours to sync up.Although these sticks are portable and economical, you're better off getting the more powerful streaming player or a Blu Ray player that has apps. I just don't think these sticks have the juice to keep up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got this as a gift for Xmas and am obsessed.

I am still getting used to it. At times though it does seem a bit choppier than my old Roku. This only happens on certain apps though so I am not sure if it is the provider having the issue or not. I had other issues with my Roku and the same provider. All in all it is amazing what is packed into the stick and I am happy with it for the most part. When they ask for the password when setting it up it is just the same code you use to put anything else on your wireless network.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rick from Maine"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Markel jones"}]
