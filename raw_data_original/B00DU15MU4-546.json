Although there are several streaming boxes out there nowadays this is still what we considered to be the best for the money. It may have some features you will not make the most use of, such as the games, but it offers the opportunity where others do not. Full disclosure we are PRIME members so this was a key factor in OUR decision but likewise we use it for Netflix and Hulu. We recently got rid of our cable tv and simply upgraded our internet to allow for everything to be streamed. This unit is great as our living room tv is \"dumb\" and the samsung bluray player while wifi capable is buggy at best. This has seemlessly played our PRIME content which our little one loves and we have enjoyed the movies and tv shows with no issues. The control is great and voice search feature functions very well. The keyboard input is smooth and responsive the only better option would be to have an acutual keyboard connected to it, but in instances where there is a lot to type you can typically just use the voice search.The unit is fast and responsive, no issues to complain about at this stage. We have been very happy with our purchase!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Edgar"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Purchased at half price with a sling bundle. Unit is nothing to write home about. We already had roku's in each bedroom.. used this to try out in the main room. Seemed to be the same as roku.. nothing that stood out or any 'advantages' over roku.Wouldn't buy another one in the future based off current model offerings.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

I previously had been using a Wii to play my Netflix and Hulu with, but am so happy I found this! Plus I can listen to my music on my Prime Account, surf the internet, watch YouTube videos, play games and do all kinds of other things with my Amazon Fire Tv!

Simple install with the Sling Tv has enabled me to ditch my cable provider and no longer fight for promotional pricing from the cable company.
