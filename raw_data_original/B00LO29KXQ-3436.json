Includes a USB2-to-USB2 micro cable to power the device. However, this usually does not provide enough power for the device's built-in WiFi card to connect to wireless router that isn't located close to the device. But, it also comes with a power adapter if you need it. I recommend using the power adapter. Amazon provides a wide variety of TV and movies for your enjoyment through Amazon Prime. It's a good deal since you also get free two day shipping on items ordered through the Amazon site.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "regapal"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have used the Fire TV Stick for a couple of weeks and so far it's great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Venice Swayzer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great works great and easy\ud83d\ude0a", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "GREG GENTRY"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I was very excited about this device when I received it. But poor user experience and points below just made me a frustrated customer.Why I would not buy this device:1) User interface lags significantly specially after you use this stick for more couple of weeks without restart.2) Many apps would crash without reason not sure if its poor framework or bad apps.3) Remote via mobile application looses connection and fails to reconnect. There is a reason they are giving you a hardware remote (its not just for convenience).4) Miracast: I was so excited about this feature but it was the biggest let down from Amazon. I spent countless hours to make it work only to figure out that it doesn't support windows laptops. Mirroring your phone screen doesn't provide as good experience as laptop would.5) Slow updates: Many features you would see are \"Coming soon\". I have never seen a single feature that was on \"Coming Soon\" list released yet.6) Selection of apps is very limited. Roku has the best selection specially for media. No DishWorld, HBOGo, and others.7) For some reason I have to turn on my TV volume to more than 50% to even normally listen to the content. Output volume is extremely poor.8) Most of the menu's are amazon's content (about 40%). I would say stop shoving your content. Many useless Amazon's menu items.Why I would buy this product:1) I bought it on the day it was released so got it for a good price. 40 is way too much for the functionality it offers. Again, Roku has much better selection of apps.2) Cheap stick to watch Netflix, Amazon and other channels content in case if you don't have Smart TV or similar stick.3) Access to Amazon's content because they refuse to release an app for mobile devices or laptop.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "8/8", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I had the device installed in 5 minutes.
