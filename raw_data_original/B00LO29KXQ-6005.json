Setup seems to require that you have the \"One-Click\" ordering enabled on the account - I did not and the registration kept failing without any on-screen suggestion as to the issue.

I was hoping I could sell or regift my chromecast, but I will definitely be keeping it. The quality of image from Chromecast has been vastly superior to what I have experienced with the Fire TV stick. I also find that Chromecast does not have the lag that I'm experiencing with Amazon's product, such that Fire TV stick buffers every few minutes, while Chromecast does not through an entire program. I was especially excited for this product because I wanted to really take advantage of my Amazon Instant Video, but the picture quality and streaming times are so poor that I'll just continue to watch prime video on my kindle.
