[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "My daughter bought this for me for my birthday. I really wanted it to work because I wanted to cut Comcast loose. However, the first day it froze twice right off. Also the programs we watch are not included on the Prime list. They are all programs some young people watch but the one we watch cost $3 to % per session. At that rate I may as well pay Comcast.Really disappointed..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Ginch"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Purchased to stream xbmc and add ons.  Performs well and was easy to get started.  Would've been 5 stars if Amazon had allowed the direct download of SPMC, which is available in the Amazon store.  Since Amazon has designated SPMC as incompatible (which it is not) SPMC has to be sideloaded.  Once sideloaded, it works great with Gotham.  I have also used it to stream from PBS (not using SPMC) and it works flawlessly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carla D"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Thank you!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Sherri Houston"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The unit is nice and small but picture quality is not great.
