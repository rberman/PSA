The remote control worked fine, but as soon as I wanted to do anything that required connection to the internet, that is where this product didn't even earn a star. I tried downloading an app last night and the router for the wifi was literally on the same tv stand as the tv with the the Fire Stick. I tested the internet speed to make sure that it wasn't an internet speed problem and i was testing at 23mbps. for those who don't know, that i plenty fast to watch HD on at least a couple of devices. The fire stick would download the app, it lost connectivity about 4 times. Finally it did it. but then when i went to watch ESPN, it looked like is was broadcasting in 360. All fuzzy and blurry, and buffering after 5 seconds or so of viewing. So then i switched over to my apple tv which also runs off of wife, and ESPN came on in full HD and didn't buffer once.I have seen the roku and appletv in action and support those products. but this fire stick has given me problems from the start. I thought it was slow because at first i had the fire stick around a few walls, so i placed the router right next to it and it had the same problems.But if you like horrible connections and the temptation to throw the remote at the TV, then this product is for you! (by the way, i should note, i LOVE Amazon and their products, just not this one)", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Karen L Strong"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The features and apps are great, but it is too slow.  When you press a button to play/pause, select, etc. sometime it will take multiple seconds before it responds.  Often just becomes unusable.When it works, the picture quality is great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "alightled"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.

Sort of annoying.. Is there a way to clear cache or reset? Maybe that'll spring this device back to speeds.. for now my Roku has never had issues... and I prefer it due to lack of buffering and quicker response.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Roch Rx7"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love being able to watch on the go! I take this everywhere with me now. The only thing I thought was odd was that you don't need to turn this off; it just remains on as long as its plugged in. Just enough storage for my needs.

If you have xfinity on demand and HBO you really don't need the fire stick.

Took me about an hour to figure out setup and discuss issue with customer service.  The customer service was good.  However, Amazon should know its American consumer base better and not ship German language default products.  It can't be that hard to figure out based on address.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "joshua berger"}]
