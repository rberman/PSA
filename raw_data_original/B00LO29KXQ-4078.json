Works like a charm and setup was a breeze!!!  You just have to remember to not have a brain freeze and go into tv settings when you're done watching the show and reverse the HDMI and Component settings!!!!  It's still easy tho!!!!  Who needs Hulu or Netflix or the others.....they all seem to be offering the same diet!!!  If you have Amazon Prime the Fire TV Stick is a no-brainer!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Thought I would be able to use it in Hotels with wifi... but there is no browser page to connect.  That was the only thing I was going to use it for since I travel all the time. But now I will have to get Chrome cast. And use my computer with hdmi to watch things on Amazon since Amazon will not work it out with Chrome cast to let them use their amazon prime app!  Something has got to change... either Amazon gives them their app or comes up with something better themselves.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jacob"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "velmon franklin"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Wifi is the drawback. Stick receives 5 out of 5 bars consistently. 20' from router 1 interior wall between them. But why the buffering. Content is fantastic though. Wifi signal is strong in my house.
