At first, it was unable to connect to my WiFi, but using the HDMI extender cable that comes with it solved that quickly. The initial update was a bit of a pain, seemed to take longer then it should but it wasn't terrible.After the initial setup, things just worked. No problems since. I'm running all the basic apps you'd expect (Netflix, Showtime, etc) and have side-loaded apps with ease from the play store, but the Amazon store more then covers the majority of my needs, even AirPlay. The biggest app I was missing was Dish Anywhere, and now I'm content with my setup (although it works poorly without a touchscreen). There's an Android app called WuKong Remote that worked perfectly with Dish Anywhere. The FireTV Android remote seems to work well, but it's not a full-fledged mouse, and can't interact with Dish's app.The HDMI-CEC capabilities of the device are a nice touch.The only problem that I currently have with the device is how the main interface displays apps. It feels unintuitive and side-loaded apps are only accessible from the settings (unless you use FiredTV launcher or dummy apps). They're not deal-breaker issues, just mild annoyances.Overall, I'm very happy with the FireTV stick, glad I picked one up!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven Rolfe \"Steve\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Cons:Miracast (wireless display) only works with androids..which kind of sucks. does NOT work with windows 8.1 tablets or computers.No app for windowsphone.You have to use the power adapter and cable that came in the box.Pros:Everything else works smoothly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "NavC"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "This thing seams to be made for androids I have an iPhone and I wanted to mirror my phone but it didn't Returned it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "David Parker"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "IT WAS EASY TO GET UP AND GOING.

So far, this is suffering from the same growing pains that Chromecast did when it originally launched. Few apps. Sluggish video playback. I hope the ecosystem and the device will mature as Chromecast did, but for now it is very much an inferior product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris Weidner"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Worth the money.
