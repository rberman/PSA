I'd say try one at first and then buy the Fire TV Box to expand the possibilities of entertainment. I have Comcast at 55mb per second and sometimes it buffers a bit when using Netflix, reason unknown. I believe it is the providers connection and streaming capability in my area since this happens on my other devices too. That being said, this device provides a good introductory to the would of streaming video and games plus apps at a great price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin P"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is great!!!!!

Almost all of the advertising images and the product shots show the USB being simply plugged into the tv, WITHOUT the cord that has to be plugged into an outlet. When I first saw the product it was from an advertisement showing a hand plugging just the USB into the TV which made it seem like a wireless product. After being surprised when I opened the package, I re-looked at the product page and saw a diagram (near the bottom) that shows the additional cord. This is my fault for not doing my own due diligence, but I also feel like Amazon is falsely representing the product in the majority of the product pictures.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jenette Donovan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "everything works just like you said it would its great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "robert butrum"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great, great price, and customizable with being able to side load unofficial apps.
