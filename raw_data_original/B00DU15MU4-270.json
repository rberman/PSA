[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really enjoy Amazon fire! We get to watch a lot of awesome TV without al the cost.However... I don't think much of the remote! The remote is nice with all its options but the sleek design makes it way to hard to hold on to! We've dropping it more often than I care to say. I now use the remote app on my phone so I can watch tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Howard"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It's great. The remote is responsive and the box is very fast. There are a few down sides. There aren't very many games. Also I wish there was an option to search on the apps using the remote instead of typing everything in. But overall its definitely worth buying to leave in the living room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LinhLam0502"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product!

When I became an Amazon Prime Member, streaming Amazon from my I-Phone to the Apple-TV just didn\u2019t make since. Every time we would get in the middle of a show, my phone would ring, the show would dump and my wife would have to sit and listen to me chat before we resumed the show. The Amazon Fire TV is the be all to end all in my house. It\u2019s the best of both worlds, Netflix and Amazon uninterrupted. We Love it !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.
