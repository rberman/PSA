The remote is rather difficult to use and takes some time to get used to. I have one in every room in the house rather than a cable box. Do yourself a favor and pick one up, then install Kodi. Kodi can not be installed on any of the other devices from Amazon's competitors.The only real downside is it's need of 1A, 5V, which forces you to run a cable to wall outlet rather than be able to run with the power off the hdmi. But that doesn't take away any stars in my opinion.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Oryana Villegas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Meets all expectations", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kenneth Boudreau"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "works great,wireless speed is great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gary"}]
