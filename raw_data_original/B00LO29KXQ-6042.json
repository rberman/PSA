I received it about two weeks early. The interface is better than the Roku and any other blu ray player that I use to stream. It is also very efficient and hidden away. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for their first or another streaming device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Frank Pressel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire stick meet my expectations. The setup was very easy. I've been using it without any issues.

I didn't notice that it needs to be plugged in and since it does it could use a longer cord. I bought two and I had to set up the WiFi twice for both. You would think that a new product would show up up-to-date. The apps are great.  I would love a keyboard for it but so far the phone app works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Setup was a little convoluted with the update installing right away and having to put in my wifi password twice.The interface makes looking for new shows a bit odd.

Forgetting competing products for a bit (I own both  Chromecast and Roku), I couldn't be happier with this streaming device. It's very easy to install, has great WiFi connectivity, and very fast operation with the included remote. If you watch Prime videos, NetFlix and Hulu, this device is a no-brainer - it's the price/performance winner.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jim Logan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent device and I love how fast it is.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "manuel"}]
