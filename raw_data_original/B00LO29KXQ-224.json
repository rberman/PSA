With wireless being the only network option, I have seen some latency issues with all three services, but nothing bad enough to warrant returning it.  With Plex, I have actually had shows stop and go back the show menu.

The unit will not allow HD playback without losing connection, however a Roku XD plugged into the same port on the same TV in the same exact spot  works flawlessly. I bought the Firestick to replace an older BluRay because it was cheaper than adding another Roku. Got what I paid for.
