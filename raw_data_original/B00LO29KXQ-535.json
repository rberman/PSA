The only downfall is that many of the apps are still not compatible with certain cable companies (I can't use the showtime app because it doesn't offer Charter as a choice for cable providers, etc.).  That would be the only thing to make the Fire Stick better, along with an Xfinity app (there just isn't one for the Fire Stick, but there's one for my kindle).  But I just mirror my kindle with my tv and can watch everything that way.  Therefore, if you don't have another Amazon product, like a tablet, you should go with another streaming device.  Otherwise this is one of the best purchases I've ever made, I don't know why people still have cable!As a sidenote:  the way this product is listed it misled me to thinking that the voice command remote was included.  It is not, you have to purchase that seperately, just fair warning.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Audra O'Brien"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is very comparable to the Fire TV!

I was thinking of making this purchase some time ago but had to wait for my satellite TV contract to expire.  I do not recommend this for those who will be using it with satellite internet.  I am making the switch to something else (AT&T; U-Verse or Cable internet) since the satellite internet cannot support the data needed for streaming.  This was probably one of the most simple tech gadgets I've ever installed.  I look forward to utilizing it's full potential when I move into my new house with the different internet service.
