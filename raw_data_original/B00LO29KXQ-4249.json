The problem being that it rarely worked. To start I had issues with it when it connected to my internet. The screen would freeze up and nothing would happen. This would go on for an hour or more. Then I finally got it working, and as I scrolled through the quality programming on Amazon Prime, my TV shut off. Weird... but ok. So I turn it on and try again. TV shuts off again. So the remote buttons for some reason turn off my Vizio TV. No problem! I have a Kindle Fire HDX (which I love) that can control the app. It works fine for 2 days, and then the stick stops connecting to my internet... not just my internet, but all available open networks in my area. It won't connect to anything at all. So I'm returning it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to start a movie.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Linda Lambertus"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "OMG...I Love It...Just what I wanted....THANKS", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "OhioGrammyOf3"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Just started checking it out so far I like what I see", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eugene Westland"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's a very good option for my yupptv app and it's awesome for prime customers but only one thing is we need to another remote to play games and sometimes getting slow or struck prime videos.
