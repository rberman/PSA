I am actually buying this exact same thing as a gift for someone else. I love how the pictures on are my screen savers on my TV.

We bought the Fire for our main tv upstairs and the Fire stick for downstairs. The fire stick is a complete waste of money. I can only watch Amazon on it. Netflix won't open and when it does I have to sign in again every time. Hulu doesn't work at all. Have been trying to watch a 45 min program and its taken more than double that! The screen freezes or goes black and I have to go back and resume again. Most of the time resuming again makes the show totally start over. If I try to fast forward it's more black or frozen screens. Absolute crap product unless you only watch Amazonj", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "2/5", "author": "HansenOya"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This has quickly become my media player of choice.

Kodi(xbmc) is worth the price of admission by itself. It runs great. Unfortunately, I couldn't get hbo go running on this device (the play store version runs fine, but with no mouse you can't sign in/control the app). The amazon version doesn't even open (get an error). I still like chromecast for certain things, but like Kodi on the fire stick.

The only problem I had was getting the battery cover off of the remote.  It streams much faster than my blu-ray and it is much easier to navigate with the voice remote.  The price was wonderful.
