[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have been able to get it to connect 1 time to the internet since I bought it 2 months ago. I thought it may be my internet so I borrowed it to my mom and nothing. Could not connect. Also you need to plug in into the TV which I knew but that if had to be plugged in to a outlet also was a bummer. If you want any help with it GOOD LUCK!!!!!! I thought maybe there was a setting that I could change to get better luck but the manual that come with it basically tells you plug it into you TV and the wall. If you aren't getting a good signal add the extender to it. I had my router sitting behind my TV and that was still not strong enough signal. I have very fast internet for everything else. (use the XBOX and a BluRay player and they are perfect) Bought this to have something easy to move from TV to TV.SAVE YOUR MONEY!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Heidi Hemmesch"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to connect and use...even for the tech-challenged.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Donna Maness"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "yes... it was so easy to hook up to my TV and use ...It couldnot be any simpler...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "barbxcats"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was skeptical of this at first, but decided to purchase when there was a good sale going on.

Download the latest software. We like the Menu system better than Roku 2 that we had.Hotel Experience: FIRST, we set it up at home, then we updated the software from home. Only after the update will it allow you to use it at a hotel.  At the hotel, at first it didn't work. After re-seating the 120V plug and plugging back into the physical HDMI 1 port on the hotel TV, the hotel TV menu finally came up as it recognized a new device. We selected INPUT, then HDMI1 using the *TV remote* (not the Fire TV remote.) For a few seconds it said something like it could not contact it's servers. Don't exactly know what that meant, but 2 seconds later it flipped to the hotel login screen that you normally see on your laptop. We used the Fire TV remote to login using the on screen \"keyboard\" and the hotel login information that they gave us at the front desk. Viola! it worked beautifully as we got a Fire TV splash screen and then the menu we saw at home came up. Everything was as we experienced it from home from that point.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "a0188279 \"Engineering Mom\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use.
