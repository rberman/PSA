[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I'm so bummed that this didn't work on my TV :( Everything was going well the first week or two I had it (I preordered it when they had the 19 dollar deal), but then my TV began making random a loud buzzing noise intermittently. When the random buzz happened, the picture would also free momentarily. It made watching TV for long periods of time impossible.I confirmed it wasn't my TV (which is what I thought at first) by doing a few tests: I muted my TV and no buzz came from the TV (which it would have, it was the TV) and the picture did not glitch either, I changed the sound settings both on my TV and Fire Stick to see if that might be the problem and that didn't help, and finally I set my old Roku back up and the buzz problem completely stopped.Besides the problem it caused on my TV (a new Insignia LED TV), I really liked the Fire Stick.  I wouldn't be surprised if this is a problem with other TV sets too. Guess I'll go buy the new Roku.

My TV goes black then pops back on trying to search for the proper resolution, even when the Fire stick is set for 720p.

Like some others, I bought it on the advance sale for Prime members at $19.00. It was schedule for delivery by 12/16, but got it 10 days earl (an automatic plus!) So quick and easy to set up and within 15min I was kicked back and watching Hulu+, Netflix and my Amazon Prime videos! Not much of a gamer, so I can't speak for the game apps.The only negative aspect is the lack of HBO Go, but that's due to restrictions my Time Warner (owner of HBO) But I also have theKindle Fire HD 8.9\" and I have no problem with HBO Go on that, so no big loss.  I just upgraded my main TV to a 55\" smart tv anddidn't want to pay for additional cable. Wasn't sure I'd keep my old 32in TV but now it's got new life in my bedroom and I get towatch TV in bed!!Update 14Aug2015 - Okay I loved this when I first got it but after several months, I'm so frustrated with some of the apps on the Fire TV Stick.Hulu and Netflix constantly freeze while I'm watching. I don't have this problem with my Kindle Fire HD (2013 version) or with my Samsung Smart TV or Samsung Blu ray. I've tried to delete and reload the apps and even restarted the Fire TV Stick but no change. If it happened across all my devices I would blame my internet but it's only with the Fire TV Stick.  No problem with Amazon videos or other apps, just Hulu and Netflix (surprise...I use these the most!) It may have been just because I got the pre-order and all the bugs weren't worked out. I wish I had sent it back right away, but not buying a new one. If I do, I'll probably switch to Roku", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mikey718"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Need to restart fire stick quite often after switching off television.

After testing that one I canceled the online order.  This is an Amazon Prime device primarily, with additional apps available to give you access to other services such as Netflix.  The difference in accessing Prime content and Netflix connect, built-in function vs app function, can be confusing.
