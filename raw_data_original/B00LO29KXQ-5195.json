I wish there were a bit more of a unique library to Amazon Prime TV shows and movies that set them apart from Netflix, but there enough shows streaming on Amazon Prime that aren't on Netflix that make this device worth investing in if you like streaming your entertainment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adam Kantor"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike Patterson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!
