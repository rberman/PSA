I am not sure if user error was part of the issue or if it was something else.  But for the first few weeks we had a really hard time using this.  The screen would jump from one channel to another and would not select the channel selected.  I honestly don't know what we did, if anything, to make it stop, but is now working great.  I really enjoy the different channels and options for use.  We have not explored all the options, but we like it enough that I am planning on getting another ROKU that will work with any tv.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because of the original issues we had.  I recommend this to anyone I think would enjoy it and a few people I know have either already purchased one for themselves or are planning on getting one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Have many issues with the remote losing connection to roku.
