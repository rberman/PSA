I have had Apple TV for years, but Amazon Fire provides much better audio for streamed movies and TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David M. Baldinger"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fast and responsive.  I like the FireTV over the Fire Stick as the FireTV has a direct Ethernet connection to the network.  Although the WiFi works very well (My daughter moved it to her room for a while), I prefer the reliability and bandwidth of a wired connection. The Stick gives you the same interface, but occasionally appears jittery while watching a movie, or playing games; even with a very, very strong WiFi.I've had each plugged into the TV (at different times) but now have the FireTV plugged directly into the home theater receiver.  This reduces cabling issues, as well as one less remote needed.  But for the bed room, kitchen or den, the Stick is great.  you just plug it into the tv, supply electrical power to it, and you are set to go.  IMHO the FireTV is well worth the extra money on a static installation.I have used AppleTV, WD Live, Roku, Samsung Smart TV apps, and for the past 7 or 8 years, have had various PCs (running WMP and streaming) connected to the TV.  Over the years, I have spent a ridiculous fortune on BetaMax, VideoDisks, DVDs, Blue-Ray disks, and players, 3D players (PS3 is probably the best 3D blue ray player), streaming servers and receivers etc:  AmazonTV is really, really impressive.  For about 125 bucks (with a game controller), you get a great selection of free movies, tv shows, and games for the kids, and a box to play them on.  (How much did you pay for your first VCR? not to mention the tapes!)And yes, you can sort and search for Prime only (meaning FREE) content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "AuthenticGeek"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Learning as I go.
