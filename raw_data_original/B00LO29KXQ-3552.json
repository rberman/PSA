I have been an Amazon customer for a long time. I use Amazon video on my current blu-ray device. The interface of the Fire Stik is ridiculous and hard to navigate. The connection was s***...and we have lightning fast internet. And the charger....yeah, it requires a charger...sticks off the side of this thing and makes it very difficult to \"hide\". Yeah, no. I'll stick with using their services but Amazon should stop with the electronics. Kindle is great. Kindle Fire is ok. Everything else is a glorified turd. I didn't even bother returning it. I'm just going to keep it incase my other tech crashes and I need a quick fix for a very short time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Scott A. Broadbent \"Moon Knight\""}]
