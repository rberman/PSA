The fast access to movies, music, and games makes it a perfect option when we need to fill free time. The music almost always has words with it too, and that is wonderful for some of the residents who are a little forgetful. All in all, more senior friendly programming would be wonderful, but this device meets more than enough of the entertainment needs for our residents and that is what is important!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Allie W."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Really only oriented towards Amazon Prime.Which actually was the reason I bought it.
