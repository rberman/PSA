As soon as they logged in my computer went crazy with virus warnings and I could not log in or out of my computer. Then finally she came on the line and I was able to proceed. She put me on hold for 2 minutes and supervisor came on the line and told me I had virus and I needed security software issue and they would sell me for $190 before I am able to install my Roku., I told him I was not interested after which he said I owed him money for this technical support and advise I had security problem I told him forget it then he hung up.After that got new activation code and followed instructions on my TV screen and was up and running in 5 minutes.WHAT A RIPOFF TECH SUPPORT COMPANY ROKU HAS!!!!!

I have a firestick, a chromecast, and the roku stick and the roku is my second favorite behind the firestick. Amazon's Fire stick has a nicer feel in the hand and seems to respond much quicker. My roku stick seems to take a really long time to boot up. Also the buttons don't feel as nice. Both are better than the chromecast which works only maybe 50% of the time and always needs updates.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "P0e_Dameron"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It took too long to set up and was hard to connect to my internet.

So far it works as described if plugged directly into my TV's HDMI slot.  Set up was easy.  It experiences very frequent lapses in the signal, however, when plugged into an HDMI signal splitter.  This makes it far less convenient to use than I had imagined, as I also use my laptop as a tuner and cast that signal wirelessly through an HP Wireless TV Connect, so need HDMI expansion.If you have a TV with multiple HDMI connections, I think you will be very satisfied with the Roku stick.  Set up and response is quick, interface is pretty simple.  Menus are geared to Amazon and MGO content, but there is a dedicated Netflix button. I don't have experience with other Roku systems for comparison, but there are a couple of very comprehensive reviews on site which explain the advantages/disadvantages of each.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kitty sama"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Bought this item in Oct. of 2014.
