[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I keep having connection issues. I used the HDMI extension, resetted the device, and followed the steps on the help page but nothing works. I have cellphones and computers close to the stick and they have strong signal and perfect connection. When the device finds the network it says it has strong signal, but 2 seconds later the network is gone. When connected I can't even use the device because network speed is too slow. Netflix keeps loading after 10 seconds watching.I'm disappointed by this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tomas S."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Opens one up to other options beyond cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul R.
