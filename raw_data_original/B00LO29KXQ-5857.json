[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have several Rokus ranging from old low-end ones to the latest Roku 3 around the house and have highly recommended them to all my family and friends for years.  I also have 2 chromecasts.  I also tried, and returned, the Roku speedstick.  The Firestick is the best on the market so far.  It it way, way faster than anything else.  No buffering at all most of the time, and very short buffering the rest of the time.  I don't have real fast internet (<3mbps) so buffering is always a problem especially if trying to watch in HD.  With ASAP built into the Firestick, it learns what you watch and pre-buffers stuff.  The startup time is phenomenal and the screensaver pictures are fantastic.  Everything about it works perfectly and I would now recommend these over the Roku.  The only two things Roku has going for it over these units is 1. you have more channel options (I only watch Netflix and Amazon movies) and 2. you have a USB input option on the Roku 3 and the Roku 2 in case you want to run a flash drive or hard drive with pictures or movies on them (but you can also use the Plex channel on the Roku or the Firesticks to play them from your computer).The Chromecast sticks are very limited in what they can do, and they have no remote control.  They are good for one thing, streaming a website off your computer, and even then, without a remote control, they are not user friendly.  This is the streaming tool you should buy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Spydie"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Purchased the Fire Stick at the promotional price for Prime Members, so this really made it a great deal.  The fire stick was easy to setup and does make it easier for me to access my online content (primarily Amazon Prime and Netflix) via my TV.One neat feature that I was pleasantly amused by was when you play music (from Amazon) on your Fire Stick it provides you with the Lyrics to the song... just like a karaoke machine :)The major issue that I've had with the Fire Stick is the lag and sometimes glitchy interface.  I've had to reset the fire stick a couple of times because it became unresponsive.  Minus 1 star for this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Mahalo Amazon!"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It was advertised as providing the ability to mirror the display of Kindle devices. After I purchased and installed it, and it did not work, I found out (after a lot of useless work and research) it only mirrors displays for some Kindle devices. Even though my KindleFire HD is less than a year old, it's not one of them. I did not buy it for video streaming so I should return it, but it's not worth the hassle.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "gene connolly"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I was so excited. My rural area has only recently acquired DSL fast enough to stream and I had caught the first day bargain price for the FireTV stick. I had no problem setting it up. But then it said it needed to download updates and the !&)? thing would not stay connected for the download. The directions to try unplugging it did nothing. So first day reaction : total disappointment. The next day, after Amazon customer support replied that I would have to call for help,  I sought advice from other owners and saw how many people were having the same problem. So I moved the TV as close to the router as possible and read a book while I restarted the connection over and over again until it finally stayed connected. It's almost like it was getting a busy signal from the server until it finally snagged an open slot. It took about 1.5 hours on slow DSL to complete the download. Then I found out that all those apps they tout?  Each one has to be downloaded separately. So day 2 -- still not finished setting up. Today, day 3 -- I finished getting my favorite apps -- PBS, history channel, etc, moved tv back to where it lives and had no signal problems there. The only small disappointment was finding that I couldn't access the amazon prime music channels that I've been enjoying on my Fire. Prime music, yes, playlists, yes -- but not the channels -- at least not that I can find.So after too much effort and a lot of frustration, I'm actually happy with the final result. If you have a lot of patience, it's a great deal.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!

It's just good enough that since  can no longer return it I won't throw it away.  The playback is hit or miss.  At times it is choppy, pauses and then speeds up.  At other times I get a blue screen saying content is not authorized.  Still other times it just flat out kicks me out of whatever I am watching.  The stick itself gets very hot with use.  They try to pack a lot in a small form factor and that's the problem.  I don't need something the size of a thumb drive.  I need something that actually streams well.  A box the size of a sandwich sitting below my TV would be just fine.  Stick to a Roku or Apple TV.  You can get Amazon Prime video on the Roku and you can Airplay Amazon Prime video from an iPhone or iPad to an AppleTV.There are seven buttons and a directional pad. Yet you felt the need to subject me to a several minute introductory video to show me how to use it and worse advertise a bunch of other amazon garbage. Even if this turns out to be the best streaming device ever, the fact that I cannot skip this is inexcusable and merits a one star ratingUPDATE:  The layout is designed around Amazon's needs not the user. Rather than launch to your channels  the home button opens to a screen that provides you an opportunity to purchase more content. Also if you are an Amazon Prime member your watch list is actually separated from the Prime Video page. Makes no sense. If I had paid full price I would return it, but for $20 it has just enough usefulness to make returning it too much of a hassle. Unless the Fire TV box has a different layout I would not even consider it. Both Roku and Apple TV are much better. Roku has an Amazon Prime app and I would rather use my phone's Amazon Prime app to AirPlay to my Apple TV than use this Fire TV stick as my primary streaming media source.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Guy"}]
