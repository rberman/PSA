I like it a lot more than using other things out there like Roku, and I don't connect it to my macbook or iMac.  So I like there, but there's 2 problems with the remote.I hate the remote. My hands are small and my thumb barely fits in the middle. IT's sleek and looks nice, but in the dark I and I bet you will all of a sudden hit enter instead of up/down/left/right once in a while.. or all the time.. Apple can do many cheap solutions to solve it, such as put little plastic dot on the up/down/left/right (where you already see the white dot.  so I know where my thumb is. Or they could seperate it further (which they wouldn't do). Also they could/should make it LED on the remote for using it at night. After one touch of any button led lights could come on. then it goes back into sleep mode after 30 seconds.  The remote also messes up and takes my iMac out of SLEEP MODE when I use it on my tv, and I have NEVER connected it to my iMac. So thats weird. Also, screen sharing sucks with the apple tv. I put my macbook pro onto the apple tv to watch a basketball game and wow is it terrible. And it's not my macbook pro or my internet connection with a speed of 60.  After all that, I still really like the apple tv.  Ever since Steve Job has passed, Apple doesn't quite think things through, like copying the iPhone to samsungs as far as size curved perimeter. Sure.. make one phone bigger, but at least leave one phone be a classic iPhone.  don't make one huge and then one practically a mini iPad. Steve jobs wouldn't have done it I know it.  He's a thinker.  Now on the iPhone 6 or 6 plus its hard to use their back button thats only on the top left. Its now a 2 hand device instead of 1!! also, i loved how iPhones were more boxy or square instead of curved before version 6.  They wouldn't plop out of your hands so easy and you could have a nice grip. Also they fit in your pocket much easier. Also those little important things gone!! Rant over! It's just I love apple like many do and they have the money and potential to continue to be the best by far and are messing up as of late in my opinion and it ticks me off.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nate S."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "ok", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adelbert Legasto"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I purchased this for my parents so they could use Netflix and HBOGO.  Both of them are very non-tech savvy so it is important to get them easy to use devices.  Surprising both were able to operate the device with ease.  The remote only has a few buttons so that helps simplify things for the user.  We have not really explored all of the features that this offers but for Netflix and HBOGO it works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt55"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent. Thank you", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sandra Henning"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought the Apple TV because I had purchased some videos on iTunes and wanted to be able to watch them as easily on my TV as on my iPad.  I wish I had purchased this sooner, because I like to watch HBO Go and it is SOOOO easy to do on the Apple TV.  It took about 5 minutes to set it up and my Bose Sound Bar recognized it off the bat.  Like other Apple products, set up is easy for the end user.  So glad I bought it.  In addition, if there are many options of channels to watch.  Big things sometimes come is small packages.  I would also recommend it to someone who does not have a lot of extra space as the device is small.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "K.
