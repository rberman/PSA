It streams well.  I bought this stick for a 32 inch Sony flat screen.  I've had it only for two weeks and had only three pauses in the stream while watching a movie.  Great product!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sherry"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent.  I like the factor that it is small.  Also, the extender HDMI cable made connection to TV easy, without this cable, I would have need to purchase one because I did not have enough space to plug in the Fire TV stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alphonso Powell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Liz Carney"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Plugged it in & it started working.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul E.
