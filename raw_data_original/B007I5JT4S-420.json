It has worked great so far with no issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jamie E Bishop"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you have an iTunes account and some other Apple products in your home, this item is almost a necessity.Setup is very simple, plug in the power cord and connect an HDMI cable to the TV. Viola! Done! The operating system on the AppleTV is intuitive and simple to navigate. It ties directly into your home network and your iTunes account. Anything you have purchased via iTunes can be accessed on the AppleTV.Additionally, if you have an Apple iPad, iPhone or Computer, you can utilize the Mirroring or AirPlay functionality of the AppleTV. Mirroring allows you to share the screen of your device on your TV. For example, you should display the screen of your iPad on the TV screen. So if you were showing photos to family of a recent trip, you could show them on the TV rather than people needing to gather around your computer or iPad. Keep in mind that Mirroring and Airplay on works with Apple devices.The AppleTV also has various Apps built into it. You can access your Netflix account, HBO GO, and other items from Sporting Leagues like the MLB.As a bit of a caveat. If connecting multiple AppleTV devices in your house or if you happen to have other iPad/iPhone devises in your house, be cautious of what you're streaming and sending to an AppleTV. I recently heard of a story where a young man was watching some rather \"adult\" oriented material and didn't realize he was streaming the sound to the AppleTV in his parents TV room.

If you can use AirPlay on any device (Apple or not), it should pair nicely with this.  It provides a very \"clean\" interface, and it's easy to rip videos (using Handbrake or similar) that will work on your iPhone / iPad which will also work on your AppleTVs.As for the negative aspects of the product, it's similar to any other Apple product.  The biggest disadvantages to the product is a tradeoff for the impressive UI and hardware design--you won't be able to plug in a USB jump drive with an XviD encoded AVI on it and expect it to play.If you use an Apple TV on a home network (or a series of AppleTVs), I'd plan on dedicating a computer to a stable iTunes server that holds your music and movies/TV Shows that you want networked so that you can take full advantage of the convenient interface.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joe Kiszka"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love having both!

The only con is that the actually remote is rather annoying. The way that it's set up makes it difficult to use otherwise works as instructed is awesome if you have an iphone or ipad to use it with so you can use the mirroring capabilities.
