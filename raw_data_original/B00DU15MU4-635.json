I wanted something that would be easy for her to find things to watch now that we got rid of cable. All she has to do is speak into the remote, and it will go to \"Spongebob\" or whatever she wants. The only downside is that it only seems to search for shows within Amazon's own app, and not on Hulu Plus and Netflix too.
