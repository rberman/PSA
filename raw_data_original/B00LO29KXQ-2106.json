Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO Go - basically every streaming service is available on the Fire TV Stick. It's an absolute must have if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber. The build quality of both the Fire TV Stick and remote are great.It also comes with a power adapter and HDMI extender. I have bought 3 of Fire Sticks and only needed to use the power adapter on an older TV (2010 model) because the USB port on my TV didn't provide the TV Stick with the necessary power. It takes up very little space and will travel easily.It is easy to use and very responsive. I bought one for my parents who were still using a first generation Roku - and the are loving the Fire TV Stick. Overall it was a great buy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Michael C."}]
