[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I ordered a new firestick, and when I plugged it into my tv, it came up registered to someone else. Clearly this was not a new product, but a refurbished one, being sold to me as new. I tried it anyway, and after less than 2 weeks it randomly stopped working. I went to amazon to order a replacement, but they said they could not help me with that and I would have to contact the fire TV support team. They gave me a link to a Q&A; page for firestick, with no way to contact the merchant for help. I am returning this product now and will not be ordering another one!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MS"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Remote control is out of order.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jung, Yong Joon"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice product, but the parental controls are an annoying joke. All the cool, hard to do features are wonderful... But you can't set a rating limit...

With the Fire TV Stick, you really don't need cable anymore. And I'd highly recommend adding Sling TV to compliment your Fire TV Stick experience since you can add premium live streaming packages for a very reasonable rate. Only problems I'm experiencing with this product are the Amazon Fire TV app which just needs minor tweaking with the search functionality and frequent disconnections from the network which may stem from problems with my ISP. Also not sure how to stream content from Amazon Prime Music from my Android device through the TV. Could be just user error, but not very intuitive. But all-in-all, this a very solid product and a great value. I have already recommended this product to friends and family.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "e3charles"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is very cool!
