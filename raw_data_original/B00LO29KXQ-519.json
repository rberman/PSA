It will say it can not connect to internet but wifi signal is strong then you have to power off or reboot it to reconnect. That tells me the software is crap. No other devices, including a chromecast on the same TV, have an issue on my network. After reading  other user posts online this seems to be a common issue with this device. Maybe amazon will fix the issue, but i will not hold my breath. but hey the packaging is nice.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bob m"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Outstanding Product and Excellent Customer Service", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anita Griffin"}]
