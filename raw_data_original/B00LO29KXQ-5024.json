When opening the box, there is a manual, a remote, a power cord and the HDMI 'stick'. Powering it on for the first time brings a bit of excitement as many of the Best Movies for 2014 flash across the screen. Being an Amazon Prime member I believed I could watch any movie and when I selected the Disney movie 'FROZEN', I saw that I would have PAY $9.99. Further investigation showed there are movies I can watch for free but they are all on Netflix, so why bother.Getting back to this little gadget, I plugged it into the bedroom tv, got in bed ready to watch a good movie. Buffering.... grrrh! Although I have high speed internet and my tv is a mere 45' away from the router, the little gadget is not strong enough to play anything.It does come with Cloud Storage for photo's and you can view them on your tv screen. It says you have access to millions of tunes, I am not even going to try. And of course if you find a movie you really want to watch, you have the option to buy or rent it. That is one perk over Netflix.I will be staying with Netflix (gag me with a fork), and getting rid of the Amazon Prime membership.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "C.

And when you do find something free to watch the commercial are the same ones over and over again.  Right now I do not see the benefit of having the \"stick\" any movie I find to watch is already months old and I have been out on red box for some time.  With Amazon Prime costing $100/yr and Netflix about the same, I'm thinking red box may be a better deal after all.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Larry W Myers"}]
