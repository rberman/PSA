Fire TV has been out for some time now and still doesn't offer IOS support or an app, though the site says coming soon as it has for months. The device also doesn't support Direct TV for Showtime on Demand; still no HBO on Demand either.While it has some use for Prime members and as a way to access Pandora and Netflix if you don't already have a way.This still leaves much to be desired.I'm a fan of Amazon and a Prime Member but this falls far short of the Amazon I'm used to.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.

Initially(through the first few days) there were some issues with buffering. It had to do it quite a bit. However, they were very quick, so it didn't bother me to much. However, those went away fairly quickly. It seems to be that way with each new streaming app, Netflix, Hulu, etc., but that all goes away very quickly. I should mention that the internet in my town is really terrible, The top you can get is 6mgb down, and I'm getting HD, and it looks good. Couldn't be happier with it!
