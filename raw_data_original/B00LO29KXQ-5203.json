Let me start by saying I own an original google TV device, the somewhat new ROKU Stick and now the Fire TV Stick.My comment is very similar to J. Scherrer. I received my device before the holidays to my great delight but I did not open it until after because I already own a ROKU Stick \"WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE!\" I wanted to try the fire TV stick to compare it and use on a secondary TV within my home.I initially plugged it in powered by the USB and I got an \"unsupported device\" screen marred in BLUE and GREEN vertical bars! I instantly thought that the USB power was not enough so I unplugged the USB power and used the power adapter, but alas I got the same result. The image was under a blanket of blue and green. This time however I let the stick go through its paces.Under the blanket of blue and green I could see the Fire TV logo so I logged onto my WiFi, the stick did an automatic update and went through its welcome screen. Clearly this was an output issue or so I thought. After about 30 mins of frustration and going through update and resetting cycles I was about to give up until I decided to try it with another television, and BOMB! Picture perfect! You would think this would make me happy but I was actually more annoyed! This is was not just an older and smaller TV but the same manufacturer! Why would the device work with an older model and not the newer one? I have no clue. Both of my TVs are PHILIPS.In any case I decided to call customer service to seek a replacement device in hopes that the device was truly defective. Short version it wasn't. The replacement device came and I've had the same result. I obviously don't know the tech details behind why the stick won't work with the newer TV but that's for amazon to figure out! I'm going to send back the replacement device and hold on to the original one. I got it at the intro $19 and it works on one of the TV's so I guess that's ok considering I paid half the price.My advice to shoppers:If you want a tried and true device, buy a ROKU. They are GREAT!My advice to AMAZON:Please work out the bugs before bringing the product to market.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "12/13", "author": "Errol A Browne"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fast at start up. Very good picture quality. Easy to install and good remote... A little different than the ROKU but so far better and faster for a fraction of the cost. Wireless excellent with Amazon prime, but for other search options you have to open eg Netflix too find the show you are looking for... So far happy with the purchase", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "R.
