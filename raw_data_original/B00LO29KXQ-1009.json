I love the Fire TV Stick and it is so easy to use.

Netflix and amazon Prime stream pretty seamlessly. Radio apps and Youtube are great too. I may never leave the house again. Wish it had an off button.

The connectivity speed is terrible. Our shows skip and freeze constantly, and it takes forever for shows to load. The Home screen, too, is not as user-friendly as Roku. About the only thing I like more about it than our old Roku is the screen saver. I do not recommend this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Alabama Reader"}]
