[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love this product, we can connect our apple products to the TV and can mirror whatever we are looking at.  It is great for showing off pictures to a large group.  You can also stream your videos from any apple products.  As a bonus you can also stream from your favorite apps. Great for the TV's that are not Internet ready and want to watch Netflix on it!  The negative i give it is that i wish the remote was a little bit bigger and easier to use.  There are only 3 buttons on the remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Anthony \"Anthony\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product on time delivery", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Louis Finkelberg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I honestly was really hesitant on getting an Apple TV. I didn't think I did much aside from being able to watch Netflix and youtube and my iphone stuff (since my TV is not a smart tv figured this was best option either way) but this little thing has so many more features then I expected. Really worth getting it as you can watch all your Cable on demand channels, use any of your favorite movie/show apps, connect your iphone wirelessly, and listen to all your favorite music. The quality and wireless connectivity is seemless and great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The module is working great, it's the remote that didn't make it past the second month.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lauren Martin"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It's good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "extremepfs"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Thanks for this item!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "SANTIAGO YANEZ YANEZ"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "No doubt.
