[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I did my research when deciding to cut the cable cord and switching over to streaming media.  The roku streaming stick completely went above and beyond my expectations.  It was easy to set up and use.  I like to remote, though having the ear buds would've been a nice bonus.  You just plug and go!  It's discreet and requires no extra room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.

I LOVE this and will be purchasing for each add'l tv. It is sooo user friendly. I'm really enjoying adding channels..soo many and I've found of useful ones..esp the cooking and wine channels.

I love it, with one complaint.  To have 5.1 audio it MUST be plugged into a receiver with an HDMI input; then an HDMI output to send video to the TV.  Other than that, I'm very happy.  Shipping was very speedy as well (had issues ordering from ROKU directly and a big box retailer, so I then did what I should have done first: order from Amazon).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.

So convenient to plug in the back of your flat screen.  I love it so much I gave one of these little babies to a friend who lives it as much as I do.Amazon streaming, (alpha house!!!) movies, tv, netflix, it's awesome.  Buy one!!!

I got it for my 6 year old's room because I didn't want any cords hanging down from the TV for her to yank on.  Setup was simple - plug it in, turn on the TV, follow the instructions - no problems what-so-ever.  There are a couple of things to be aware of when choosing a TV for this.  It *can* be plugged into a wall outlet, but it's much more convenient to power it via a USB port on the TV.  I had to search around a bit for a 32\" TV that had both an HDMI port and a USB port on the side of the TV since I was mounting it on a wall.  Also, make sure the USB port is powered (USB/IN) and not just for service like some TVs have.  Just FYI, I ended up choosing the LG 32LN530B, which fit all my requirements.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "K. Eppinger"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I read a Gizmodo review before buying it and it said that, compared to other Roku devices, some applications (like Netflix) would load slower. They do but you sort of get used to it. But what you don't get used to is the constant rebooting this unit experiences. When it's working, it's great. But it will reboot itself randomly whilst watching a movie or whatever and in different applications, so it's not a particular application. I was replacing a 1st or 2nd-gen Roku XS but luckily I didn't give it away and I'm seriously thinking of putting it back..  The UI is great on both.  C'mon, Roku, please fix this re-boot issue through a software update (I keep checking daily)!
