I've had many issues where it just freezes. I'm not talking about streaming issues, I'm talking about navigating the menu. When it does this, nothing but a hard reboot (pull the power cord) corrects it.Also, sometimes while streaming Netflix, the sound mysteriously quits working. The only fix is the same as above - hard reboot.These problems occur often. I'd say weekly. Amazon needs to fix this. It's probably just a software update, but so far, I haven't seen any indication that they are working on the issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steve in STL"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my fire stick!
