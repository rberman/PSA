Took me two days to figure out how to get access to Wifi and connected the selection of movies and shows offered wasn't any different than what I get through my cable provider and once I finish signing up for the different services I will wind up paying almost the same amount as my cable services.  So for those who are enjoying the product, great for you.  I would recommend person considering it weigh it out for themselves to establish whether or not this is the product for them.
