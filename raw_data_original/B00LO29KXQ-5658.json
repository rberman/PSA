[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "This works great sometimes, other times it is slow to stream and gives me a message to check my internet speed.  Well, I did check my internet speed, and it is uber-fast, so no p0roblems with my internet speed.  Don't know why it stops movies as they stream (very frustrating), but there is a problem somewhere unrelated to internet speed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "milmom&proudofit"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got it for $19.

It worked perfect for1 day ... now it is pretty much useless.  I am not able to keep a wifi connection on the fire tv stick.  My network is running several other devices with NO PROBLEM, this device either has no connection, or \"connected with problems\". Netflix won't even open, and prime videos play for 6 seconds between buffering.  I have checked the discussion posts and several users are experiencing the same issue.  There obviously needs to be an update rolled out, however the device probably won't stay connected long enough to download it!
