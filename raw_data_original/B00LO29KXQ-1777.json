At first I thought it was my Internet connection or the firmware on the Fire TV Stick.  Did the typical 'update firmware and reset back to factory' process but no luck.  Tried different TV, tweaked the home WiFi connection, whatever I could get my hands on to resolve the stutter during stream and ran out of options so now I just use other devices to get around it.  Strangely though, the Amazon Prime app works flawlessly during playback so that's good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KHCK512"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this gadget.

It seems to me that either the stick is too slow to pick up the fastest data speed I purchase from my internet local provider . I already pay for netflix and got to view some things through it  hooked up to my projector but it is really annoying to continually trying to retry no less than five times and embarrassed to say this can go on for hours all because their was some problem with access to  internet , especially when my kindle fire tablet , my no name cell phone my computer and even my security system can all access the internet and show real time footage or no to little  buffering of movies. It is also embarrassing for me because  went ahead and convince more than a hand full of friends to get one  ,even before I received mine . so the stars are for when it works as a smart device but the two less is for no prime movie access and internet failures even with the extension thing ( my internet wireless networks box is actually 1inch away and still  I have to cross my fingers ) . Am praying that someone would read this , show me what I need to do extra to access my free movies at least so I might save some face with all those that's comming to my kid party next month to see it in action along with my brand new projector ( viewsonic pjd5555w)  wireless outdoor experience.

With Prime membership there are so many movies that are free or heavily discounted, including new releases, that I can always find something to watch. There's TV shows, music, games, and apps too which, so far, I haven't looked at with any dedication. It works wonderfully on my Phillips TV, which is more than I can say for some of the movie programs that came already installed on the set. Having to reset my wifi every time I wanted to use one of the preset programs was a pain. With Fire Stick I just turn on the TV, select the source and BAM....there it is, ready to go!
