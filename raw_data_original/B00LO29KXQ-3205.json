[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Loving the Fire TV Stick so far.  Loads really fast and never get buffering like all the other sticks do.

Easy setup, downloaded netflix, crackle, and YouTube. Many free awesome apps, for streaming, and this is so much cheaper to do than xbox live, where I was doing the same things! Awesome, for the price, you can't beat it! 5 stars from me!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Helen Stevenson"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Background: Paid $19 for it when they were running a promotion, already had a chromecast but I figured why not.Original: It works pretty well with: netflix and youtubeWorks terribly with: hulu (has awful performance compared to the one available for the chromecast and I really don't understand why there is such a noticeable difference... the amazon hulu app freezes constantly and doesn't seem to stream videos too well [pretty choppy]). In the end, yeah that's on hulu not amazon but still, good lord amazon just let people access the google play store on your amazon devices.Doesn't work AT ALL with HBO GO: Yes they added this that's fantastic - - except if you have comcast/xfinity. Yeah, they neglect to mention that if you have your HBO subscription through that tiny little company called comcast, you can't use the HBO GO app with the firestick. Don'tcare whose fault that is, but don't advertise that you have HBO GO and then neglect to mention that it won't work for all cable providers.Updated Review (27 MAY 2015): Seems HBO GO is now greenlight with this device for comcast, so I've raised the rating to 4 stars up from 3 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Liviuslol"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far, it has been everything I hoped it to be!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dale J lewandowski"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Yet another streaming TV dongle that fails to deliver any worthwhile content.

Honestly, it worked fine for me for about a month and then I began to have issues with wifi connectivity. I tried every tip on their site to troubleshoot and nothing worked. At this point, I was annoyed but it was Amazon so I figured the return/replace process would be easy.How wrong was I? These Fire items must be special, because they have an entire fleet of worthless customer service personnel that will constantly pass the buck to the next department. And NONE of them will be helpful.I still have the stupid stick and am going to trash it and invest my money in  Roku or something. Very disappointed in Amazon tech and, more surprisingly, their \"amazing\" customer service that failed miserably to help me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!
