[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works pretty well. I have a roku for my boys and honestly; wifi on both fail randomly, you have to re-login on each once an app is uodated and the fire stick has more to offer over all. Not surprisingly, sure everyone knows that, but I definitely recommend this to roku any day. Too many perks to even compare the two.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "michael"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install and easy to use.

We already had Amazon Prime and we signed up for Netflix and we don't miss cable at all and save over $100 a month. The fire stick is very easy to hook up and use. It is easy to flip through the apps and find shows. I wish we would have bought this when it first came out!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "StanleyJ"}]
