I picked up the Fire stick primarily due to the $19 introductory deal for prime users and then ONLY because it was MIRACAST certified which is something I had been wanting to mirror my android and windows displays on the big screen.  Honestly MIRACAST was the one reason it made it worth adding yet another device to my mix as I can get to prime fine from Roku, Tivo or web.It took forever to arrive as it was a pre-order but the usage I read about while waiting didn't look good.  I got it last week but by that time it was fairly clear that to Amazon 'Miracast Certified' means 'we kinda sorted used miracast technology to support screen casting between our devices and only our devices'.  So it sat and the bag unopened... and I wrote an earlier version of this review as a rant to that effect.So, tonight I got it out and put it through its paces.  What it does well but there are two glaring omissions.  But to be fair I'll highlight the good first.The GoodThe install and setup are easy.  Definitely use the USB to power wall-wart. TV USB ports don't have enough power to drive it past the 'Amazon' boot screen.  It came already registered to my amazon account which made setup a breeze but really glad I didn't decide to give it as a gift.  Netflix was a quick and easy setup as well.  The device was slow for the first couple minutes then got zippy.  I'm guessing it was setting things up and downloading content.  After that there was no noticable lag.  The remote is nifty and apple like.  I already notice it caching content... I played a bit of a movie, exited out and went back to it later and it started immediately without having to rebuild the stream cache.  Both the netflix and amazon players use the preferred (by me) method of playing video at lower quality if they have to while building up a cache then improving quality.  Tivo doesn't do this in their streaming apps which can cause pauses early on until it gets a cache established.The BadThe big one for me is that THIS DEVICE IS NOT MIRACAST certified.  It doesn't work with my android or Windows tablets or windows computers that support miracast.  Google this for more info.  Saying this is Miracast Certified amounts to false advertising in my opinion and if I'd paid more than $19 for this it would be going back in a heartbeat on this issue alone.But that's not the other deal breaker for me.  There is no VUDU app or any other way to play ULTRAVIOLET titles on the Fire stick.  I can understand Amazon wanting to keep control of their ecosystem and not offer ways to play movies purchased other places.  Hell, apple lives by that credo... which is why I don't use their products anymore.  But considering that Ultraviolet versions of movies are included with most DVD/BluRay purchase made in the past few years not supporting their libraries is pretty much asking them to go elsewhere.  I have 50+ UV videos and have only been paying attention to them for a year or so.  In Other Words...  IF I CAN'T PLAY MY ULTRAVIOLET MOVIES ON YOUR STREAMING HARDWARE THEN ITS NOT MY STREAMING SOLUTION PERIOD.  Doesn't really matter how much I use prime or want to rewatch the 2 movies I bought the streaming version from Amazon.The GeekyThis is an android OS device at its core.  You can turn on debugging and allowing apps from unknown sources so you may be able to play with development on this thing.  Haven't delved deep enough to try loading an app although it would have to be done via the web as there is only one USB port and its used for power.So the bottom line...  if you want this to Miracast, go elsewhere.  The belkin stick or latest Roku devices.  If you have a UV library you can't play it here, so unless you want 2 solutions look elsewhere.  If you are a prime user and only buy into the amazon eco system then this is great, really cool, go get it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

I also own a Chromecast and Roku, compared to them the Fire stick is as fast in bringing the media on-screen and I like the fact that it buffers shows so there isn't that dreaded spinning wheel. The Firestick is positioned farthest away from the router and around a corner in the hallway, I was still able to get steady streaming. I'm totally satisfied with this little guy and considering I bought it at Best buy for $25 bucks, it was the best of buys!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JohnnyB"}]
