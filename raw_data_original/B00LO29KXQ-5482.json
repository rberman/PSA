I had a Chromecast and was frustrated with the wi-fi performance / choppy videos. The Fire TV Stick worked great; fast, simple and smooth straight from the box.  I watched a couple hours of high def video with no problem and it looked great.Only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is lack of iOS integration.  When the iOS app is released with voice and keyboard capability, it will add the next level of performance and I would give it a 5 star rating then.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeff A.

The fire stick is great and I was able to pick it up for $20 just like my chromecast.  I would only recommend the firestick if you have an amazon prime account. Without prime you are limiting yourself with this device.  With prime its great to be able to stream amazon movies and music or use my TV as a photo viewer with amazon photo backup. The fire stick has crashed once on me but I think Hulu was acting up and locked up on my tablet.If you don't have amazon prime then look at a different device like the chromecast.  If you have prime spend the extra over chromecast and get the fire stick but both are great devices and have there pros and cons.

Using it on my Sony TV. I stream from Amazon Prime and a Plex server on my mac mini. Fast response times, great video quality! Highly recommended on a Amazon Prime account and/or as a Plex viewer for sure! Like the bluetooth remote as well. CBS News, Watchup applications works pretty good for news and YouTube works good as well.

The best part so far is that no sign in was required.  Amazon had programmed my info into it prior to shipment.  So when it fired up, it asked if I wanted to sign in as ....  It's the small stuff like that which makes me love this little device.  Not having to use a remote to sign in with a long email and complicated password does make a big difference...at least for me.Within 1 minute of booting up I was watching a stupid this is how it works video that I couldn't bypass.  I found the Watch ESPN APP and within seconds was watching Denver vs. Cincinnatti.  Still watching it, crystal clear reception which I can't say for my Apple TV TONIGHT  that kept giving me playback issues.  Did I mention no additional login for ESPN NEEDED?  ie cable TV provider login not required.  It just went straight to full access to ESPN!2 problems.  The remote needs to light up.  I watch TV in the dark and although the remote has 6 buttons, I need to see them.  Also, I don't like the power option of mini USB to USB power supply.  I got lucky and my power strip is just barely close enough.  I had no idea this thing needed plugged in.  I just thought it got the power from the TV.I have a 3D LG TV and this device will Simplink to it meaning just going to the input will turn on the TV and device at the same time.  Love that too.So far, all movies and TV shows on Prime have been as \"instant\" to play as possible.  Meaning, as soon as I hit play, the movie or show starts.But I still love my stick and can't wait for more apps.  Loving the NFL Now and Hulu Plus apps also.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.
