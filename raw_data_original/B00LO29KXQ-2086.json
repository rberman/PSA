The remote feels like a 99 cent product but as long as you don't have \"Hulk\" like hands it works just fine. I may get the Fire TV box  for my main viewing TV since it has more memory and keep the Stick for my bedroom TV. Otherwise, this is good value for the money spent.

Well, it only works if you're in the US, not my case.Also installing apps outside the US is a real pain, you cannot install through the device (???).After hours and hours trying to get a good connection (did not work on my ASUS Dual-Band Wireless-N 600 Router RT-N56U, had to enable my ISP router, awful) and a few more hours trying to install some apps, I finally got a Netflix Streaming Device, 'cause it's basically all I can use it for.Other than that, it's fast and the controller is good, makes it easy to navigate. If you need to use the search function, you can use the phone app, which makes it a lot easier (nice feature).", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Felipe Sales Cochi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's like a traveling Kindle Fire TV.
