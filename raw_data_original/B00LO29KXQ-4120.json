One issue that i'm fairly certain is our tv's issue: even if the stick is set to \"sleep\" the TV still thinks it's getting data and doesn't go to sleep the way it normally would if you had the input set to a cablebox or game console that was off.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kiki"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I LOVE it!
