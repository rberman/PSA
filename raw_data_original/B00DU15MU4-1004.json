I already had a 1st generation Apple TV that does many of the same things, and while I could have easily bought the latest version of the Apple TV, I was aware that Apple was scheduled to introduce a new version later this year so I decided to wait.  The Fire TV is very easy to set-up and navigate (much like the Apple TV).  One downside is I am not easily able to download all my songs and playlists from iTunes, though I can move 250 songs from my iTunes to the Fire TV through the Amazon Music feature (more than 250 will cost you $25 per year).  I have the same issue with moving my pictures from my iPhoto.  Ultimately, I will probably also buy the new Apple TV after it comes out, but the Fire TV still offers some nice features.  The voice activated search feature is neat and seems to work well.  All in all, for the price, this is a worthwhile feature for those looking for television entertainment features not readily available on a standard TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "JimWohlsen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own two Roku devices and recently purchased the Amazon Fire TV.
