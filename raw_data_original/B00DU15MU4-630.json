It doesn't. I returned it because the Roku had more apps the we use.Suggestion: You should compare the Roku, AppleTV and the Fire TV for the apps you would use most and the version/features could be different i.e. Plex on Roku is much nicer then Plex on the Fire TVPro: Really like the voice control for searching for content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alan Waldron \"zBrain\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product and easy install.

There has been and still is a learning curve. Not a lot of instructions with it. Never have learned how to turn it off Or on for that matter. I just start pushing buttons and it comes on. I then just leave it on when I'm done and at some point it goes off. I did find that the voice search apparently only works with Amazon movies. If it works with anything else I've yet to find out how. I've been hesitating to get Amazon Prime but found out with it I not only get the special shipping, I also get lots of movies and tv shows with the Fire Tv.  Made it a no Brainerd to get Prime. Now with Net Flix, Amazon Prime and Utube I can cut the cable and satellite cords. I have found that with the Fire Tv I can down load apps to do lots of other things. I'm still learning about some awesome things. One thing is I can watch Utube on the TV and control it with my phone. I believe their is an app to let me mirror my phone to the tv. I'm going to try and see. All in all I HIGHLY recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lawerance Southerland"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got it to me in 2 days.Hooked up to TV.
