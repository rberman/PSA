This led us to \"cut the cable\" and we bought two Roku Sticks for the bedrooms. Again, Loved.  We did miss live sports, so when Amazon had the Sling offer, we jumped on it.  A free Fire Stick! Just pay $60.00 for 3 months of Sling. OK.  This stick is nowhere near the quality of the Roku.  It freezes, buffers, stops working and re-connects to wifi about 30 times a day if not more, and that is when we can get it to work at all!  It also likes to say that the wifi signal is poor or that it is not connected at all.  It sits about two feet from our brand new router connected with the highest internet speeds available from Time Warner Cable.  I cannot recommend this product.  It is just too poor of a quality.  Just wish that I would have bought the Fire Stick on it's own.  At least then I could have returned it for a refund.  Instead, I took a \"deal\" and ended up costing me more that the retail value of the Fire Stick and am unable to recoup any of my money at all.

It's great because he doesn't have a game system to use as a platform. The Chromecast wasn't an option because he doesn't have a smart phone, and isn't that technologically inclined to use my laptop. It's very similar to a menu like OnDemand, which is simple to follow. We haven't had any trouble with the connection.
