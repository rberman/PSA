[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "After having to use a Blu-ray player with apps I was surprised at the differences. The speed to connect is dramatic compared to the player. Actually, the connection is instantaneous. No waiting. The menu is good and the search function seems to work well. I especially like the fast-forward function so you can see the progress in the video. And best, the image quality is excellent. HD quality is striking. After one month I have found no shortcomings. The remote is heavy but solid.Very pleased.The only drawback is the price as there are competitors for less. I have not tried those.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Outdoor Lover"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Wish the search feature looked at more services.

It is easy to use and setup.  Quality is top notch and app selection is great!  My three star review has nothing to do with the hardware or the software of the Fire TV it is without a doubt the best streaming product on the market.My three-star review is because of Amazon's ridiculous Prime Policy.  My wife and I share a Prime Account.  It works out great.  We both get amazing deals on shipping.  Where it falls flat is in streaming.  We can't share streaming?????  I can't stream Amazon Prime Instant Video because I am not the \"official\" prime member.  Uh... What... That is right only the primary account (the one that pays) can utilize Amazon Prime Instant Video.  The other account would have to either pay the $99 for it's own Prime account or it would have to pay per video it wanted to watch.  Why on earth would I pay $99 just for streaming video?  I already get the shipping benefits so $99 for a streaming plan is a bit over-the-top.This can cause many other unforeseen problems.  I bought the Kindle Fire TV (it's automatically registered to your amazon account).  I hooked it up and bought some apps.  I tried to stream Prime Instant Video.... wait I have to pay.  Ok, check Amazon's policy on Prime accounts and deregister the Fire TV then register it to my wife's account.  Hooray!  I can now stream Prime Instant Video for free!  My apps that I purchased are gone.  :(  I had to buy them over again to use on the Fire TV because technically my Wife is another account.  I didn't contact Amazon, because this is ridiculous, though I am sure they would have refunded my money for the apps that I can't really use.Give us a way out of this problem Amazon.  Let us share Amazon Prime Instant Video streaming like we do for Amazon Prime shipping.  I AM NEVER GOING TO PAY MORE FOR STREAMING THAN I ALREADY DO RIGHT NOW.  NEVER.You have a glorious device here with the FireTV.  I'll gladly give it 5 stars once you amend this crazy policy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Joe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My Fire TV runs beautifully.

In addition to Netflix it also lets me get a whole bunch of free movies and TV shows from Amazon Prime for free. I especially like the voice search feature. You can speak into the remote and it will search for movies and shows based upon title or actor, or type of show (action adventure, mystery, etc.)I would buy it again. I have Apple TV for one television and it works well, and of course I can mirror my laptop with the full sized TV through the Apple TV. I don't think the Amazon Fire TV has that option.
