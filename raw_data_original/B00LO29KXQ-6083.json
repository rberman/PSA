My impression was that after I plug the stick to my SmartTV things will start working...instead I had to wait to download/install an update. Really.... :-( i guess that's the difference with Apple/Google products and rest...Apple/Google products just work with no hasslesAlso the download on first attempt did not work and it timed out. I had to try it again on the next day.I am sorry to say but I will not be using this product...I have too many choices to waste my time and effort to make this thing work..Sorry.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/6", "author": "RAY"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Debbie Herrarte"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I pre ordered it when it was $20.
