Up to this point I had been using an Xbox 360 to stream content from Netflix, Youtube, etc. That worked fine, but it's kind of annoying lugging around the rather large console just for one simple purpose. So I did some research and realized that since I already had an iPhone and a Macbook, Apple TV should be a no brainer. I love how it syncs perfectly with my devices and allowed me to link up with my iTunes account.

For example, if my husband and I want to watch Game of Thrones, I have to change the settings on my phone, then go back to re-enter the stricter setting after viewing so that the children don't have free access to it. Just would get a lot more utility if we could enter a code when trying to access each individual show....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jenski"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Johnny Varela"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great...
