With Hulu plus, it is the perfect amount of television and I get all the shows that I watch when I had cable.  If you get bored, then you're probably spending too much of your time watching tv.  I cut the cord to Comcast and never regretted it, thank you Amazon for saving me money on my monthly bill!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael Yim"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I LIKE IT! And, I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR.I would have given it 5 stars. The reason for the missing star is the face of the remote is all black and very hard, for me, to discern the functions in the dark resulting in having to restart rented programs after each pause or rewind etc. Perhaps the buttons could have some kind of surface features or a contrasting color for the function buttons. Otherwise, as it looks it is cool. Form before functionality?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bajarocky"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It doesn't work, I have tried everything.
