It does everything it says it does and makes streaming audio/video from my family's iPhones and iPad a breeze. The user-friendliness couldn't be any better. The primary uses of my Apple TV include streaming Youtube videos, Easy Access to radio stations and my iTunes library. Works great for Netflix which I use the most.There is so much more you can do with this fantastic little box than the apps that come preloaded. Download the free remote app and you can loose the remote that comes with the device. \"Mirroring\" your Apple devices is also a breeze. Fantastic product.
