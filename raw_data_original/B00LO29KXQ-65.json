[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "It seems to run well on our TV and internet. I like the remote and the fact that the unit of the firestick itself is small. It would be better if it charged while it was plugged into the TV rather than having to have an external charging source. However, it overall is very well made and put together.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

I even purchased a longer hdmi cable to get it away from the tv.  I would buy a Roku next time.  My Roku player always works.  Netflix works fine on Rku, but my Amazon prime freezes no matter what device I use.  I use Amazon prime primarily for the shipping not the video or music.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't get maxgo and crunchy roll just to name a couple of sites. This may come to amazon down the line, just don't know when and if it is already accessible then please someone let me know how to downloaded so I may watch it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eddie Gold)(:':('"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jean Ramos"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great item", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James porter"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Whitley Williams"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It's ok I wish it had more channels", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "trey"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I don't understand it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kimberly Davis"}]
