I just wanted to project PowerPoint and some anatomy apps off of my fire HDX.First I tried connecting normally and it just wouldn't work.On my second call to customer service I was told about the hidden function of tapping seven times to 'disable hdcp'. This allowed me to mirror my display...sometimes.I read on a few forums that this device is the least functional available for miracast support. They really shouldn't be allowed to advertise it as a 'function'. When I manage to connect it disconnects randomly and the image is always lagging by a large amount. Audio support is horrible. And of course, Amazon makes no wired adapters to connect a third generation device to a display. So now I have a useless 7\"HDX, less than a year old, and a useless fire tv stick. Save up and just get Apple.
