Its more about the content - Amazon Prime has taken a sad road and I feel I am left behind and discarded as a Father in a family who cherishes traditional family values.  Features to control content on the Amazon Fire Stick are lame.  The system requires you to set a pin and openly enter the pin for each parental consideration.Asian TV and Movies are displaying superior morals.  Why isnt this available?  BYUTV provides clean content, intellectually stimulating entertainment such as Granite Flats series.  Gortimer is ok, but not in the same league as BYUTV's Granite Flats.Secondly regardless of parental settings all content is shown.  There is no simple way to use the long standing well established ratings of movies or TV content.For example you cant just say - no \u201cR\u201d rated material, or no \u201cPG-13\u201d material.  Numerous tantalizing and nearly obscene images are displayed as \u201ccover art\u201d for the thumbnails regardless of the settings.Numerous homosexual and transvestite materials are listed in the menus showing females kissing females, or men dressed in female clothing, as well as other intimate acts barely hidden but fully suggested.Almost all of Amazon\u2019s own published series seem to creative capacity to do anything but show scenes of intimacy, apparently following HBO\u2019s perspective that the only way to tell a story about history is to show erotic details that have little to do with history.Why cant we have intellectually stimulating programming without the emphasis of humanity\u2019s inhumanity.I am paying Amazon, I hope they understand the reason why I choose to pay for programming - it isnt so I can dine on more immoral slop.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install and easy to use.
