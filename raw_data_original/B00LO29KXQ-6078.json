[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I do like the interface, however there seems to be some kind of buffering glitch, no matter what i am doing like watching Amazon Prime or HULU Plus or NETFLIX or listening to Pandora,  am experiencing constant hiccups. My ROKU XS does not do any of that. I like the variety and amount of gaming options there are, but there is no option to play offline. A little bit bigger remote with a QWERTY pad on the back would be greatly appreciated and keep all on screen text option in QWERTY fashion, which they are not. Overall, it's a little less than what i expected, just due to the buffering hiccup i am experiencing. Maybe an update will correct that in the future.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Tunny Bones"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Whoa, blows chromecast out of the water. fast interface, good wifi and a REMOTEWay to go amazon.Like it as much as my roku,and a 1/3 of the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian Adler"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic quality!!
