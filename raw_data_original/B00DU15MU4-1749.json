Easy to use too - I really appreciate the voice activated search. I hesitate to say I love it because I would never say that about TV in general... but Fire TV comes close.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "tc"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "sound is intermittent, the beeps and blipps for voice search work and can get holmes on homes,the writers room however anything else plays the movie but no sound very disapointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "tom"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This was the best thing I've ever returned.  I've been using a dedicated computer to watch online content on my TV.  My audio receiver does not process audio over HDMI.  I needed a device with a digital audio output.  The full size Fire has a digital optical.  It plays Amazon Prime content wonderfully!  Video begins streaming immediately.  Using the Fire, you can fast forward (at 3 speeds) and jump forward or back by 10 seconds.  Nice to have DVR functions!Cons:I hoped to watch other content using the Fire.  It says it plays Showtime anytime, but only if you have one of the few providers they allow.  I hoped I'd be able to watch fox.com abc.com nbc.com and cbs.com.  I knew I'd need to add an app to have a browser.  I found tutorials online, and it was easy enough to do.  Unfortunately the browser is detected as a handheld browser.  ABC.com wanted me to install the ABCGO app, and wouldn't play shows.  If I had more HDMI inputs on my receiver, I'd keep the fire.  If I didn't need the digital optical output, I'd buy one of the cheaper units.The Fire goes back.  I guess I'll get a better computer to run as my stand alone computer.  The current one barely handles streaming HD video content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "D.
