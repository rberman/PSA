[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome.  I have been a roku user for 10 plus years and have always been a fan.  My most recent TV purchase was a 65 inch Samsung  smart TV but I found that I did not at all like the Samsung interface after being used to a roku.  Samsung was also limited in application options.  Clicked this baby in with a powered USB attachment (purchased separately) and now never use the Samsung smart TV option.  I just click over my source to this on HDMI and use the roku remote to control the TV.  Love this purchase.  Going to order one for my mom who has a smart Panasonic TV with an even worse user interface.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karen Colomb - Do Not Open"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It is ok but seems to have trouble pulling up Netflix alot.

It was simple to set up for starters.  The main reason for the purchase was to have easy access to Feeln site (Hallmark movies).  I ran an old Hallmark movie to see if there were any issues.  The movie played completely through with no interruptions.  It is slower moving from site to site as compared to my Roku3.  But, once I had the site locked in, we were good to go.  Never having owned \"The Stick'' before, I only ordered one as a test.  In the meantime, the price returned to the old price of eight dollars higher.  I read a ton of the reviews, prior to ordering.  Other than being slower than the Roku3, this will be a keeper.  I also plan ordering a second one......just have to wait for another sale.  I made my electrical tie end through my surge protector versus going to the TV direct.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jim S."}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Really really slow.
