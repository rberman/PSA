This is amazing and by far is so much better than Roku could even dream of being.  The remote works really well even with the stick behind the TV. The Android phone app is awesome!  You can control the stick from this App with great ease.  Movies and shows load super fast and playback is crisp and clear without any interruptions.  You can pause easily, fast forward, rewind, all with easy and it is super smooth.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles Z.
