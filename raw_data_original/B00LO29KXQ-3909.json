[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "The only reason I got this was because Sling was not supported on my PS4 and this came for free when you signed up for Sling.With that said, it's good for what it is. I use it for Netflix and Amazon prime and it works just fine.  The only reason I give it 3 stars is because there's not to many apps you can download for it.  The main one I wanted was the Comcast app so I could watch the walking dead. I tried getting around this by mirroring my IPad(which has the Comcast app) to the Firestick (You need to buy an app on the Firestick for $6.99, which I did) and it won't let me, I get some copyright BS when I try to do it. Amazon was nice enough to refund me for the now worthless app.Overall if you are interested in Sling (where you get to watch about 10-15 TV channels for $20 a month) and they still have the offer where you get this device for free, it's worth it.If you are just buying this as a standalone device inorder to upgrade your TV to a smart TV, I would go with the google Chrome.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Devon"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Bosch series was excellent, but recent movies cost money to view...not good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bill Burton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ruth Ventrello \"tech nut\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Does not work with my Sharp HD TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "HARRY A.

I get the infamous blue screen message on any of these sources with audio but no picture. This problem is not unique to me based on other reviews so I have taken a leap of faith in that adding an HDMI splitter to the equation will effectively strip out the HDCP mismatch and get me working. I did try all other simple recommendations (Firestick firmware / software update, swap HDMI port, full power resets, etc. to no avail).  The HDMI splitter will add $23 to the cost of this solution which depresses the value somewhat. Note that Sling TV, YouTube, and Pandora work fine.I will update this review and potentially star rating after I get the splitter in place and ascertain whether it works or if I will be returning it. Given the frequency of this issue I think Amazon could do a better job is either establishing / publishing device compatibility requirements or ensuring their device was less narrow on what it deemed HDCP compliant. So far this seems to be a much rockier start then I would expected for a media 'appliance'.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "The Gooch"}]
