This is definitely a stretch. I think is the other way around. Let see the pros and cons:Pros:- Fire stick is cheaper- You don\u2019t have to register it. It comes pre-registered to your Amazon account. You have also the option of changing the account as and when you wish to do so.Cons:- Fire user interface sucks. It is not necessarily counterintuitive but is not comfortable either. Roku has a better and customizable user interface.- Amazon claims higher speed for Fire and no buffering. This is false claim. So far it has taken Fire more time than Roku to start the same show on the same network.- Amazon fire stick lost network connection at least 4 times in a day. This never happened to Roku stick on the same room, on the same TV.- Any app has to be downloaded and manually installed on Fire. They are preinstalled on Roku stick. You just have to activate it/added to the favorites.- CC is either too small (1\u201d tall on a 55\u201d TV ) or huge on some channels. There is no way to adjust it. Roku offers the user the option of easily customizing the CC size.I had seriously considered yesterday returning the stick to Amazon. It does not worth the hassle. Most likely the stick will end up somewhere in a box with other obsolete electronics. I will stop by Best Buy today to buy a second Roku stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "L.M.H."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy setup, smooth video.
