It sucks if you want to us Netflix or Hulu. It constantly \"cannot connect to Netflix\". But I can get Netflix to work fine on my Kindle. So it's not my network that has the problem. Crackle works fine. I think Amazon doesn't want you to use Netflix so it makes it crash. Very disappointing Amazon. Makes me not want to pay for their service. Btw, Netflix works fine on my blueray player in the other room but crashes on the Firestick.

This interface is harder to navigate. It is a giant Amazon advertising sea. Look, recommended Amazon shows. Look another row of Amazon shows. Look, another row. The channels are there somewhere.The remote is easy to use, after i managed to open it for the batteries. Make the notch deeper instead of smooth. I have the non-voice model.The channels, aka apps, take forever to download. Set up has taken around an hour after waiting for each app to download and activate. Set up on the roku was half that. I didn't even bother hunting for all of the ones I wanted. I was tired of staring at the Amazon advertised shows in the que.Sling which was a buy a three month subscription, get this stick free promotion isn't worth the cost even with the free stick thrown in. 59.99-39.99 means I paid for one month get two free.Allow me to set up my own choices, get rid of the endless Amazon program icons that are advertising I didn't pay to navigate around. One row, fine. Several rows, every time I turn it on, I am not happy. Yes, it is an Amazon product, and stupid me, I should have remembered Amazon likes to push their products harder than drug dealers want to hook people on drugs. It's overkill. I will never purchase another Amazon created product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Angela C."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Fire TV Stick.
