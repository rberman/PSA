Not sure since I dumped my Comcast Cable but I think they are throttling the streaming... That is annoying. Paying the jerks $66.95 a month. With an HDTV antenna, and Pluto TV getting plenty of Channels! Also using Oooma which gives me free landline over internet. So I am paying $86.95 for internet, TV and phone!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Joseph A. Davis"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great device.

With all the shows available on Prime and Hulu, we never watch television. Pandora and iHeart Radio, out home is always filled with music. The screensaver plays photos from our Amazon Cloud and acts like a giant picture frame when it is mot in active use. The little games are very fun. The game controller is on my Christmas list.
