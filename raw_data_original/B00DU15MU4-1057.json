We have had it for several months and it is wonderful. We have a Samsung Smart TV and bought this for a smaller bedroom TV after deciding to cut from cable TV.  I wish I would have bought this first.  I would have purchased a less expensive TV and this to go with it.  It does everything the smart TV does and more!  I am not tech savy and this was so easy to install that I couldn't believe it.  Just plug it in to your TV and it works!  The voice recognition is great!  My young daughter uses it with no problems ever! I cannot recommend it more highly.  If you are thinking about buying it, just do it!  You won't regreat it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Liz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE this, it is saving me alot of money and we can watch movies anytime we want.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ellen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great device.
