From box to watching Netflix was less than 10 minutes, and part of that time was maneuvering to get to the back of the TV to plug the stick in. Very simple to switch from regular TV to Netflix, YouTube, etc.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kathy Cooke"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Much better than Google Chrome Stick - easier to set up and use and streams to the TV directly", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeffrey R Cohen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I want a little skeptical about getting a steaming device because I've always used traditional cable or watched shows on my Kindle or iPhone. After doing my research and comparing the Fire Stick to Chromecast and Apple TV, I decided that the Fire Stick would be the best bang for my buck. After I bought it, I went home to set it up. Set up couldn't have been easier. Even someone that isn't very tech savvy would be able to hook this up with no problems. After entering my Prime information, I was able to watch my Amazon content in about 5 minutes (if that long). The only con that I've run across is I can't seem to change when the Fire Stick goes into sleep mode, other than that, everything else is wonderful. I've recommended it to anyone that's looking for a streaming device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lady Winchester"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Something seriously wrong with these units, not enough memory or processor or something.
