There are a bevy of features and video sources available to the user.  I doubted they would at first but they have corrected the initial problems that made this product unusable, it is a remarkable turnaround only through software updates; their programmers must have been given some kind of bonus to produce results as it indeed worked.  I have never seen a turnaround so fast before.  For me however due to Apple's ecosystem and my adoption of it, the Apple TV is the better fit for myself personally.  I would recommend the Fire TV over the Roku now without question.

So fast. I just don't get how they do it.Cons:\u2022 From the second you plug it in, you are reminded amazon doesn't do good user interfaces. Force you to watch an intro video with no skip.\u2022 The user interface for content navigation is not good. Within a category they only provide you a few items to scroll through at time which makes browsing lists of TV shows and movies tedious.I prefer the technology on this device to my Apple TV so we end up using this more often as a family. Especially good for kids who aren't proficient spellers to be able to speak into the remote to find their favorite shows. But the UI really is so bad that I end up browsing for more content in netflix on my Apple TV, building lists and discovering content and then maybe coming back and just playing it on the fire.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alastair Halliday"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Christopher Tower"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Need more games", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/16", "author": "jerry outlaw"}]
