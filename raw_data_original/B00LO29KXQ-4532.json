[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "So I've finally put my Fire TV Stick into action.It's great if you only use Prime or Netflix however I must state that the rest of the channels aka \"apps\" are lacking compared to other mainstream devices.. (ROKU.. I'm talking about ROKU)..For example their spotify integration requires that I actually control the \"fire stick\" from my phone or other device on the network instead of just connecting to my spotify directly.  The Showtime app doesn't have comcast for a provider.. I mean really who doesn't have \"xfinity\" these days.There are no \"news\" apps that I could find to run in the background.. (Not that Roku does this very well but they do have some).So overall I have to give this a 3 start attempt by Amazon to break into the streaming device market.  Nice start but needs updates and more options.  I am happy that I'll be able to use netflix and prime instant video on it though so I went into this with the attitude that I'd give it a try and at least use it for those 2 mainstream streaming services, I was just hoping for more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ramius"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works like a magic.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "monthira mountry"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it!

Only I con sometines on certain channels the wife seizes of stops for short times causing picture/sound or both to temporarally freeze.  Amount of channels is trensndous. Setup is a snap 60 seconds. Get the Voice remote it also works fantastic and sets up in a snap. Reward yourself for $40.00 you will get almost all the channels you could want for free. Espically for PRIME members.
