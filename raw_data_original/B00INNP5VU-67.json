[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "While roku has the best assortment of apps, it's image quality is worse than a Fire TV stick, as it tends to crush blacks and just generally make everything too dark both in Amazon and HBO streaming channels.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Johnny"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Not as fast as our Roku 3 (both on wifi & both refurbished), but barely a noticeable difference.. The stick itself plugs into your HDMIport. It comes with a USB cable to power it. If your TV doesn't have an USB port it also comes with an adapter so it can be powered by a standard power outlet. We got this for our kids room and my 6 year old operates it with no problems. Considering it does all the same core operations as our Roku 3 at a much lower price point you can't beat it. The 3 does have games and motion controls, but I've yet to see anything to make that a selling point. I love our Roku 3, but I'd be just as happy with 2 of these instead of our 3 and a streaming stick if I had to do it all over again. I think this is an excellent purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Hickzilla"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The functionality is great, but it seems to be a bit slow at times.

The Stick is now out of warranty so we have no choice but to throw it away.

I have chromecast and Fire sticks and an older \"smart\" TV which isn't all that smart. The Roku stick was easy to set up but the reception wasn't great; very slow and lots of buffering. Initially, I was disappointed.I saw that an HDMI extender was available at no charge so I ordered it. I figured it wasn't much different from the one on my Chromecast which was now on another TV set and not used very often. I pulled it off the Chromecast stick and put it on the Roku stick. Problems fixed.When the extender arrived from Roku, I switched them. For me, the extender made all the difference - so why didn't Roku just stick one in the box to begin with? Chromecast did.I like the Roku remote and all the channels available; the Fire stick remote works better for Amazon Prime. Glad I bought all three. I would give it five stars if they had just put the HDMI extender in the box in the first place.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "editortr \"TomR\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own a Chromecast, ROKU, and a fire...ROKU hands down is the best.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael Harris"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect is every way.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Albert L.
