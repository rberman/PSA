It does what expected but just a couple of things.1. The remote is useless if you do not have direct access to the stick.  The phone app works awesome.2. Use the power outlet like the directions state.3. If you have multiple Wi-Fi users, make sure you have plenty of speed or things will get choppy.Because  of this product, I have lowered our ATT TV bill $90.00 a month.
