What features are available outside the USA? There seems to be no information page dedicated for this. I have noticed Amazon products being sold in Australia (tablets,phones,etc) but the sellers are not aware of the details and importantly what is not applicable to non-USA. Amazon started a revolutionary idea in the original kindle in being able to access content from anywhere but the full tablets seem to be presenting difficulties with this concept and there is no official position (that I can see). It would be great to buy a product like this and access free and paid content from a different part of the world - isn't that what the whole idea was about?", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Shakeel Aziz"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I thought I was buying something I wouldn't have to pay for something else.At no point does it say you only get Amazon free........so anything else you want you pay for.

But it needs an \"off\" button on the remote, the light remains on after I turn my tv off. It is supposed to go into sleep mode on its own but it does not always do so. Just a minor annoyance which I resolve by placing the device in \"sleep\" mode manually through the \"systems menu\".  Still a great product.
