There's no way to log onto the internet through a hotel's network if there is a password required for the network.  So it connects to the wifi without problem, but immediately reports, \"connected with problems.\"  There's no way to enter the hotel's network password... so you're dead in the water.The whole premise of the Fire stick is that you can take it on the road.  Does anybody at Amazon ever travel?  Hotel networks almost always require a password.  This is a great idea, poorly executed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.

I bought it so my 2 year old can watch Netflix in the room when my living room tv is being occupied. well I couldn't figure out how to get any of the apps to work.. it took forever to except my wifi password. I didn't know that the fire stick had to be plugged in at all times to a charger.  all the apps  that you would like that it comes with have to be downloaded first before using it. the remote is hard to see when its dark as the buttons do not light up. other than all that I love the concept of it and I do like that I can take it anywhere like if I am traveling and what not. I only have Netflix downloaded onto it because it took forever to download it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Samantha christian"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I found this very difficult to use and it practically has to be on top of my modem to work even though it tells me there is a strong signal in other rooms.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Laura M."}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "If I had the Stick first then I would probably write a much better review.  Unfortunately this box is underpowered compared to the regular fire tv.  If you need something for bottom dollar then this works as advertised.  If you can justify the extra money, just buy the fire tv.  It is much faster with the voice search.  I also noticed that it will freeze more often than the regular fire tv.  I will probably be replacing soon", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shawn M"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steve Scott"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "So far, I have not been able to get this to work at all.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jsomer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great. Bought it to supplement tv shows after cutting cable.  Only reason for the 4 star is that the stick needs to have a USB power cord plugged into the side of it to work.  This is not mentioned in any advertising or packaging anywhere that I could see prior to purchase.  It makes the whole \"convenience of switching it to other TVs\" not very convenient.  Some of my other TVs do not have open outlets or they are too far for the plug to reach.  I really didn't want to have to add power strips to everything just to allow Fire Stick use, as it was advertised as \"Easy to switch to other TVs\".", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeff Taplick"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love the idea of this gadget. And it works well. If you live in the country as we do you have to have a really good and fast internet service. And you have to pay attention to your internet limitations.  We actually bought this to see if it could replace the satellite tv service we have. (The stations we prefer you have to pay the higher price).
