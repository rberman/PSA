[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "This thing is truly terrible. I have had it for 6 months now and I reget not upgrading to a new Roku box. It has a piss poor wifi radio and I constantly have to reboot. Buffering constantly! Concept was good and hardware looks nice, but definitely under performs.

Had I known that I would have bought a roku instead.  Or at least something not so locked down.  It's all Android so amazon will use Google open source os but not allow paid services on it.

I have come to love it as well. Very easy to use. No issues using it with the remote. I use it with my Samsung 46 inch TV and it works perfectly. I can play my Amazon music that I purchased through the app that is installed on the stick and have mini concerts in my room. I can watch all the Amazon Prime videos and the instant ones.
