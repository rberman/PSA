The only problem I have had so far is when using YouTube. It will keep freezing and loading. I don't know if that is an internet issue, or if it's because we have three other devices that use WiFi in our home (Though we have a very strong wireless router) or if it's a YouTube problem, or what. Our Netflix has no loading issues though. But we like the Fire Stick so far.....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susan M.
