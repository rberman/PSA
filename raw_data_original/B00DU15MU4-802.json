[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this device. It is fabulous to be able to stream any show or movie that would be available online right to the TV. It was VERY easy to set up, too. The only small caveat is that you absolutely have to have the remote to work the Fire TV -- there aren't any controls on the box itself. That aside, it's easy to use. A very good buy, highly recommended -- especially if you're an Amazon Prime member.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrea F.

It allows me to connect to all my favorite channels and allows me to easily navigate using the built in Voice Search feature.I have to rate this 5 stars because 10 is not an option! Keep up the good work Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sir Adam G.

Every couple days, the audio quality would become degraded and the video would start skipping frames.  A power cycle would fix the issue for another day or two, but it would always return.  Amazon customer service sent me a replacement unit but it had the same problem.  Ultimately, I returned the Fire TV for a refund.I've been a Roku user for years.  I currently have 4 of them in my home.  I have never had any problems with them.  I was really excited to get the Amazon Fire TV because of its impressive technical specs and positive user reviews.  My experience with it was not good.  I now have a 5th Roku on order to replace the failed Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jennifer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This box has performed better than I anticipated.
