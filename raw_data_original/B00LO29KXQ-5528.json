Amazon registered my device to someone named Milton.  After 2 hours of being transferred around and a bad Amazon rep. not even documenting our conversation, and a supposed manager calling me back and immediately hanging up after saying hello... I finally was able to call again and get transferred to better reps.  They are sending me a new stick.  Only wasted over two hours ona Saturday night to get them to replace their screw up.  Duplicate serial numbers... how very stupid is that.  And horrible customer service on top of it.  unusual for Amazon, but it happened and I'm not happy.Now I see the replacement stick being sent is refurbished!  Can this get any worse???Had to file a BBB bait and switch complaint.  :-(", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Barb"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I ordered this when the prime event was taking place. This thing is awesome and just what I needed. There was no need for me to play games on it, so I use it for videos only. The best part is that I can also access my purchased videos and TV shows. This is a big plus for me. I also watched a nice two hour movie in 1080p and this thing consumed about 10GB of bandwidth. That works out to about 10mbps internet connection required if I calculated properly. Internet speed was not really a problem for me, but it might for others.My Setup: Unifi AP-LR 300mbps, 85mbps internet connection, Polaroid 1080p TVI posted a picture of the bandwidth consumption and the device next to a tape measure for those who are space limited.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "9/9", "author": "Derek Frohock \"Derek6711\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.  Works great. Makes watching Prime Instant Video, Netflix and Hulu  Plus as simple as can be.  I ordered it a month or so ago with estimated delivery of Jan. 5.  It was delivered Dec 12.
