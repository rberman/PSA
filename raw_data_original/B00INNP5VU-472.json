I have an old Sony SMP-N100 & do still enjoy it best.  Didn't require personal info to register the Sony device & still prefer their display method.  The RokuRoku 3500R Streaming Stick (HDMI)\u00a0was purchased to receive a tv broadcast channel available free only through Roku. This stick is the best way to go in my opinion from among the Roku items available. Was cheaper, simple to set up & since I have limited plugins at this point I exchange my lap top's space for it. You never really shut off anything Roku unless you unplug it. I fixed that problem by plugging it into a switch device (some sold here on amazon such as GE or Leviton plug in switches) so I turn it off with the plug in switch.  Again, not needed with Sony. I noticed some seem to think it takes too long to come back to life when shut off completely, but doesn't seem that way to me. Over all good product, less expensive & simple to use.  Too bad Roku wants credit card info even when you won't be using it. I'm continuing to used my Amazon & Netflix video accounts through Sony who doesn't ask me for my credit card info.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Irish Lass"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Looks and works like new.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "roy dewalt"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product!, Great Shipped!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Francisco Gamez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Delivered fast and worked perfectly.
