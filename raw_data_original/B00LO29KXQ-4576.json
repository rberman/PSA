I haven't been able to use it even once. I have the fire TV box at home and love it. When the fire stick came out I didn't hesitate to purchase. I travel for work so I'm gone more than I'm home and was thrilled to have a portable option that doesn't take up valuable packing space. So disappointed that it won't connect to public wi-fi that requires a log in. Amazon has put a one line blurb on the fire stick page saying they are working on it, but its been there for a while. If your looking for something to travel with, the fire TV stick is not it. I'm hoping its just a software update.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "PentwaterGma"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Stopped working, no way to fix it.

We are an Amazon family entirely and this definitely would be worth the full price. The remote is small and intuitive to work with, reminiscent of the initial ipods.Connectivity on this was a breeze. Plugging it in to the TV, connecting to WIFI and finally linking it to the Amazon Prime account used for purchase. It is important to note that it comes already pre-set to the account you purchased it for. There is the ability to change this (as I discussed with my husband) but we chose to keep it.We stream Netflix often and downloaded the Disney Junior for our child. I'm still learning about the benefits of Prime on this, but I can tell you there is a TON of material available!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amanda"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I so love this device.

It's not dramatically better than its competitors, but it's not the worst. For $39, it's okay as a streaming-media option, and if you're into Amazon's ecosystem.Pros:1. Unobtrusive design2. Improved On-screen keyboard3. Dedicated Prime Video sectionCons:1. No HBO Go2. Remote lacks voice search button3.
