Love all the shows we can get, sooo many. Trial and error though. I turned off my cell and internet access on my ipad, seemed to work better. Not so many devices trying to use the same thing. Changed my cable setting with the cable company, my streaming is faster now. Seems to be evening times when the streaming slows. But the people who stream some of the shows don't stream the whole show. Or maybe it's just our misunderstanding of the stick. Hoping we can get rid of cable completely soon. Depends on this stick working well enough.

The Chromecast screen cast doesn't work at all from my android phone.  Also having to run the apps on the chromecast from the phone is impractical at worst and annoying at best.  The better way to use a chromecast is to not buy it and get a MHL adaptor for your MHL enabled phone.The firestick works as advertised.  Was configured for use, menus are intuitive, response time is much quicker that the ROKU.I haven't used the app, the kids do and it seems to work fine for them.  I also haven't tried to fling the screen or whatever, but even it that doesn't work at all it would be a tie with the chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard H.
