[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I have this because i got a great deal around the holidays when it first came out.  I don't care much for it but am keeping it in our spare bedroom for our guests to be able to watch tv since it was cheaper than other streaming sticks.  I have a Roku and Apple tv and love both of those and much prefer them.  I have amazon prime so that is another incentive to keep this since apple tv doesn't offer the amazon instant video app.  However if you are deciding on a streaming player and amazon instant video is a must, then go with the Roku, it's so user friendly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael B"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am an Amazon junkie, but I really love this product.  If you are just looking to watch Prime or Netflix, or stream your device, this is the perfect product.  I was fortunate to get mine for $19.99, but it is easily worth the regular full price.  Remote is sleek but has all the necessary buttons to easily navigate for your show.  IPhone App makes it even easier to type in information to locate your favorite show or actor/actress.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joshua"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "good investment only have satellite for TV and internet", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gary"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Can't get it to work and no one seems to be able to help....followed the directions to the letter....", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris Cecconi"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "We had no idea you actually have to pay for each show that comes up on screen individually  Even some of our free television on PBS you have to pay for.

There is a decent selection of shows and movies and am overall happy. I couldn't give this product 5 stars because there are two things that irk me a bit. First, I will be watching a show and all of a sudden it freezes and has to \"catch up\" (similar to streaming youtube videos). This doesn't happen all the time but every once in a while it happens over and over a few times during an episode of a tv show I'm trying to watch. Compared to having to watch live television, I do like how I can skip the commercials now. The other thing that irks me is that you have to plug in the fire stick to a wall outlet for power. Kind of a pain to have to plug it in somewhere. I'd think it would be able to use the power from the tv, but I guess not.  Overall, it's a good product. I'm trying this out to see how well I like it versus cable. If it continues to go well, I am planning on dropping cable altogether for this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Megan"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It was a toss up between this and the fire tv box up until the day I made the purchase. The deciding factor for me was obviously the price and honestly, I didn't need all the bells and whistles that the box offered. I wanted something easy-to-use for Netflix and of course, Amazon Prime, I hated having to get my son's PS3 every time I wanted to watch something. Well, I can't even watch anything on Prime, buffering constantly. Netflix is only slightly better. My router is top notch and new, my internet service is working properly and at high speed. I am returning and going to give the Fire TV box a try.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ladywriter"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great!  Just wish you guys could provide the internet too!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jimhayes66"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is way faster than my Roku HD. The UI and the remote itself are very responsive, though I liked the Roku's UI a little better. The included remote does not support voice search, but you can add voice search by buying the fancier remote or installing the Fire TV app on your smartphone or tablet.Usually we watch Amazon Prime on our projector via our smart Blu-Ray player, but when I'm watching something alone or for those rare occasions when we don't want to watch something on the projector, I'll sometimes turn on the TV instead. My favorite feature is that it automatically turns the TV on and switches it to the correct HDMI input through my Toshiba TV's \"Regza-Link\" feature. I assume it's a standard feature with different names on different brands of TVs, but none of our other HDMI devices have done that in the past.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "igen \"igen\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love the ease of use.
