It worked great for about two episodes on Netflix, then it decided to start loading really slow and would not play back anything on Netflix. I even rebooted my internet modum and unplugged the stick from the TV. Same results. I ended up sending this back.

Did not give it 5stars because compared to Apple TV it is lacking in some areas.  I find it very frequently lags freezes when streaming video or movies.  I have very fast internet speeds (over 70mps download) and still the videos lag.  Also the way it displays the content can often be less than user friendly.Enough of the negatives...For the price and simplicity, this device is great.  I love that you can add different apps based on your needs.  The iPhone remote controller app also works very well!In summary, I would recommend this product but still prefer Apple TV overall.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.
