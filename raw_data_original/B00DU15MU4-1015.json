The only problem we are dealing with at this time is trying to figure out why the Amazon TV will not go into sleep mode.  After contacting customer service, we are trying a few suggestions to correct the problem.  Hopefully within a few days our issues will be solved.

The remote has a great, precise feel to it and it has a super easy and snappy interface.  Most of the time you never even see a pre-buffer of video content, its just instant.

And while I won't say this is more than an incremental improvement, it is better.  Let me explain...In summary, I would have HD streaming issues (buffering) with Roku and the Netflix, Amazon and HBO servers.  The FireTV box immediately fixed this, and just to be sure FIOS didn't tweak my internet, I plugged the Roku 3 back in and watched an episode from each service... The FireTV kept HD quality the whole time and was just faster than Roku, period.  For this alone, when I can find what I want, this is a better box.Now, here is my 3 issues with it.1.) the interface is clunky, Roku is so streamlined and enjoyable compared to Amazon's.  Also, put the sleep button on the remote for ease of use2.) content - no FX app on Amazon, this hurts as I was watching the end of Sons of Anarchy (season 7) and just starting season 3 of the Americans... for this reason alone, I kept my Roku Stick3.) the remote application... I just am not in love with it (it is too sensitive)Finally, one thing many will like, the voice search is really accurate and finds things in other content providers you have hooked into (such as HBOGO).  So for this reason, I'll watch my main content on this device but with clunky interface and missing apps I can't give it a full five stars (but Roku 3 is no better for me).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "1-awm"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Donna Thompson"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Not enough information about the cost of movies", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "LM"}]
