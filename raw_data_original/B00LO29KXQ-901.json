[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is the best thing ever! I can use one device for all of the streaming options and use my phone or the remote! I was tired of hooking up my Mac to the TV to watch movies and stuff, and our bluray player streaming stopped working, so this was perfect for us.

This has replaced my Apple TV (besides for AirPlay display) for regular use. The Fire TV Stick is very responsive, full featured, and the apps make it a great gaming device as well.Pros: TONS of content, Instant access to the Prime videos and music library, and very responsive.Cons: Needs to be restarted every few days, sometimes freezes between TV episodes. BUT- Amazon helped and replaced my first Fire TV Stick very quickly after issues.I'd definitely recommend!

It's fine for about 30 minutes on Netflix, then it's the circle of doom at 25% loading and will not load any further. It's not the Wi-Fi router. When using the RGB cord and running off of the laptop, Netflix is absolutely fine. Sooooooo, not too sure about this little tool.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Madalyn Andeson"}]
