[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "So far I'm less than satisfied.  It was easy to set up but it's not easy to get a connection to wifi!  Said that it's connected \"with problem\"  No telling what the problem is...no little chart for troubleshooting.  I had the wifi speed and router checked, that's all working as expected.  I read that it might be a distance issue so I put the fire stick 2\" from the router...that did not help.  So, guess I'll have to stick to watching my one dvd/week.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The stick is a 5 Star product if:  (1) you are ok being limited by Amazon; and (2) you don't want to Miracast.  That is, if you just want an inexpensive stick to turn your TV or projector into a network capable, streaming wonder -- this is a pretty good item.  The major downside are the restrictions imposed by Amazon -- by design -- regarding the use external controllers is a huge downside. Amazon designed this thing so you can only use its controllers.  There is no extra USB port and attempts to use the existing one (by splitting it) to use a wireless keyboard have thus far been unsuccessful.  That's a major drag, because you will inevitably want to TYPE on this.  And you can't.  Unless you first sideload a settings app and then have or buy a bluetooth keyboard.  Fun!The major drag for other folks is that this damn thing can't easily be rooted.  So you are limited in terms of your control of the Android operating system.  For example, I would like to plug the Stick into an outdoor projector and cast the audio to an Airplay/DLNA capable receiver that powers the speakers.  But you can't do that.  You need root.I wouldn't buy it again.  I've spent far too much time trying to get this to work they way it should out of the box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MBWD"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to install and follow the prompts as indicated in the package.
