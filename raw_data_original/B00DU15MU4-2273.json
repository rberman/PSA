Not very impressed at this time. I still us my ROKU because of other channels not available on FireTV. Hopefully they can get caught up soon.

I absolutely love my Amazon Fire TV. I do not usually have much luck in setup or management of anything to do with the TV or remotes. I was a little nervous. I opened the instructions and to my surprise there were only three steps.  I was shocked when I just plugged it in and it worked! It was so simple! I think it took me more time to get it out of the box! I have Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu Plus. The menus and navigation are super simple and very user friendly. I am seriously considering getting rid of cable!! Highly recommend!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Spend2much"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazon Fire TV is AWESOME! it is so much faster than my old BLU RAY! otherwise it is what they say it is.
