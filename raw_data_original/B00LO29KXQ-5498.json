You do have to plug the fire stick part into an electrical outlet, which isn't a problem for me, but I did not realize that when I bought it and just thought I would share that with anyone looking into purchasing one.  The remote is great too, which I wasn't expecting to like so well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ddouth"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "works great in my spare bedroom when my grandkids come to visit", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dca \"dca\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Amazon does not disclose that this thing will not work off the HDMI port alone, but has to have a separate power supply plugged into a wall outlet.  All of the illustrations are of the unit simply being plugged into the TV.I like its function.  Bought it rather than a Roku simply because of the price.

A small USB device didn't seem like it could be fast and responsive. Plus my TV already had the amazon and netflix apps - so I figured why would I need another device?The stick itself is super easy to setup.  It automatically updates when you plug it in and shows an intro video to explain stuff.  It's extremely fast and responsive.  Selecting videos to play works surprisingly fast on wifi and has little to no lag.  The interface is light-years ahead of the included apps in my tv.  This allows you to search for movies, tv shows automatically play the next episode, and it has a screensaver turn on incase you fall asleep.I don't have many grips at all. It would be nice if Netflix was considered a \"native\" app, as in I didn't have to install it before using it.  But other than that I couldn't be happier.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Brant \"brant\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works as stated. We can now watch movies on our TV with the FireStick. Being a Prime Member we have a great selection of movies and music to choose from. Plus we can watch Netflix, Hulu and many more.
