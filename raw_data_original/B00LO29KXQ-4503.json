Great apps available for it. i had spotify connect added to this and can control spotify on my TV from my phone! great feature! all the features are great for this, easy to navigate menu's, small compact design, and most of all affordable! great product.

It was very easy to set up, easy to connect, and the remote is easy to use. I have a chrome cast and I am now going to get an Amazon fire tv stick instead. The chrome cast works well but can get disconnected which makes it harder to pause or stop the show you are watching. With the Amazon fire tv stick the remote control allows for quick access to change or pause your show without waiting for your phone to connect back to it like chrome cast. My parents love it and I want one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Meleah Hilton"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great! Wish there were more.
