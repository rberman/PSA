I cannot say enough good things about it. Took 2 minutes to install, takes up the space of a CD cover, works PERFECTLY and at last I have something in my house that listens to me!

The voice search option is very convenient and, as so many others have stated, it actually works! I may be easily entertained, but I'm amazed at how well it understands what I say. I really have no complaints with this device whatsoever, and am grateful for all the good reviews that convinced me to buy it. I'm not techno-savvy at all, and have to rely on the kindness and experience of better-informed strangers when it comes to purchases like this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Java Mama"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely awesome product. My heart started beating just a little bit faster as I plugged it in and whispered to myself \"Bye Bye Comcast; Here comes the future of TV\". So easy to set up. I take that back: I didn't have to set it up. Literally and figuratively plug and play. Voice search is an absolutely brilliant. Well done, Amazon! And hey, why didn't I dump Comcast sooner?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "X.

OMG!  My cable company isn't going to be happy when I seriously downgrade our \"rip-off\" movie channels that I am going to cancel.  Should have gotten this long ago.  Great free movies as an Amazon Prime member too.  My favorite thing is the voice command feature... I say \"Robert DeNiro\" and all his movies pop up onto the screen...
