[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "As others have pointed out, the font size is quite small. I have it plugged into an 18-inch TV in my bedroom, so sitting back in bed, I can barely read what's on the screen. However, the system is pretty easy to navigate, so once you get used to where the \"play\" buttons are on the menus, it's not that big of a pain to navigate. The only other downside of the Fire Stick, as a hockey fan, is NHL Gamecenter is not one of the apps provided. Other than that, I absolutely love the Fire TV Stick. It works great with my internet connection and rarely ever does a movie need to pause to buffer (at least no more often than the Sony Blu-Ray DVD player with wifi hooked up in my living room does).I'm docking a star for the small font and lack of Gamecenter (an app at least my Sony Blu-Ray player offers). If you already pay for Prime, I'd definitely recommend this. I've had mine for about two months and still love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alena"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Let me start off by saying how excited I was to buy this. I don't really like watching tv on my phone or laptop because I get distracted. I much prefer watching it on a big screen. The Firestick is something I've had my eye on for months and finally bought. I've only had it for 2 days, but both days I've encountered problems. It started off working fine but after a short while on both nights I went to use it, it stopped connecting to my wifi. My phone was still connected, so I knew that the Internet wasn't the problem. Tonight I restarted it a half dozen times and it did nothing. After an hour of wasting my time, I'm giving up.  I unplugged the stick from the back of my tv and noticed it was quite warm, so I don't know if it's an overheating problem or what. But overall, I'm extremely disappointed. I'm giving it two stars for now because I have seen it work for short periods of time and I haven't had it that long. However, if it continues with these problems, I'm going to have no choice but to return it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Paula"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was fired up about using this, but the USB unit doesn't utilize an ethernet connection for s streaming, which results in streaming interruptions.

Doesn't matter which app is used, there is lag multiple times during digital content playback.  I have many other electronics that play digital content and I have no problem with playback using any of them, the fire stick however is junk until they fix this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "carly"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I use this almost everyday love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.

If you do not use Amazon Prime, a different product would be better for you. The response time is pristine and Amazon content is easily accessible. But don't expect your iOS devices to interact well with the numerous apps which boast the ability to mirror your devices using AirPlay.Gaming:There is talk that Gamefly may start streaming game rentals to its customers and that they will use Amazon Fire exclusively. Obviously, you'll want to purchase the additional gaming controller, but even then, the games may only work with the \"puck\" and many games may not be compatible with the Fire TV Stick.TV Apps:If you subscribe to a cable television service, you need to make sure that your provider has a license to provide you with access to apps such as ESPN, Disney, HBO, Showtime, etc. Make a phone call for verification, because their websites may not reflect availability for the Amazon Fire. My provider, Charter, does not allow access to any of these services on the Amazon Fire even though I can access ESPN and Disney on my Apple TV. I think that Cox and SuddenLink offer access to all of them.Apple Users:Check out MacRumors to find out when the new Apple TV device is expected to be released and wait to buy that instead.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott Shirley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Does not freeze and restart like my Roku did.
