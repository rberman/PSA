[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "So dissapointed.  We are apple people.  Our family of 4 all have iPhones.  We own the 27\" iMac, iPads, iPods and MacBooks.  We've always loved apple but couldn't be more dissapointed with Apple TV.  It is not compatible with MOST apple products.  Unless your hardware is new, this is absolutely useless.  Not only that, but the unit itself constantly timed out.  The screen would freeze and turn black every few minutes and we have incredible internet speeds, so that shouldn't be an issue.  It was actually sitting directly next to our router.  It added nothing to our experience that a playstation couldn't do.  It was glitchy and a complete peice of junk.  My advice... Read the negative reviews of this product!  They are spot on.  We actually received a used product first and had to send it back, so we had waited far longer than we planned for a package we were more than dissapointed in.  Sent it back to Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/5", "author": "Roxysoxy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Nice!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James Arndt"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my apple tv", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "glenna raidt"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "BAD!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "36/49", "author": "J.
