I've had some issues with it randomly refusing to connect to the WiFi. Seems unreliable compared with Chromecast in this respect. It does have the advantage of working with Amazon streaming which is lacking in Chromecast.It's also difficult to enter secure WiFi passwords. i.e. long 64 character random ASCII entry with the remote is slow and frustrating. Unlike Chromecast where you just cut and paste it into the configuration app on your phone or tablet.Picture quality is fine.But if you can live without amazon streaming I would just get the cheaper Chromecast.However it does support TimeWarner Live TV streaming from your home network and Chromecast doesn't.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"super_haggis\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Often have trouble with the remote and reset the whole tv/internet/roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Caroline Perry"}]
