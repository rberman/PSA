[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Decent interface. Buffers often, sometimes glitching and stalling when watching netflix and even my own amazon library. My roku I have on another tv works fine. Don't know if this is software or hardware but get a firmware update amazon. Its ridiculous when your own device won't play your content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aldizar"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This works well for Amazon videos.

I put in the password NUMEROUS times(YES my password was correct) and it still would not connect. I called Amazon and they, of course, walked me through several things. Those things did not work. They then assured me they would call me the next day with a solution to my problem. I then receive an email from Amazon telling me to do the same things that I had just done so I call back and was AGAIN assured someone would call me the next day. Well, the next day rolls around AND I RECEIVED NO CALL FROM AMAZON. HOWEVER, just out of curiosity, I tried to connect and low and behold it finally connected. BUT I STILL RECEIVED NO CALL FROM AMAZON AS PROMISED. I don't care if they somehow knew I was connected or not LYING TO A CUSTOMER IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO HANDLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES! I finally got connected and it kept losing signal at first until I figured out I needed to move my router---I did that and FOR NOW it seems to work fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Terrie Coleman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this stick. It's got the most of the apps I use to watch TV and movies and the apps it doesn't have...I assume that has to do with the app developer/owner and not amazon.I like the UI and navigation.
