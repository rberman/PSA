Am able to access all Amazon Prime content. I connected to YouTube, Hulu, and Pandora as well as other content providers. The voice search for Amazon content works seamlessly. I wish that the voice search worked for other content such as YouTube. One evening I selected a movie from Amazon Prime using my Chromebook, yet when I voiced it into Fire an older version of that film came up. Using the Fire menu I went to Customer Service and selected that they \"Call me now\" on the screen. I immediately got a phone call and the technician helped me with my issue. I was amazed and pleased! I am very glad that I purchased Amazon Fire. I use it often.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jule' Ketcham"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Fast piece of hardware, but menu is confusing or takes time to get used to it, selection of movies on Amazon is confusing also - I suspect it has a lot to do with loosing so much space on the left with the men\u00e9e and having large icons on the screen . In particular year of release and actors are found immediately, need to adjust your eyes and search!The worse part to me is that there are not many apps of interest, even compared to Apple TV. Tokugawa is of course in another category for thisThey probably will have more apps as time goes, but for the time being I am disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Pascal"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "My son loves playing the games....a lot of the games work with the remote for the Amazon TV....some games require an additional gaming remote.

The selection of movies and TV shows available for free is minimal - even as a prime member.  Within moments we were back on HBO, seeing what was on.  I will add, the design and user interface is very sleek and nice, we just wish there was more content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Evans Longacre"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The FireTV is an outstanding product.  Everything works well from Amazon Prime movies to NetFlix movies.  Music channels like Pandora work as expected although Amazon has not integrated their on player into the FireTV yet.  This seems like a no brainer to me and should be done ASAP.  The few free games we have played have been high quality and the kids love them.I would like to see Amazon come out with a Prime+ service that grants you access to more of their digital content.  Right now I am paying for Prime and Netflix streaming.
