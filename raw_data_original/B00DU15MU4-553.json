Within minutes he was watching Amamzon Prime Video. I was impressed at the ease of setup also. The voice recognition is great!

I think video games and watching sports are colossal wastes of time, but I do enjoy movies, dramas, comedy\u2019s and sometimes special effects shows if well done. There are lots of no cost/ low cost offerings. I haven't signed up for Netflix yet as the prime offerings are plenty for the foreseeable future.  The Fire TV itself works as advertised. The picture quality is as high as it gets. The voice feature I initially though of as a useful gimmick, is actually very helpful in getting right to the title you want and it is fast. So often I purchase things based on hyped up marketing, only to be disappointed at the actual product. So far this one hasn't followed that mold.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.
