Mostly using it for Amazon Prime Music as the other apps/channels are available on my Roku3.  AcornTV is not available on the Fire TV so I will always be tied to the Roku for that alone.  The user interface for the Amazon Fire TV is a little BUSY!!!  I like navigating on the Roku3 much better.  I did a mini test of screen images by watching an Amazon Prime Video on both the Fire TV and the Roku3.  The picture was considerably better on the Fire TV.  The music sounds better as well.  Glad I requested this one for Mother's Day!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the unit and the ease of use.  Great picture.
