But then there is the fire stick. The fire stick is in a class of its own. It has better specs than the roku equivalent and it shows in the performance. The ui is better looking and snappier. The fire sick remote is way too easy to get use to and has more of a natural feel with just navigating with your thumb. I know the roku has more channels but honestly most of those channels are trash.My favorite feature is the fire stick remote app for my android g3. It is soo damn cool and fun to use. And I thought the physical remote was a joy to use. With the phone app it has voice recognition and works extremely well.I use my rokus and fire stick for sling player and sling tv since I cut cable. Both work comparable to each other but the fire stick is a better product in my opinion and its the same price. Both have the most popular channels but like I said, the extra channels on roku that you won't see on the fire stick suck anyway.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "cheetoresidue"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "By far the greatest device I've purchased.

I really love how it makes so many apps available on my TV screen. I am disappointed with the lack of selection of the movies I get through Prime, though. So without Hulu Plus and my Netflix accounts there wouldn't be many movies to watch. I was hoping the combination of the TV Stick and Prime would allow me to cancel the other two subscriptions.
