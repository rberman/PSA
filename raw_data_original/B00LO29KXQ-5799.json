[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I find the amazon fire tv stick very mobile and easy to use. Streaming is very smooth as long as your internet doesn't have issues. I love all the apps I can get on it, but I'm currently waiting for HBO Go to show up in an update.

I have a smart TV - the Fire Stick still needs to connect to your home Internet network. The stick works as an HDMI input so it does not interact with any other apps on your Smart TV.2. I am able to use the Fire Stick without the extender and have had no issues with streaming. The picture has been clear and uninterrupted.3. I am a Amazon Prime member and the Fire Stick came attached to my account. On setup you just verify your Amazon account name.4. Very easy to install and use. When I first installed, the stick took about 3 or 4 minutes to verify & update. After that you are prompted to watch an introductory video that may be helpful for the 'technology challenged'I also noticed when you leave the TV on the Fire Stick input for a while it goes to screen saver, which to me seemed pretty neat.I'm very happy I purchased this. Worth the wait!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian B"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is great. It's really smooth, has a great selection of apps and prime features. You can sync all your prime stuff. Music videos and pictures too.  The selection for apps is pretty good. There isn't alot of coop games for use with the fire stick remote in my opinion bit they did have hill climb racing which I'm addicted too lol.I got this on the 20 dollars sale pre order. Even still. its totally worth full price. I definitely recomend.What I like the most is that you can also have Netflix and plex.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Joe"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love the convenience of the Fire TV Stick, works great, arrived early...would definitely recommend. The reason for a 4 and not a 5 is I am already bored with it. As a member of Amazon Prime, I find that you have to pay for almost everything you want to view and it's pricey.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Melissa M."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jose Lozano"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This little device is a life saver when nothing is on TV.
