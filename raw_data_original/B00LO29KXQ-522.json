When I called customer service the customer rep suggested unplugging and replugging the stick, which I did. When that didn't work he said I needed to have my tv and stick 2 feet from the router to trouble shoot. (Wait I have to carry my tv down a flight of stairs to fix connectivity issues, when my high speed internet is working fine with my cellphone, kindle and laptop??) I asked if there was any other way to fix this he said that that was the only way to see...So I asked how I could return it if there's no other way and he was quick to give me the instructions rather than solve the issue. I'm disappointed mostly because I was excited for this device because I use Netflix, Amazon prime and Hulu plus. But, I'll just have to switch back to the roku", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "maireadg"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Regarding fire tv stick:It was great & flowless for the 1st few days then had few glitches.
