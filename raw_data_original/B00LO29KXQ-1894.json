Played with  it a bit more and decided to keep.  Should I return and order it again, or can it be recharged to my my account and save the wear and tear on the postal service?  A week later, Great Potential, but I constantly am told that my system does not have enough band width to support continuous streaming.  How much band width is required?  I have the top end of Hughes Satellite internet, an Asus router with 130Mbps link speed showing on my Kindle Fire HD.  Still, when I try to stream a movie it only buffers a few seconds at a time.  Any Suggestions?  New post: In regard to the status of the subject order, please review the sequence of events:1) 5/31 Ordered Amazon Fire TV Stick.2)  6/01 Fire Stick price posted to my account.  Fire Stick received.3) 6/02  Requested return of Fire Stick.4) 6/03  Refund was posted to my account.4) 6/03  Decided to keep Fire Stick.

Admittedly a little bit glitchy from time to time, but rarely, and easily sorted out with restarting it....and TOTALLY worth the minimal hassle as compared to dealing with customer service from most cable TV providers, plus you can get near infinitely more shows and movies compared to TV.
