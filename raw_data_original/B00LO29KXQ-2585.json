I had AT&T; u verse internet & TV bundle, $190/month.  I dropped that down to internet only for $45/month, got the Fire TV stick, and signed up for Netflix and Hulu+, $8.99/each. With the Prime membership I already have, my options are virtually endless. The buffering so far has been extremely limited, and only happens with Hulu, leading me to believe it's their problem, not the fire stick.
