My Internet isn't even the best but it worked awesome. Forget all the reviews that go on about roku, I have amazon prime and I was really shocked how good the stick was , the quality, even the packaging and ease of use. Felt like they ripped off apple look and feel and packaging but I felt like I opened and installed an apple product. Based on the reviews, I was thinking that because it's a stick the performance wouldn't  be as good as the regular streamer but I had no problems...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Porschguynyc"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We've only used it a couple of weeks, but so far, we are very pleased with our Fire TV Stick!

It has never crashed, which is more than I can say for my Roku box which crashes several times a week. The Fire Stick  buffers occasionally but i figure that's just the Internet watching porn and slowing things down. It was cheap and I bought it as a backup for my Roku but I'm using the Fire TV Stick more than Roku these days.When browsing movies the fast forward button does nothing. It should shift a screen at a time with FF. I hope they fix this in a future update.The Fire Stick's interface isn't as good as the Roku but they haven't had as much time to work on it. I'm pretty confident that they'll improve it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Redox"}]
