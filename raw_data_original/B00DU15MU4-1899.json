I'm a dish customer and can't download the Dish Anywhere app, Showtime, HBO GO, Cinemax and many more. I basically use it to watch ESPN and History Channel. For $99 it's pretty expensive and can't do as much as my Vizio Eco Star. However, the Fire's processor is much much faster. My guess is the inexpensive Fire Stick wll do everything this will do. Buy the Stick if you're interested in Amazon TV products and pocket the rest.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "TC_"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.

It streams high quality seamlessly even without super high speed Internet. Only drawback I've had so far is that I am out of town a lot staying in hotels which almost all use a browser based login for their wireless Internet which is not supported by the fire TV. I've found workarounds for getting Internet to my fire TV but it's a hassle I could certainly do without.In conclusion I love my fire TV, just hope that they add support for browser based Internet login in a future update (hint hint)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "P.
