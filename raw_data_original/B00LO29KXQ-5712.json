Received yesterday already registered to me.  Thankfully my TV had a USB port so I plugged Fire Stick in TV HDMI port and power cord into TV's USB port so no visible wires.  Device had several setup and how to use videos ready to go.Obviously optimized to buy and watch Amazon videos, it also makes an excellent picture slideshow and music player.  I had already bought and/or uploaded some of my music library to Amazon so I added my favorite family photos to Amazon cloud drive.  QED now I have a 46\" electronic picture frame showing my photos and playing my music.I bought during the initial pre-order so the price was excellent.  Wish I could have ordered more than one.I wish it worked with other video services or webpages but Amazon and Netflix are the only two that I recognized.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Samuel Abbe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick works amazingly well, even in an upstairs bedroom where the wifi signal is not very strong.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gene \"microman\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The idea is great but expect to pay lots of rental fees and start up fees, hulu charges and amazon rentals are not all free, netflix is also followed with charges, when all is said and done a 20$ item can cost upwards of 100$ be careful.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just great.

I have had it for about two weeks now and I watch something on it almost every night.  It is simple enough to use, just plug it in and go.  The only complaint I have about the product is that it freezes up sometimes.  I will be watching a show and it'll freeze up for about a second, make this really strange noise, and then start playing again.  Sometimes it'll do it multiple times in a show.  It does get rather annoying.  If it persists I may have to return the item.  I hope it doesn't though cause I really like most everything else about this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Paige"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought my fire tv stick on black friday sale for 25$. I should say it is well worth the money.The hardware looks very nice, it almost looks like some apple hardware in the same group.Installation was easy. I had to use the included hdmi extension cable(about 8\" long). Thanks to Amazon for including this cable as my ports were not located in a place to connect the stick directly.The remote looks very sleek, minimalist but very easy to use, after some time you don't need to look what key you're pressing because it is very easy to use.The software interface is nice. I didn't like the fact that i had to listen the tutorial in the beginning, but i guess it will help newbies. It would also be nice to have the most common used apps like netflix and youtube preinstalled.Overall i would recommend this to people who would want to turn their regular tv's into a multi functional smart tv.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "serdar"}]
