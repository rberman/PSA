I did have to call my buddy in San Francisco and put him on speaker to install it. The instructions only seem good. And I never could figure out how to use it with my Amazon Prime. BUT, unfortunately, I had to return it. Comcast made it impossibly expensive for me to cut the cable cord. And I checked first, really I did. In addition, certain applications -- CBS access, for example -- don't work with the Fire TV Stick. That's important to know. I don't remember seeing that information anywhere. I look forward to being able to end my current relationship with Comcast. I will then see what the Fire TV Stick offers. I hope CBS and Amazon are able to play well together by then.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nancy D.
