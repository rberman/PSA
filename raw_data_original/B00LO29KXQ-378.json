[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Functionality is great. It has good apps.However, I gave it 3 stars because it does not advertise a power cable that is required to be plugged into the stick and then into the wall. Based on the device it looks as though it's a wireless stick that runs when u plug it in. However, you need to have a cable plugged into the stick, then running to the nearest outlet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tracy Lynn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am really enjoying it!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "cl \"cl\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It works great, especially at hotels.
