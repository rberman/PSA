[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product!  I would give five stars if Amazon didn't restrict apps to the Amazon App store and allowed Google Play as well or if there was a better way to search for Amazon Prime movies.  If you search for Christmas movies, for instance, you have to click through dozens of rental moves to find the very few Prime movies.  WIth what I'm paying for Prime membership, I should be able to see a list of only movies that I've already paid for.  Other than those two complaints, the product is great.  There are a lot of great movies included in Prime and several good apps where you can get additional content, even more by sideloading apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Us Here"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy set up.

If you are expecting a clean, non-intrusive list of \"channels\" such as ROKU provides, you will be sorely disappointed.I don't doubt that this will be great for a specific set of users, but it is not practical in our home where we have to monitor TV programs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Robert"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We got this as a deal for Amazon prime members and it is worth it. Would be worth it at regular price. We also have roku box and a chromecast stick and all have pros and cons. I have only used it a few times but will say setup was super easy and it definitely is more user friendly than chromecast.  It is nice having the remote, which chromecast doesn't.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "brandihemphill"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.

The quality of the movies have been great. The music service is also nice as you can listen to entire songs before buying. There are great apps for TV like PBS and many others.

I heard a rumor that if your tv is older than 5 years it won't work. It worked for a day then I got \"the blue screen of death\".
