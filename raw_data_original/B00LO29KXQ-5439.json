This product worked great for about 3 weeks and then stopped connecting to my network. I spent an hour on the phone with customer service and countless emails since and apparently amazon has no desire to replace the product or to support it. I would suggest buying chromecast instead, it works, this product does not. If it had continued to work as it did for the first 3 weeks I would have given it 4 stars. The support for this product in non-existant.Addendum. The last update broke connectivity with Cisco ap's. Another user on the kindle forums found a work-around in the Cisco configuration files that will allow this to work. I now have mine up and working, no thanks to amazon cs. They have not contacted me in several days but their last email assured me they would resolve this issue soon. I will edit this review in a few weeks and adjust the rating on this item as time goes on.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Herman"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works almost flawlessly but for one thing... It will reboot randomly when browsing in and out of the menus. Setup is plugged in with the adapter but left plugged in and connected to the TV when not in use. It happens every other day but its enough to notice. Reboot time is quick which mitigates the down time but I can't figure out why.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Stephen Parris"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I've had it a week now and have yet to maintain a stable connection to my WiFi.
