[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own an Apple TV, two Roku's and the Amazon Fire.  The Amazon Fire is by far the best of the bunch.  It allows my family and I to watch what we want, when we want.  I am a cord cutter as well, so my streamer is important.  Amazing product Amazon!Note:  I plan to purchase more Amazon equipment due to the build quality and attention to detail.  Also, I do have a game controller.#awesomebuy", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "For the price a HDMI cable would have been nice....The unit is only a few days old, but it appears to be a bit \"glitchy\".....It is a \"re-furb\" after all....may send unit back if problems persist.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Matthew Regnier"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

Spent 2 hours trying to get it to work. Spent an hour on the phone with Amazon troubleshooting (3 different people) with the determination that it's probably a dead box that doesn't work which was sent to me. However, Amazon couldn't just send me a replacement since they had to do some internal checking before they could help me replace it. Very un-Amazon like. It was delivered 3 days late, didn't work, and I've been waiting 4 days since the 3 hours wasted to see if/how they can help get it replaced with one that may actually work. Huge waste of time and money so far. The Chrome stick is looking better and better. Will add a revision to the review if I ever manage to get a box that works.---Revised update: After a couple of weeks, Amazon eventually acknowledged they messed up, the box doesn't work and should have been immediately replaced by the first person I spoke to. The replacement unit worked fine and I'm mostly satisfied with it (why no off button? plus a couple other minor issues) Have updated my rating from 1 to 3.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/6", "author": "Bejan"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Needs more apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Saul Negron"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I think that the concept is great, it was very easy to installed, options are great, but the device has no on/off switch.

I spent two days setting up all the apps, accounts, etc. to get it just right, and Amazon support wants me to return whole thing. I just ordered another remote. When I get it, I'll just put the broken remote in the package, and send it back for a refund. This seems to be a common problem with the Fire TV.
