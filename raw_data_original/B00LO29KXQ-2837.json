None of my favorite Chromecast apps are on here (UFC TV, WWE Network, HBO Go) and the Netflix app seems to just open the Netflix app on my smart TV. The YouTube app is hardly usable. I bought it for Prime Video though, and so far it's a much better experience than the Prime app on my TV.Update: HBO Go and WWE Network have been added. But so have ads before videos. I can't stress this enough: if you pay for a streaming service, nothing is more offensive than seeing ads. That just makes me want to watch non-exclusive titles on Netflix when I would have preferred to watch them on Prime Video. Minus two stars. That's how much I hate ads.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JV"}]
