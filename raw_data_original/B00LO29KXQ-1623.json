I got it for our bedroom tv.  We have a Roku 3 in the living room, which replaced an old blu-ray player we used to stream shows on.  The Roku is great but I would have been better off getting a Fire Stick for in there also since it cost less and the performance and ease of use is the same as far as I can tell.The only issue I have is that our tv is older and only has one HDMI port but I have easy access to the back and can switch it back and forth easily.  Just be aware of that if you have an older tv and want to also use cable at times.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ellis E"}]
