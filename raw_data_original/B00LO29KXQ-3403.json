Coupled with the free shipping part of prime this is a great service. Easy to set up, pretty easy to use and some interesting Amazon content.

Seems to be high definition, and it can handle captions, etc.  The control unit is a little quirky, and I found it a little difficult to hunt or browse on iTunes and Amazon Prime. (Unlike Chromecast, this one does access Prime). It's less hassle than Chromecast in setup, though, since you do't need your compter to do the casting but work directly through the cable modem and TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "W.
