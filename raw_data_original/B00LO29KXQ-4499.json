There are only a few channels that it accesses. It is great if all you want do is watch Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. But Roku is the same price and offers a greater variety of channels. One of my favorites on Roku is Acorn TV, which is all British shows, but Amazon does not have even this variety. I gave it to my daughter--I have no use for it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeri Sutton Shores MA"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "leeann"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Mostly a good gadget.
