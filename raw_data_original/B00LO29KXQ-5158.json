[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Pros: This is a really nifty device I can take anywhere with me. It can easily convert a regular tv with the usb ports to a smart tv. Even better, it has features that a smart tv doesn't have. I've looked for CBS app on our LG Smart tv, but can't find it. We need to stream from the web to watch, but this little thing comes equipped with the app. The remote control is pretty awesome and makes it easier to navigate between screens. Unlike the google chrome that needs an active computer which requires you to download the chromecast app, the set up with fire stick is so much easier. You def no need a computer to watch anything. The fire tv stick comes with extra memory, but haven't really used that feature.Cons: When I tried watching The Interview from the Youtube app, it didn't work. I don't know if that was just with the interview or that was a fluke for everyone, but when I used chromecast it worked.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TJ \"TJ\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have two of these.  Overall I'm very pleased, although I was disappointed when the first one couldn't power itself from the USB port on my TV.  That TV is cheap, so the USB probably doesn't provide enough power, but the second device powers from the USB on the TV and works fine.The devices work as expected and have great integration with Amazon Prime as you would expect.  They also work well with YouTube and have apps available for Hulu and Netflix.So far though there aren't apps for everything yet.  For example the HBO app in the Kindle store doesn't work with Fire TV yet.But overall I like them and are well worth the money.  Just watch where you place them in relation to your router because they get a lot of interference being behind the TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael A.

Last night I heard two \"pops\" and the tv screen error message said \"this content requires HDCP for playback and this was an unauthorized use\". I lost the tv picture and the cable box wouldn't work. I plugged in my Apple TV and received the same error message. Per instructions from Sony support, I unplugged all devices including the tv..which rebooted  the tv, cable box and Apple TV. The Fire Stick still had the error message and again shut all HDMI ports down. Everything is working fine without the Fire Stick and it is on it way back to Amazon..too bad...very dissapointing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Sara Rivka"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "excellent no problems", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "timothy walsh"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Not sure yet. Works fine. Fast/responsive. Not very many apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Greg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I ordered Fire TV Stick before it was released, and while Amazon was running a promotion for the Prime members. It arrived about three weeks sooner than it was originally promised.Product itself works really well, and I had some idea what to expect since I already own and use Google Chromecast. Difference between Chromecast and Fire TV Stick is that you don't have to use your phone to control the device. With the included remote control, you can browse and play apps, movies, tv shows, games, basically anything you want to do on the TV screen, you can do with remote control. I like this feature. The only disadvantage is that now there is another remote control added to our collection. That all said, Amazon recently released an \"Amazon Fire TV Remote\" app on iOS that lets you do all (or more) of tasks from your phone. This helps when you need to type movie names, etc. In fact, you don't have to type, you can just speak to it. It works really well in my opinion.I took one of my friends' advice and plugged it to power with the included adapter, as he mentioned USB from the TV does not seem to provide enough power to run it as smooth. I did not do extensive testing on this, but plugged in to the wall outlet, it performs very smoothly.Content wise, the biggest thing we miss is the Xfinity app, which Chromecast doesn't have either (Xbox 360 has an app for it). However, I am not sure whose decision that is. That all said, Amazon Prime does have lots of content, especially if you are looking into finding new TV shows. It's an easy and cheap way to check out shows and see if you like them - if you have missed the first seasons on TV. Once you catch up, you can watch the current episodes on TV, Xfinity app, or Hulu.Fire TV Stick is also supposed to support Miracast, however, I did not get a chance to use that quite yet. Finally, you can play games if you bought the controller, or with the remote. When you search for games, you could filter your results to search for games that are playable by the remote.In conclusion, this is a really good device to have, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. I really like mine, and would definitely recommend it to a friend. If you are not a Prime member however, it's doesn't have loads of features that blows away the competition. I should note that it seems more responsive (faster) than Chromecast. Also, remember to not get carried away with which streaming stick (device) has how many channels, etc. I find that I use only a handful of apps. Just because it has a billion apps doesn't mean it's better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amoinus \"amoinus\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Fire Stick! \ud83d\ude0d", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alice Burrows"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Ad infers plenty of free viewing with prime....not so", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "2swifts"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Vee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Loving it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carol White"}]
