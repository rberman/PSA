It was easy to use.  I can move it from one HDTV to another without any additional set up.  The remote makes it easier to move around the menus. The stick does gives you suggestions based on what you watch.  I still have to explore all the features.  I even found some educational programs for my son.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. E. Vanleer \"maven\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic little device.
