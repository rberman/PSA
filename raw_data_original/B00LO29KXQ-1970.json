I wasn't sure I wanted to get one due to some of the negative reviews on here, but decided to purchase it anyway. I watch programs on this all the time since I got rid of my cable TV.  However, you do have to have a pretty good internet speed to stream the programs.  I do get freezes and blips sometimes, but largely due to the internet. The Fire App they have for smart phones works great--you can use that to say what program you want, and it will find it from the voice recognition software.  I am quite impressed.  Great product, Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Cocoa's Mom"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I just bought it. It is working.

I thought Sling TV would actually work better on a fire stick but I was wrong. I bought the fire stick primarily to convert my dumb HDTV to a smart one and it works well. I believed that Amazon has a good reputation and they work with their supplies to deliver the best product. I was depending on the fire stick to deliver Sling TV without disruptions because of their association with you. Netflicks delivers movies without issues why can't Sling TV deliver?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tom Marshall"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE AMAZONE PRIME AND FIRE STICKS ARE EASY TO USE.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Has worked as promised.
