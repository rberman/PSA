Just make sure you do the install step by step as explained.

It has given him some issues one of which required him to reset the device completely. It works with Plex which is a huge plus versus Apple TV. He has done very well with using it and is not technically savvy at all. If you are a prime member it integrates with all of that wonderfully as well, including the Amazon prime pictures syncing to be viewed on your TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Derek F."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love that fact that you watch a whole lot of movies and tv shows and I can take it with me", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jewel Shufford"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my new Amazon Fire TV stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jonna  lamb"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this so much we purchased two --- one for each room", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jeff willer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "We've had Roku for a few months and wanted to buy something else for another TV that was cheaper. We used this Amazon stick for a couple days then sent it back. It was far more complicated than the Roku. Also, because it is a stick it is constantly loading. I guess we are just loyal to the Roku 3. It may be a great buy for someone else just not us.
