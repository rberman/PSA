I prefer devices being dormant and not connecting to the mother ship until I am ready.

I have had a kindle fire for about a year, and watch very little tv these days, only watching a few programs on my kindle.  Now I can watch these programs on my big screen, and most of them free with my Amazon prime account.  I am seriously considering getting rid of my satellite dish now and saving some money.  This is the first I have even seen an HD program on my television and I am impressed.  Watching TV is not a high priority for me, but the fire TV stick seems perfect for my needs.  I am always pleased with Amazon.  I'm becoming an Amazon woman for sure!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dianne"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing just how much you get FREE with Amazon Prime!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lukesuther2"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Good for those who want to see movies.

With comparing all the devices together there are some big pluses with the Fire Stick TV. Samsung Smart TV's are great if you get one with good guts as different models and sizes of TV's have different RAM and CPU's which is very noticeable. Chromecast is a great device as it connects well to your mobile device or computer to stream content to your TV. The Fire Stick loads faster for me than the Chromecast and does not require to be connected to a mobile device or computer to stream content to, the fire stick tv has a well done remote that works easily.Roku 3 is probably the device to compare and TV Streamer to as it has a large content library and loads fast and stream well.Only slight drawbacks with the FireStick TV is that the menu is a bit cluttered but becomes familiar with limited use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Nathan Bonds \"Bzero007\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "We got it as soon as it came out.  Our wireless router is far from our TV and I hoped that this might work better than my Apple TV in capturing the wireless signal for TV purposes. I'd have to say the Apple TV is doing better.The viewing options here are in a way complementary to Apple TV, and being able to stream directly from Amazon Prime is a big plus. So, at the price, it's probably still worth getting.  I'm sure it's excellent if your wireless coverage is stronger than mine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Pand"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Not only did this come a month earlier than expected but what an awesome tool.

Turned our older Phillips Hi-Def TV into a smart TV. The picture is fantastic and the phone app feature makes it tremendously easy to use. Amazon Prime is a must option.

It's only flaw is the home button is right above the play button which sends me home a little too often. l also love that you can use an app as the remote.
