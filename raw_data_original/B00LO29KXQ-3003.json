[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "We have a mixed review of the Amazon Fire Stick. We found the initial set up process to be easy and was able to readily use it quickly. Unfortunately, the picture quality is not great. For example, any character dialouge that might be displayed while watching a show is difficult to read.We have had one episode (so far) where accessing content was a problem. We had to re-register in order to regain access, which was a pain.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Larry Beck"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my fire stick.  easy to use and everything we need to watch are tv shows and prime movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Running Mom"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love my Fire TV Stick, I'd love it 5 stars worth if it didn't require hacking to install apps like Kodi but all in all its well worth the price and I no longer need to turn my computer on to stream movies and TV shows to my TV. I especially like that I can power it from the built in USB ports on my TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DuhGuh from Brooklyn"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great Product. Sometimes the Internet Connection is a bit spotty sometimes. Also Comcast doesn't link with many of the apps and it is bulls*** that that isn't made more clear.

I was using my son's x-box to watch ESPN+ and it was good but not great. The fire stick never looses connection. It does get hot if I use the USB power I purchased. Using the power source that came with it fixes that problem. Couldn't be happier...bought additional one for gift!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dawn D.

The FireTV is not even in the same league as Roku and somewhat comparable to AppleTV. It's slow, continually reboots, less features and just all around less quality. In my opinion, Roku continues to be the leader and best option for television streaming. Do yourself a favor and go Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MarkR"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great device. The remote app for your phone our tablet is awesome.

There may be a solution for having Firestick plugged in and the antenna at the same time without blurriness; however, I have not found the solution yet. Currently, we have to unplug the firestick to watch our antenna channels.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "wendy"}]
