Finally a fire stick became available at our local bestbuy so I picked it up. While the home screen and layout is by far more attracting and appealing(interface) than the other 2, the wifi connection is worst  and it picks which video files it wants to play. We run a media server in our house using plex, and that's our main use of any of these streaming devices, the fire stick wouldn't play half the content through plex.  I would go on another tv and try the roku and the same files would play just fine. Maybe after a few more months they will fix that part then maybe I'll switch out all of our rokus for the fire stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ken Hollins \"FantasyKing\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The problem I am having is getting access to Netflix.

I prefer the Fire TV stick's remote controls to having to use my phone or iPad as the remote.
