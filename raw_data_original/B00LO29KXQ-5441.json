[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought mine at the $20 price when first launched.  It works well and I like having the included remote.  At the $40 price point I'd probably go with a Chromecast if you don't mind casting.You can side load other apps on this fairly easy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bimmerman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Greatest thing to TV since the invention of the flat screen! I LOOOOOVE this unit: small, unnoticable and easy to install. Just plug it in, plug the provided USB power cord and adapter in, turn your set on to the apropriate input selection, and follow the prompts! You get complete access to all of your library contents, Prime contents, purchases, music, and New-Release Movie rental. I love that I can use it for my Netflix account, too . . . not that I really NEED it with all the stuff I can access on Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G. E.

My only problem was getting audio to work thru my receiver.  The tech I talked to at Amazon wasn't sure if I could plug the Stick directly into my receiver.  So I searched online, and found that the competitors were able to connect directly to receivers.  So, I gave it a try, and it worked GREAT.This little device is very fast and easy to use.  I was afraid my wifi would not be fast enough.  But movies stream without any buffering or voice lag.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is beyond a doubt the easiest technology device to install and get up and running.

The HD picture is excellent and the variety of TV shows  and movies that are included is pretty good.  My only complaint would be the amount of content, including TV shows, that you still need to pay for even with an Amazon Prime membership. But all in all I would say I have enjoyed it so far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John M."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Not as good as my ROKU, but the ROKU was $99 and the Fire Stick was $39.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rene Tricou"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Outstanding ...  received it earlier than promised and it works very well.

Easy to set up.  We were having some issues with using our Blu Ray to view things on Amazon Prime.  I decided to try this and see if it was any better.  Yes, it is better.
