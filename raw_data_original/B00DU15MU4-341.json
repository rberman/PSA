It seems that you need a cable subscription for some of the apps to work. otherwise your paying around the same price as cable to watch a few channels.  Also they are over 2 seasons behind on most of the sitcoms my wife likes to watch.  so we have to keep our cable service or pay $3 per show.  I was hoping I was going to save some money converting to Amazon Fire TV but it is pretty much the same if not more than cable TV.  The only thing that I uses it for really is to play games that I received for free when I bought the product. It is cheaper that a PlayStation or Xbox but if you have one they I wouldn't waste your money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Andrew Dziekan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This works better than I expected.

When I pause to read the subtitle a information bar pops up at the bottom of the screen basically blocking the subtitle which negates the purpose of pausing.  I have Apple TV on the other room with second TV and I never get this issue.  Actually when I watch Amazon prime movie I don't have issue either.  Only with the Netflix application it does that.
