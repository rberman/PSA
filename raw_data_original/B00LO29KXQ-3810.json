Let's just get that out of the way!However, this thing seems to have stopped working as time goes on. I ordered it right away, and really dug it. The stream was smooth, no connection problems, good picture. Now, a few months later, I have none of those. It rarely connects, and when it does the image freezes for half a second to a couple seconds approximately every 10 seconds! You keep thinking it will go away, but it won't. You can't really get involved in a show with so much stopping.I have my Playstation 3 set up right next to it on the other HDMI outlet, and the PS3 streams better, and has far less connection issues. I don't know if this is just my Stick TV, but right now it's a dud. Also, the wheel is kind of creaky! A slight audible annoyance for those who are easily annoyed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BraMaster"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rose Gesell"}]
