[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have been a big Roku supporter over the years, setting up one for my parents, my in-laws, and various other friends and family.  Ordered this for my wife's aunt and uncle.  Have worked with various different models and never had any issues, easy setup - JUST EASY.This thing was a totally different story.Days 1, 2:  would not connect to their Cisco Valet router.  My labtop, phone, their laptops and phones all connected without issue to the router.  Got error that it could connect to the wireless, but not the local network.  Spent tons of time googling the issue and changing various router settings.  Since it takes about 3 minutes to boot, it was a very painful to troubleshoot.  I am not inexperienced at troubleshooting network issues.  I  finally got it to connect after 2 days.  I had to take it to another network, update the software, change some settings in a secret menu) before I could get it to connect.  Success! (or so I thought)Days 3:  Now that I was finally able to connect to the internet, I set up their Netflix channel and a couple of other channels.  The loading times for each channel were 30-60 seconds each.  The menus were not responsive at all.  It also took a very long time to start streaming a video, but we were finally able to stream videos.  However, after about 2-3 minutes of streaming, the unit would stop playing and reset itself (cue 3 minute boot cycle).  I was never able to have it stream anything for more than five minutes without resetting itself.Since I had spent on the order of 5 hours troubleshooting what should have been a 15 minute setup, I decided to return the product and get a model that I knew worked.  I ordered a Roku 1, had it set up in 15 minutes with no issues and moved on with my life.I highly suggest you avoid this product.  Good idea in theory, but not ready for primetime.Get a ROKU (1, 2, or 3) or a CHROMECAST depending on your needs", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "17/20", "author": "W.

Like plug in part, taking no space..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "WILLIAM RAYL"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I'll start with the fact that I have an older Roku also that I absolutely love. When I saw this one, I figured it would be perfect since it would plug right into the back of my new tv.  Setting it up was easy, took some time to input all the passwords, but after 20 minutes it was good to go.Problem started when I turned the tv back on a few hours later. I had a message saying I needed to sync my Roku remote (which I had done during the initial setup). After syncing the remote, I had to start the setup from scratch, taking another 20 minutes.  Next day, same issue.  Synced the remote again, reset everything and searched for some option that maybe I had missed somewhere. Next day, same issue, so I tried the Roku chat support.  Of course, the support person had me re-sync the remote - then go through the entire process of setting it up again.  He had me to go to a \"secret\" Roku screen, although he  didn't really have any clue once we got there.  He finally admitted he didn't know what was wrong.Next day - same thing.  Resync the remote.  I tried calling the phone support this time - tried to talk to a woman with limited English and she was obviously in a busy calling center - I could hear other support folks better than I could hear her.  Her first advice, resync the remote - no, I've done that 6 times already.  It wasn't some interference issue as she suggested because once the remote was on, every function worked just fine until the Roku \"fell asleep.\"  Her next piece of advice was to call my cable company and see if they could do anything - obviously not a network issue, everything else in the house works fine including the old Roku and even the new stick, once the remote was synced.Finally, she told me she couldn't help me unless I could \"prove\" I was having an issue.  Huh?  How?  Try it on another tv.  Well, I don't have another tv with an HDMI port.  She then told me I should contact family or neighbors and try my Roku on their tvs.  Seriously????  I'm going to walk through my neighborhood knocking on doors asking if anyone has a newer tv with an empty HDMI port and a USB and do they mind me connecting to their network???After walking away for a few days, I tried it again.  Still could not \"wake it up.\"  Being extremely frustrated I started just pushing all the buttons and holding them down and suddenly,  click, the Roku woke up.  All settings were still there and it worked fine. Now every day I use it, I do this little dance and say a wake-up prayer - sometimes it wakes up in a minute, sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes not at all.I'm not an idiot when it comes to this stuff, but I haven't been able to figure out what combination of buttons wake this thing up - there seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.Bottom line - when it's on, it works great. When it goes to sleep, it really goes to sleep and is pretty much dead and useless.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. Sieger"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!

As long as you have an HDMI port and a USB port then you are set up. It comes with a power cable also, but I didn't want to have to plug two plugs into the wall. With the portable tv, all I have to do is move the tv and the Roku stays plugged in all the time. It works great just like the other Rokus we have. The only things I will say is different is that the Stick is a litter slower than the Roku 3. The 3 is the fastest of all the Rokus and it holds true with the newest version, the Roku Stick. This Stick is very convenient however. We just came back from a trip to South Dakota. We were able to bring the Stick with us and plug it into the Hotel tv and watch all our normal programs. I would recommend this if you need it for space saving or portability. Otherwise I would still go with the Roku 3. Either way...., Roku is awesome. It saves on paying for cable or satellite tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C. Walker"}]
