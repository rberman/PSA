I decided to give this a go as I got it on the special $19.00 price. I guess you can call it an impulse buy.  Anyway, after i played with it this weekend. I love it! It's super snappy and fast to use the menu navigation. I know it's wrong to say that Roku is not user friendly but i find the layout on Amazon's stick is better!! The remote is thin and light weight.  It's Super easy to hook up.  The app is even better cuz u can use voice search, Or type in what you want to watch.  As opposed to arrow keys and a screen keyboard.  All in all.... I should have waited till the end of this year and gotten this stick as opposed to the roku and the chromecast.  But I do have a wife and brother to shop for this christmas??? guess what will be in their stockings!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ryan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome purchase!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aidan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Schwieet"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I do own Chromecast, Roku and Fire TV Stick. I am satisfied with Chromecast for watching Youtube but could not watch amazon instant movies. That is only reason for me to buy Roku and then this item. My initial experience is that there is no difference between Roku vs Fire stick. They work same and the things that I did not like with Roku also come along with this one. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who already owns Roku streamer.Update 01/02/2015: I got to change the review that I wrote earlier. This tv stick rocks with lots of potential. I installed few 3rd party app and the stick could perform very well. I am changing it to 4 star.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "S.
