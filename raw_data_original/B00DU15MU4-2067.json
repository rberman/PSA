I imagine I would've saved myself a considerable amount for roughly the same thing.  WiFi instead of hard-wired is about the only drawback I see, but for Prime members, like myself, I could pre-order this item for $19.  I went back and forth before I purchased the Fire TV in August during a promotional price of $84.  Disappointed in Amazon (or maybe myself) for not holding out more for the Stick version at 25% of the cost.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Andrew"}]
