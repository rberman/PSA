The interface is fast and seamless. My TV is already a smart tv but I prefer the stick over the smart because it is way faster; loading, responding; etc.The only gripes would be that it forgot my Netflix information and I had to enter it all over again. thankfully the android app has a keyboard making this a lot easier. The second gripe would be that the Apple apps arent out yet.Other than that the Prime streaming content and the performance are better than expected from a device that I can put in my pocket.:)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angus \"dj_fubarius\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Connectivity is great.
