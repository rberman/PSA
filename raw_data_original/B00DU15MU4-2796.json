[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Disappointing.  Roku 2 and 3 are much preferred.  There is nothing about the Fire I would rate higher.  I bought it with Prime - going to cancel ...  Better selection of movies on Netflix plus HBO-GO and TWC.  Even Roku2 has a better interface in my opinion and is only marginally slow almost unnoticeable using wireless vs Enet cable for the Fire", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dexter S.

I have an HDMI connection to my TV and an Optical Connection to my Dolby 7 Sound System.  HD Video is excellent and audio delivers Dolby sound separation accurately.

My Second Star is for not needing an instruction book because once you turn it on, it asks how YOU want it set up!  Third Star is for the \"World's Simplest Remote!\"  (Took me about 2- minutes to memorize ALL). Fourth Star is for the very large amount of movies, t.v. shows, games and apps available and the Fifth Star is for the Amazon Prime which then gives you over 200,000 movies and More Shows, etc.  AND, you get the first 30-days of Amazon Prime for FREE with the Amazon Fire TV!  Recommended for anyone tired of paying those hefty cable or satellite bills each month!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Denise"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "On the seventh day God rented...This is a VERY good product. The voice recognition is superb and makes it easy even for my 80 year old mother to watch scathing films of half naked men. It simply works and it works reliably too.
