[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own and love the Amazon Fire TV Box. I bought the Fire Stick at its introductory price to Prime members for $19.99 based on the promise that the product would soon be usable in hotels. My patience paid off. Fire Stick is worthy travel companion. The set up takes less than a minute once you get the hang of it and the Fire Stick works flawlessly. A couple of bits of advice. First, in order for Fire Stick to work in hotels, it needs the automatic software update. So, plug it in on your home system first! The update will take about 10 minutes. I tried to use Fire Stick right out of the box in a hotel and it wasn't able to connect to the hotel portal page. Also, the directions instruct you to plug the Fire Stick directly into your TV's HDMI inputs. If you do this, you will only be able to us your TV's speaker. I plugged my Fire Stick into one of my Sound Bar's HDMI inputs and the sound flowed beautifully.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Terrier Fan"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "works well  own profiles not like if went to netflix on portable device easy to install", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Cheryl Denton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love all the amazon products.  this is awsome...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "keith gatzemeyer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've had the Fire TV Stick for a while.  I also have a Roku 3 and a Roku Stick.  All are great little streaming devices, but the Fire TV Stick has a few features that make it stand out.First, the selection of apps is pretty impressive on the stick for it being so new.  That should only improve as developers can leverage their Android dev skills.  Second, it's a no brainer if you're a Prime member.  Now with Prime music playlists, it's even better.  Please just add Prime stations next, Amazon.  Finally, the fact I can take this with me on the road and use it in a hotel is amazing.  I just tried this yesterday and it worked flawlessly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marcus \"Marcus Schmidt\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We've never used anything else to compare it too, but it's great for what we wanted!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BN Flowers"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "best with plex app", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Neddal Ayad"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product. Easy to install and use. Also own 2 Chromecast and prefer the fire stick. The remote is a nice feature as people don't always have a smartphone available to use as a remote.

Due to the tv being flush mounted I cannot use the power adapter because it just will not fit. Trying to browse channels is horrid, the delay in response is super slow.
