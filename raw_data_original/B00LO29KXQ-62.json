For me, I plugged it in, watched the little introduction, and marveled at the interface/ease of use. That was the first day. Now, three days later, it's practically inoperable. It freezes up, lags in between commands, randomly closes out of applications, and makes watching anything so utterly frustrating. I am an admitted Amazon junkie and Prime subscriber, so for an Amazon product to be so bad it warrants a negative review, all I can say is DISAPPOINTED.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Heather Q"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The best.
