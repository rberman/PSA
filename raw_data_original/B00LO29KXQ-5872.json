For me the Fire Stick is awesome because it works without internet. It can access local media without complaining about the lack of an internet connection. I put it in my van, with a monitor and a little file server/wifi hotspot box and now my kids have a cheap but effective entertainment system for those long trips.I don't care for the interface, it's clean and simple, but if you have a lot of apps/media/etc it becomes tedious very quickly. They neglected to give you a voice search button on the remote, so unless you want to pickup your phone(firetv app) as well as the remote, navigating can be a real pain.On the plus side, you can sideload apps, there are far more functional apps for the fire stick than what amazon wants to admit to.On the negative side, screen mirroring is junk, if you can get it to work at all, and if you can find it hiding deep in the settings menu. Amazon really dropped the ball here since it's obvious competition is the chromecast.All in all, I'd say it's the best tv stick out there considering what you get vs what you paid, but it's still not that one perfect media solution.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Screwyluie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick installed easily and is remarkably fast.  The Stick was purchased for a TV other than the one we mainly watch which has the Fire TV installed with it.  So, the with the Stick we have given up the ability to speak commands to the tv in lieu of having to use the controller to index to the item we want.  However, I am going to download the app to my phone that allows me to use that as a controller which should be superior to the remote that comes with the Stick...although it works great and is very responsive when working with the Stick.  Overall  the Stick is so much more powerful than the Roku that I replaced.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charlie G"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!

I'd say that this works well and for the price, it couldn't be beat. Lately, I've been having some issues loading Prime TV when I'm not having any issues on my XBox One. This wasn't the issue when I first bought it, so maybe it's a bug.Anyways, ease of use is terrific and performance rivals the Chromecast. It's very light and portable. The included remote is a bonus and works well. Now, I can watch Prime TV shows/movies almost anywhere with this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MkVsTheWorld"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This meets all my expectations.
