Have had multiple flavors of Roku and this blows it out of the water.It is quick, responsive, wifi speed is good enough for streaming HD without issue.  Runs Plex without issue.Only downside is you're limited to the Amazon app store unless you know how to sideload apps, and even then, if they're not designed for the FireTV, you may want to have a keyboard and mouse handy to replicate touch.  So Apps like NBC Live Extra and Udemy are not available.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "P. Clark"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really awesome product, I use it every day. As a Prime member it makes Prime Instant Video content really easy to access, but at the same time allows me to go to Netflix and HBO go which I also watch.
