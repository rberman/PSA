Extremely easy connection and set-up and adds tons of access to a non-smart TV.  I'm on a 30-day trial Prime membership and the free Prime Instant Video sealed the deal.  I'll be buying a full membership for sure.We have a smart TV in the living room but this makes our second set so much more useful.  Navigation through Amazon and non-Amazon apps is easy enough.  A full keyboard would be nice for searching titles but at this price-point that's an unreasonable expectation.If I was a gamer, I'd look for a more high-end device.  This fits my needs nicely, for streaming video.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mick"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have time to write this review while I restart my Fire TV stick for the third time in 10 minutes. It is tough to watch anything when the device drops the wireless network frequently. No matter what I do this keeps happening and Amazon has no solution.We have two Roku boxes that never fail. I would rather pay for a Roku than accept a free Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "bwholst"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best ever investment", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "John E.
