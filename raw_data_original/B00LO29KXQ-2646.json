We've cut cable.  Very, very easy to install and set up in just a few minutes. Like the remote. The voice search via the iPhone or iPad  works like a charm. Connecting mostly so far with Netflix and Amazon Prime TV but also can connect to Hulu plus, Sling and more.  Loading is sufficiently fast and streaming goes well without interruptions for buffering. Got it free as part of Sling TV promo.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thomas M. Bay"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product for a great price.

Both have their strengths and weaknesses.Ultimately I like the Amazon Fire TV Stick more because of one key factor: Amazon Prime. Most shoppers here probably have Amazon Prime, so why not make the use of it by being able to stream Prime to your TV? Google Chromecast does not include the Amazon App, so unless you have another functioning means like a Blu-Ray player, video game console, or SMART TV that has this capability - then the Google Chromecast is not the way to go.However, the Amazon Fire TV stick has one functionality flaw that Google Chromecast wins at: the ability to cast websites or stream local files directly to your TV. Amazon Fire TV Stick can stream local files by means of a third party app \"Plex\" - but this service is subscription based or a one time hefty fee. I do in fact pay for this service, but I would much rather have it as an added value feature that comes with the Amazon Fire TV Stick.Also, the handheld remote makes things a lot easier to navigate than the Google Chromecast. Instead of having to use my laptop to cast what I want played, I can just flick through whatever app I want and get streaming.I think if Amazon added more value to the device, then they would steal the market hands-down. I look forward to any updates and upgrades they may launch. I am ultimately happy despite the fact that I have to pay a subscription fee to stream local files.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark Reviewer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great for streaming and works amazing in Hotels as well.

Ahh....I'm not sure how to begin. It outputs in 1080p. It plays movies, shows and games from a variety of sources. It has a bluetooth remote (i.e. no pointing like IR remotes). It's small.
