I like that the stick fits behind the TV and gets power from the TV USB port. I also like that the remote uses RF (radio) verses IR (infrared). This mean that you don't have to point the remote at the TV.If your TV is wall mounted you might want to look and see if the HMDI port(s) are facing to the back, or if they face to the side. If they face to the back make sure you have enough clearance between the HDMI jack and the wall to install the Roku stick. My TV had a side mounted HDMI port so I had no issues.The only criticism I can see is the stick does take about 30 seconds when switching from one service to another. But I cost is a concern I would recommend. If cost is not a concern you might want to purchase one of the other Roku boxes which cost a little more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven Alpha"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great.

Tons of applications you can add on to the roku box. I've owned the roku streaming stick, roku box 3, chromecast,  matricom g-box mx2, and the fire tv.  The design of this platform is better than the fire tv.  But the Amazon firetv is hands down the best streaming device on the market.
