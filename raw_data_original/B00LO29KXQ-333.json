Even though I can pull the same video up on my laptop (through Amazon Prime) and run it through an hdmi cable to my tv and it is in perfect hd.  Same story ALL the time.  The stick was suppose to add convenience.  It is  all but useless.  Sad to say. Really wanted it to work.  Admittedly, it's not the first product I've had with inexplicable streaming problems, but I was hoping for more from Amazon. Oh,  and I know about having it extend away from the tv.  I have the extension cable hooked up and the cable as far from the tv as the cable will allow.  If it's not far enough.....well, you gave me the cable.
