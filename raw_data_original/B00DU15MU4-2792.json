I had everything connected and running in 5 minutes, but Amazon FireTV won't accept my sign-in information. It just says \"Sign-in failed\" over and over again.

I guess I'll just return it and go purchase a competing product. I'm also re-thinking my Prime membership, as it is clearly less valuable since I can't even stream it using Amazon's own device.Poor form, Amazon.

The update sold me on this exceptional product. It's faster than Roku, not much, and the graphics are exceptional. I'm keeping both devices as the Roku has more services/offers. I recommend both, they're nip n' tuck. I intend to reduce my dependence on Comcast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/12", "author": "slouchybud"}]
