Plus the software won't let you play videos from a USB stick.  However I rooted the fire TV and installed some software which can.

I just wish there were more free movies than there are.  We don't get to go to the movies and enjoy it when they come on TV.  An example is \"Catching Fire\" is free but \"Hunger Games\" is $5.99.  My husband hasn't seen the first movie yet and would like to see it first.  As a \"Prime\" member, there needs to be much more for free.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Katherine"}]
