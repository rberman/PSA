It's faster than my Roku 3 and I think it's a lot more portable.  My baby was in the hospital and I took this and plugged it into the room's television.  I hooked it up to their wifi in seconds and was watching Amazon Instant Video, Netflix and Pandora.I would give this a 5 star, but it's lacking in channels.  Mind you it has some cool games for it, and that I like.  But I wish it had the Feeln app (Hallmark) and especially that the company would allow PlayOn to have a channel available.The Roku still beats it when it comes to the number of channels and Private channels.Pros: Faster than the Roku 3, Portable, Easy to Use, Quick SetupCons: Lack of specific channels and the variety of channel selection (without a cable/satellite subscription).  Not all games available on Amazon work for the Fire TV Stick.  They work for the Fire TV, just not the stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I'm sending this thing back.  It can't even play Prime video well.  The talk track is out of sync with the video. My Roku 3 plays Prime video just fine. It also locked up once so it needed to be power cycled to reset it.  Real PITA considering it is plugged into the HDMI behind the TV.  After power cycling it had forgotten everything and I had to re-enter all the settings.Looks like Amazon went for \"specs\" instead of proper operation... probably rushed it out without testing.  I had bought 3 more for gifts.  Needless to say, I won't inflict this ill-conceived thing on anyone I care about.  So anyhow, Amazon will be getting all four of these back.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Tom Swift \"Tom\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just got this a few days ago.  I have to say i am very impressed.I don't have a fast internet connection, DSL, but I have been streaming with no issues.  The movies and TV shows load quickly and they remember the location you were at if you go back.I thought I had a trial version of Prime but it turns out i bought it.

I love how Fire TV Stick works independently to stream things with no need for a phone or laptop or tablet, but is still capable of casting apps from such devices. Having a remote is very convenient and helps set it apart from similar stick-style streaming products. I was able to snag one of these for $19 as a Prime member pre-order and I am very happy with the quality of product I got for that price. Even at full price the Fire TV Stick is a much better deal than a Chromecast in my opinion. It's a great device!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "B.

You only have access to about 20 channels and if you subscribe to any channels you are unable to get them .  Amazon's description of this product is misleading.  You do have access to 200,000 SHOWS, if you are a prime subscriber but not 200,000 CHANNELS.  In addition I can't seem to get the display in widescreen, ONLY full screen.

Tried it on NetFlix and Amazon Prime videos. The only way to solve the static is to unplug the power and then re-plug.This only last about an hour before the static issue resurface.Bought it for 20 bucks as a pre-order.Update:12/20/2014.Got an email from Amazon Customer Service today to contact Amazon Support. I follow instructions and got on the phone with Amazon Support. It was a very courteous call. Still didn't get issue resolved. I got transferred twice to James, a FireTV tech; he put me on hold to review my account (not sure what have to do with FireTV Stick issue). With both transfer, I let the techs hear the static & garble audio; video seems unaffected. This happens with both Amazon Prime and NetFlix videos.After 10 minutes, my on-hold call got dropped. Haven't heard back from Amazon Support. Trying to reply to Amazon CS email got a delivery error.For now, my only fix is to disconnect the power, basically reset. This will fix it for about an hour. The FireTV Stick gets unusually warm, close to hot, after an hour. I turned on close caption. Really want this to work.12/31/14.Amazon Support sent a replacement FireTV Stick (no accessories) on 12/21/14. Received it on 12/24/14. It took about 10 minutes initially to update (automated) the firmware. After a few days of running NetFlix, still the same symptom: static & garble sound after 1.5 hour. The FireTV Stick feels extra warm to touch. Either turn off the TV or pull the power from the FireTV stick, and then restart; this will fix it for a good 1 hour. When the FireTV Stick goes into sleep mode or at a video pause for an extended time, un-pause the video will be met with static and garble audio. Video is unaffected throughout the audio issue.The kids like the convenience and ease of use with the accompany remote.Already tried ferric choke on the microUSB cable and the accompanied HDMI extension. Didn't get any better. The TV is a Sony 24\" Playstation 3D TV.May be this weekend I'll try: - with a non-Amazon extension HDMI cable - a different TVSee if it gets any better.The one star review still holds.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "AlphaTrio"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Way cool", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lorenb"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product for the price especially for the Amazon Users.
