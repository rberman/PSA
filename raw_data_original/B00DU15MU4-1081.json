I love the product but been having one huge issue and Amazon hasn't been able to help.  I keep getting an error about the Hdmi cable.  I called Amazon and they told me to try a new Hdmi cable.  Did that.  Issue didn't resolve.  They asked me to reboot the Amazon fire TV.  Did that, still didn't help.  They told me to try a different Hdmi port on my tv, I did that and then it worked.  But now I get that error multiple times a week and need to switch the Hdmi ports before anything works.  The funny thing...my blueray player uses the same Hdmi cable and either port and it works fine.  So I know it's not my tv.  I think it's the Amazon fire device.  Does anyone else have this issue?  I want mine exchanged for a new one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Caitlynn Jahr"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to set up.

It works better than my smart TV/Blu Ray player.Loads content faster than my smart devices and doesn't drop the WiFi signal like my \"smart\" devices.Fire TV is definetly a very good product. The only limitation I have found is that it doesn't have the Cinimax App (MaxGo).Having this and Amazon Prime and a Netflix subscription is a must to truly benifit from Fire TV.As for the games, there seems to be a lot of them. Haven't had a chance to truly check them out. But so far it just seems to be bonus over Fire TVs competitors.Four instead of five stars for not having MaxGo.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ronnie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Back in November, I received the Fire TV Stick, purchased when it was offered to Prime members for $20. I loved it and used it constantly- I've probably tripled the weekly time I spend at the TV now that I have a much more reliable connection to Amazon Instant Video content (vs my Vizio's slow and cumbersome built-in app). Then I discovered that I could easily side load apps onto it, including XBMC/Kodi. Once I was up and running with Kodi, I quickly retired and sold my jailbroken 2nd Gen Apple TV, which was pretty much only being used as an XBMC player for my network content and for Netflix- both things the Fire TV Stick was better at (no more buffering in Netflix, and shows pretty much start immediately on the Fire TVs). In addition to the performance bump, the upgrade from 720p to 1080p was a welcome change. With the money I made back from selling my Apple TV, I decided to upgrade to the full Fire TV, and relocate the stick on an old PC monitor with an HDMI port that wasn't being used. I never had any problems with the Fire TV stick, I really just wanted the upgrade for the ethernet port (I've got a wireless bridge in my media center), the USB port (for my xbox wireless controller receiver), and the much better remote (and it's quite a bit better than I was expecting). Over the Fire TV Stick, the Fire TV is also a lot more responsive and renders games a bit better too.I've been very happy with both of my Fire TV product purchases, and I'm constantly recommending them to my friends.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Spacecat"}]
