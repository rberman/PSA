However, after a week of use, the Netflix app started to hesitate and lag every minute or so. I have an XBOX that I compared the streaming on, and had no issues with Netflix. So, clearly there's an issue with FireTV Stick and it's Netflix app.If they can figure out the Netflix bug my rating would be 5/5 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.

I already have a Roku box, but for the promotional price, I went ahead and bought it. first off it does what it does pretty well. It is fast and responsive, but if you own Apple devices, it does nothing new. It would be worth the price if I could mirror from my iPad, but you can't, and it doesn't appear that this will ever support that.The other annoyance is the RF remote, because of this I can not program me Logitech remote to control this. Now I have to have a separate remote, which is small and easily misplaced, They claim to have an IOS remote app next spring, but I could care less about using my phone as a remote, but it would be useful if you lose the supplied remote.As no surprise, the stick is prime-centric.  It's interface is built in, while Netflix is a separate channel. Not a big deal, but if you don't subscribe to prime, it doesn't make much sense to buy this.In short, if you're an android owner subscribing to prime and don't care about universal remote compatibility, this is a nice product, otherwise it's probably not worth it.This is also a wireless only device, which I suspect that most people want, but I have wire to my TV and much prefer the dependability and performance of a wired device although I was surprised how well the video streamed, but it does have a some buffering everytime I watch a movie, something that rarely happens with a wired Roku. Also since using this just before Christmas I have had to disconnect it and plug it back in (reboot) in order to unfreeze it, this has happened a handful of times. Maybe the'll have a firmware update to fix this issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "TH"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We are very happy with the results of having installed the fire stick.

It gets really agitating to have to continue to start the show your watching back over again. It was easy to install and start. At first the control went crazy and wouldn't stop going, going, going. I changed the batteries it quit running alone.
