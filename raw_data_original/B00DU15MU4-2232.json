Super easy and my Amazon was instantly there!! Super fast Netflix download and this thing is amazing fun!! All those Prime movie choices are awesome! I was a little disappointed that Prime membership is going up but I think between the free shipping and all those movies and tv shows available it still is worth the membership for sure!! Amazon keeps delivering one great product after another!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bikergirl"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I've owned the fire tv for a month now.  It has one HUGE downfall.  It eats GB like crazy... even while \"sleeping\".  I have 6 devices connected to my 250gb/month wifi plan.  Prior to purchasing the fire tv we used 60-70gb per month.  Our typical usage hasn't changed.  In the first 15 days we owned it we hit 80% usage of our 250gb plan.  I figured I must have left it on (and not let it go to \"sleep\") and it was a fluke.  Then we started our next billing cycle.  In the first 13 days we hit 82% usage.  I had been making sure the device was going to \"sleep\", ie the white light was turning off.  I called into customer service and was told that even when the device is sleeping it is constantly searching for all sorts of updates.  I was instructed to unplug the fire tv's power cord as that is the only way to truly turn the device off.  That's pretty convenient.  Lets make a device that is constantly searching for info and thus eating through your limited wifi data plan like crazy and make it so the only way you can stop this is to unplug the power cord.  Brilliant.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I've had the Fire TV now for over three months. Shipping was fast and free. Once set-up, the Amazon portion of the product works fine and the voice search is elegant and efficient; however, it only returns results from Amazon, effectively cutting its usefulness into a silly fraction. Should you want to search the Fire TV YouTube app, be prepared for the worst single-line no-wrap search menu I've ever experienced. Netflix is nearly useless through Fire TV as well. A recent \"update\" to the app has actually caused it to work less and less. I'm no statistician, but I'm guessing most people everywhere all the time use Netflix above most other apps. Whether this is on Netflix to update their app for harmonious compatibility or not, Amazon should shoulder a bit of the responsibility for ensuring you receive a smooth-running app. As is, I'm considering a return, or if it's out of the return policy range, trashing it or selling it for a few bucks and going back to my crappy smart TV system. At least Netflix worked consistently there.UPDATE: As the product was long outside the return window, I sold it and took only a small loss. I'm now happily back to my Samsung SmartTV system and I've realized that I'm not really missing anything Fire TV had to offer. My old system has Amazon Prime available, and Netflix works consistently. In fact, the evening I disconnected the Amazon Fire TV (only after restarting it several times, unloading and reloading the Netflix app, and even resetting the device to factory settings three times and STILL getting Netflix errors on over 70% of attempts) and reconnected my old system, Netflix worked perfectly on my old system. Every feature I'd tried watching on Amazon Fire TV only to receive repeated error messages worked perfectly on my old smart system.If you didn't find this review helpful, please leave a comment or question. I'd be happy to answer it or make the review more helpful to your consideration for this purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "@theCryptKicker"}]
