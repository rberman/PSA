[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "The stick connected to my network, but was unable to connect to Amazon. My network is not the issue. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with two Amazon techs who didn't seen to know what to do. Then the phone line went dead--and they never called back. Very frustrating as I waited almost 6 weeks for it to arrive. Not sure what to do at this point...12/30 update: So it took their 2nd level support a week to figure out the next steps and reply to my email. They suggested I used my phone as a hotspot. When I did that, the Fire Stick was able to connect to Amazon and download a software update.  After that, I was able to successfully connect to my home network.  All seemed to be working well.  Then the Fire Stick lost connection with my network every 20-25 minutes.  This was a continual problem, and very annoying when trying to watch a movie.Long story short, the problem could not be resolved, even after sending a replacement device.  I expect the Fire Stick had connectivity issues with my router.  I was very surprised by the skills (or lack thereof) of the Amazon Fire tech support team.  All the first and 2nd level techs did was repeat the same steps over and over --> power down the device, unplug the router, etc. They really seemed to have no idea about what was going on.  After about 6 hours of wasted time, I decided to send it back for a refund.Unfortunate, because I really wanted to use this. When it did work, it was great. Time to buy an AppleTV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "8/10", "author": "S.R."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "So far, not very impressed. For the hardware this thing has, it should run a lot smoother. It is very choppy, with delays between button press on the remote and actual action on the screen. It also seems to need to buffer a lot. I had a Chromecast before and it actually worked better. I hope the Fire TV Stick is updated and improves because I do like being able to stream the Prime video.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Michelle H"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Amazon has done a good job by nicely packaging the product and presenting it to the user with a short video that introduces the main features, screens and options available. Next, when the device is ready for use, after it has linked to the WI-FI (user enabled access) and some necessary configurations, then the Main menu screen shows up and makes sense to the user right away.  Everything seems to be shown in Hi definition. That makes a big difference. Wii-Fi Access is user's equipment dependent, so I can't complain much about it. But, I wish I do not get the occasional freezes, like I do get sometimes. For the most part, I enjoy all the additional fun I have found by using this TV stick: Movies, TV programs, Apps and much more. I have kissed the cable company good bye for a long time already, and this device will make my entertaining time for fun every day. I hope one day, I will also get access to PBS, Aljazeera, and some local channels as well. I have CBS news for now, not bad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "eTech4Hire \"eTech\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I ordered this stick two months ago because Chromecast didn't support Showtime Anytime.  Since then, Google has added Showtime to their list of compatible services.  I figured I'd still get the Fire Stick and try it out because I have a Prime account (even though I can use my Xbox 360 to access Amazon).  I installed and tried to set up Showtime Anytime.  However, DirecTV isn't supported through this device.  The Amazon app claims that it's DirecTV's fault, but I can cast Showtime to my Chromecast using my DirecTV account.  Xfinity/Comcast is also listed on Showtime's site, but it's not listed as a valid provider through the Amazon app.  Apparently, Amazon doesn't want to support the top two cable/satellite providers in the United States.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Lawrence Lamb"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like the fact that I can use Netfilix, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus.  The only thing I do not like is the price of the videos that must be purchased when not available on the aforementioned providers.  Even old movies are over $3.00.  Don't see why a movie like Home Alone should cost more that a buck.On the plus side, it works very well and the remote is much more responsive than the one on my BluRay player .I can also use my smartphone as a remote complete with voice recognition commands.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark S.

Ordered two Amazon Fire Sticks. Figured I'd keep one and give the other as a present.The first.. was really tight in getting into and out of the HDMI jack. Once plugged in, I got the start up screen, and input my Hulu, Netflix, etc info. But there was flicker and static intermittently. Thought the stick might be loose or need a different cable. Nope. Same thing. Watched some shows on Hulu, and dealt with the flicker. Very annoying. From what I saw and played with, the picture quality (when it came in) was good (compared to AppleTV/Roku), and the interface was fine.This morning, I unplugged everything to move cables around, and the problem was now worse, but my Roku, blu-ray player, and DirecTV connections were fine. Alright, lets try the second stick...Same thing. If not worse. Just like the old days in trying to watch a far away station (Mars?) with rabbit ear antennae.Will try playing with the units again, but it's looking like I'm going to send them back. These two units may be a from a bad batch, but they're more headache than pleasure.UPDATE: I should mention that my studio/office TV is a Samsung with only one HDMI jack, and I use a Monoprice HDMI switcher to go from TV to blu/dvd to Roku. Maybe the FireTV Stick doesn't like the HDMI switcher? Or my Samsung TV? Everything else plays fine.This evening I jiggled the stick & cables a bit and was able to watch an episode of Constantine on Hulu, with only some glitches in the first few minutes of the episode. Then, I thought it was time to try the stick on the downstairs TV.The downstairs set is a older Panasonic plasma. I unplug the AppleTV and insert the FireTV stick (with extension. Without the extension, it was a bitch to get in (and I never did!) Even in the back of the set, and in the dark, I can plug the other stuff in, but not that Amazon stick! Anyway, it was in with the extension, and... nothing. No picture, no nothing. And yes, it was plugged into the power cord. OK, lets try a different HDMI jack. Same thing. Tight fit. Needs extension. And... Nothing. No picture.I'm confused. I give up. Let's just plug the Apple TV back in, 'cause, it just works.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "25/26", "author": "Bolshoi Kniga"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received this week.  It is easy to install and works great.  I also installed u-tube on it.  The only problem is the search is slow to use if you don't have something else to use.
