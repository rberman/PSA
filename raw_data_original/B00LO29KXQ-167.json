But for the money, the Fire TV Stick is the best media streamer on the market. It doesn't have the channel selection of the Roku, but if you subscribe to the big 4:Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and HBO...the TV Stick is the way to go.  The U.I. is faster and content loads almost instantly.  The Fire TV Stick has its own remote unlike the similarly priced (but functionally deficient) Chromecast. Plus, if you really need to play Android games on your TV, the TV Stick has a fairly healthy selection to choose from.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gary Lobaugh"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product for movies.
