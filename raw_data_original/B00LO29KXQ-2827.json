[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I loved this when I first got it. As a Chromecast user previously, I wanted 1. A way to watch my Prime videos, and 2. A remote that was fast and efficient (using my iPhone or iPad was far from efficient). That being said, the fire stick works well for AMAZON PRIME, but not as well on Hulu Plus or Netflix. When I watch programming on Hulu or Netflix, EVERY SINGLE TIME, video feed freezes, while audio continues. I have tried every fix suggested in the help section, and it STILL HAPPENS. Bottom line: if all you want is a way to watch Amazon Prime, buy this. As for me, I'm a disappointed customer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

Amazon did a good job in it's design.  It has a small footprint and works just as good as my Apple TVs in what I want it to do.Interface is nice and allows access to the various apps such as Hulu, Netflix, etc.  One of the features I like that this has over things like Chromecast is the remote(I didn't want to use my smartphone as the remote)The price point is also nice as it hit's that sweet spot to where you can buy 2 of these instead of 1 Fire TV or Apple TV.If you are in the market for an add-on to your TV, this is definitely a good way to go.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MSMJ Shaffer \"FMZ\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "\" LOVE IT \"", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "michael griffith"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gene"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome, its a movie saver when there is nothing to watch in cable T.V.
