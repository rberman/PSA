They have better Remotes and storage.  Otherwise they work the same.  If you want the voice search,  on the stick,  you just downloade The remote app.  But I think it's worth the money  to buy the full unit,  for your main viewing room then maybe the stick for a lesser used room or child's room.  I have the full unit in the bedroom as well.Some of the best things I like are being able to download apps that turn your TV into an aquarium  or TV.  Great for not having a black hole when the tv is off,  it also has its own screen saver with awesome pics which does the same or you can tell it to use your pics,  so you can use it as a family album when your not viewing TV.  Oh yeah,  very little buffering when using this.  If your watching Prime Videos,  buffering is almost non existing.  I love my fire TV and fire stick.  If the stick had the better remote,  I have rated 5 stars.  It's a GREAT beginners tool for streaming.

This means you can't login to the wifi unless you have a device with a screen and a keyboard where you can enter your room number and select what internet you want to buy or get for free. This is the first device that allows that.IMPORTANT: It DID NOT work when I first got it. I tried it at home and it worked great. It even downloaded the latest software but when I got to the hotel it did not work. What is supposed to happen when you select the hotel wifi is a browser window is supposed to open so you can enter your room number and purchase internet. That did not work. I took it home and I updated the software (you have to do this at home where it can connect to the internet without the captive portal). Once I did this it worked perfectly at hotels. Don't take its word for the fact that it updated software. Force it to do that at home.Now it works great. I plug it into an HDMI port on the TV (or on the furniture console in some hotels) and then I go to networks and select the correct hotel network. You have to be patient but eventually it will open a browser window where you can enter your name and room number and select internet. Once it is working, it will go for as long as you selected internet. Some hotels make you repurchase every 24 hours but that is not a problem. This gives you access to your Prime, netflix, hbo go and other content. Way cheaper than buying hotel movies with much more selection. Hotel TV is terrible and this makes it perfect. Remember not to leave it in hotel when you check out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "Dimi"}]
