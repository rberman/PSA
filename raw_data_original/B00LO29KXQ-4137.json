Opens an interface you've been waiting for. Only bad side is the remote. You practically have to smash it to get it open to insert batteries. In addition, no information tells you if you need to switch the usb back and forth with your cable or satellite.... You do!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "by Valerie Nixon"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Doesnt let you connect to wifi that need a password at a hotel, the whole reason whyi bought this thing is so i can travel and watch movies.

I have been able to cut my Satellite bill by 70% by dropping all but local channels, and maintaining my \"International\" package. That is including the few subscriptions that I need to match what I was getting previously. So I might be a week behind on some shows, it really doesn't matter to me as I always DVR'd most of them anyway and would watch when I had a chance. Lots of Apps to choose from, unlike with \"Cable or Satellite forcing their choices on you. So many networks now have their own free apps it makes it even a better buy. No glitches with it after a few months, bottom line...I am one happy camper with this purchase.Only con I have found so far is the remote's awkward way to search on some apps.

It's small. Big Deal. You still have to plug it into an outlet via a USB cable. It's not like you  just plug in the stick into your tv and you're set like most people think. No way. YOU STILL NEED TO PLUG IT INTO AN OUTLET.
