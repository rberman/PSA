Pixellated images and impromptu freeze frames while the feed catches up. And I'm not reading anything here about buffer capacity that might alleviate that. I even get that on HD broadcasts on the regular TV channels and I have to switch to the SD channels to continue watching. I've already tried Netfilx's streaming (my Blu-Ray player and my TiVo both can do streaming) and some movies have come through audio-only, so I gave that up. Whether you can have streaming at all is like that old sales clich\u00e9; it's all location location location.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "R. L.
