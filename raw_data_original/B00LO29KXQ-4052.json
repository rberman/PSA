I will keep it simple.Remote, very buggy, poor response.Wifi signal- set up in a room 10 feet from the wifi ACESS point. Signal goes from 3 bars ( full ) to 1 to lost connection to full strength. Using other devices in the same area to test possible inference, they work fine. iPhone 6 130-150mbs down using speed test app.I need this device for the slingbox. Will return and buy the more expensive box set, as for the stick, chrome, or Roku are the way to go in this price range.
