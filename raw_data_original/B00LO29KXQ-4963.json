I have chromecast, roku stick and now fire stick. Fire stick over all best quality. Roku menu is easier to use but that is the only negative.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tommie R. Scheible"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use. Fast to turn on and navigate through.

My internet modem is upstairs in a bedroom and is apparently too far away for a strong connection downstairs where I'd like to use the Stick. It's working great on my smaller HDTV upstairs, in the same room as the internet modem. If anyone has suggestions for correcting this issue, please let me know. But keep in mind that I can't move the modem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Liv Jackson \"SLJ\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Now I have a smart TV and loving it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.

Now it refuses to recognize any passwords - ones that it has been using for a week. When I reenter it seems unable to connect.. And as to portability, when I moved it from one set to another it lost all the apps and password info, so that's not worth the hassle. Good idea. Good price. But the technical execution seems pretty shoddy to me. I'd wait 6 months until they put a usable product out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pragmatist"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
