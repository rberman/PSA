Tried it over and over on my TV in Hawaii. Ordered a replacement - same problem, could not connect to wifi from the start. Brought the replacement back to NC and it worked as it was supposed to. However, it was still much slower than my Roku and the descriptions of the movies do not load until you click to select the video which is really really annoying. Overall it works, I've been using it since I'm too lazy to change it back over, I like that you don't have to see it since it's behind the tv. But I'm not getting rid of my Roku for this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jade"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Can't use it much because the grandkids have the PS# in the port.
