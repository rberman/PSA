Tried putting remote 2 inches from Fire TV Stick, using the HDMI extender, not using the HDMI extender. putting fresh batteries in, NOTHING.Edit:Amazon was going to send me a replacement, but at the last minute, I decided to try it out on the living room TV. It worked! Not sure if it was Bluetooth interference in the bedroom, but it works great in the living room. I have upgraded the rating to 4 stars. The interface works, if a little cluttered and the loading speeds are faster than loading similar apps on my PS3 or Xbox 360, plus it uses less electricity to just have the Fire TV Stick plugged in. Audio and Video quality are the same as those consoles. The ability to play basic android games is neat. Some games work on the Fire TV Stick Remote, but obviously you would get benefit (better controls) if you buy the Amazon BT Gaming Controller, or just use a BT one you have laying around.I haven't tested if a PS3 or Xbox 360 controller would sync to the Fire TV Stick.The stick does get hot after a while, and despite what the message said about not supplying enough power from the TV's USB, it has been working just fine the last 4 hours of testing. I haven't experienced any wifi connectivity issues either.This device has essentially turned my dumb TV into a SMART one!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cool Spot"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Was received as a gift.
