Plugged it into an available HDMI port on my Pioneer VSX-822-K A/V receiver and couldn't get away from the TV for hours!  Easy setup, nice interface.  My two unexpected surprises were Amazon Music - great to have access to all my music through the Fire TV Stick, and the Remote Control app for my phone - nice to have an alternative to the remote if needed.  I like the interface for Amazon Video--binge-watched 4 episodes of Falling Skies without having to touch the remote.  Dangerous!  I've got a Chromecast as well on another TV and this definitely compares favorably.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dan McElroy \"consumer\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Made my tv a smart tv for way cheap!
