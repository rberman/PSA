[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "The fire tv is ok, not that impressed.  It keeps bumping me off.  Even after getting a booster.  I brought this thinking I would get better service,  then I had gotten on my game system.  But I watch my other tv system more often, because I do not have to deal with interruptions.  I would love to know if I could get my money back.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "sean"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Needs an off switch -- batteries in remote drain with constant connection to wifi", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Gregory Robinson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is the fastest streaming box out there.

Getting out of Hulu and Netflix, for example, requires multiple clicks. And, I do miss being able to access our iTunes purchases, as well as seeing the recommended items (which were both available on Apple TV). One nice feature is that you can search by speaking into the microphone on the remote... however, this is only within Amazon Prime selections, and will not work if you want to search for a show in Netflix or Hulu.There are so many choices for programming within Amazon Fire, though, that these complaints seem minor in the end. We don't have cable, and because we have Amazon Fire, it isn't missed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "K.
