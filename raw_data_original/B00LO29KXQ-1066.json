[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like the  ease of use but the picture quality is bad.  The stick makes it  look like a soap opera with character's movements unnaturally smooth.  It's the soap opera effect.

The best online content access device for the tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon philo"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Way too much buffering. Netflix hardly ever works on the Fire Stick, however my kids Wii-u, that also plays Netflix, doesn't buffer anywhere NEAR as much. Constantly says no network connection, but when I check the other devices in my home, they're all connected. HBOgo may as well not be compatible because it freezes 90% of the time. Takes 30 extra min to watch a movie. The only thing that seems to work ok IS Amazon Library and Prime movies of course. Over all the stick has ok days, but it bad days out weigh the good days. I've been told the Fire TV is much better. MAy try my luck with it instead.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "theladyny"}]
