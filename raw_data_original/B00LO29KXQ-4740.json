The Kindle Fire Stick is easy to install and setup.  Takes just a few minutes.  I have 30MB internet download broadband speed with a 5G wireless connection going and it is working great for movies, shows, etc.  Easy to operate and the apps are great.  Highly recommend.

Customer service was so horrible had I been a first time Amazon customer I never would have bought anything from them again.  These units are defective.  I bought this before the holidays hoping to have an easy way to access Amazon Prime through my TV.  Wrong.  All you have to do is do a google search on Fire Stick doesn't work and you'll find plenty of customers who are probably too pissed off to bother writing a review.  I tried all the fixes suggested.  Finally I thought I would exchange it for one that worked (if that was even possible).  I got transferred  to 5 different people and was told to wait on hold by each of them... each one telling me they weren't authorized to exchange my product.  What a time sink!  Unless you're looking for a new hobby ... you should definitely pass on this unit!!!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Naomi B Duane"}]
