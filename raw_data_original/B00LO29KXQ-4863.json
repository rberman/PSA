Miracast is a wireless image streaming standard, advertising it in the product marketing gives the mistaken impression that it should work with other Miracast devices in the same manner that a WiFi certified device would be expected to work with other WiFi certified devices. Apparently not. Avoid this device if display mirroring is a useful feature you'd expect to use with a device like this, get a ChromeCast, Roku 3, Roku Stick or Apple TV instead, all have better display mirroring capabilities and cost about the same.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.
