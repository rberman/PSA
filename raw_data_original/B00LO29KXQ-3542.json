It works fine in a room close to the router,  but in the TV room at the other end of the house,  no go. It was the only WiFi device that does not work very well in that room. It admitted there was a strong WiFi signal - it just didn't want to connect. Now it's in a room where I didn't want it,  and I have a Roku stick that is functioning great where the Fire Stick wouldn't work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Just limited things to do with it at this time.

My only issue is that not all of the shows of some of the networks that are carried on this service are available.  and some are a season behind.  but there is lots of available content and we are enjoying watching many of the shows and movies.

If you are in the market for a basic upgrade to an older non-smart TV, these are well worth the investment.I would also like to see if they will work with computer monitors, so you can add an effective fast boot media option to your PC. Have not tested, but if I do, I will update. I see no reason why it would not work as long as your monitor has built in speakers. It would be cool if they added a 3.5mm line out for audio when used in such an application.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Godkast"}]
