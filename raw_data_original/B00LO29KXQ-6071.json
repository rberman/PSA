[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have a Roku 2 and I can say for sure the image quality is much better at the Roku than in the Fire Stick.  I am not sure why, but the video from the fire stick seems kind of 'washed out', not so sharp.The fire stick will also frozen in the middle of a video for no absolute reason. I thought using the fire stick for Amazon video, but I will stay with my Roku 2 for now....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "AA \"AAA\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I like this because it provides an easy way for me to access Prime Video and Prime Music. Other than that, I don't really see much benefit of this over the Chromecast or Roku. I do like that it doesn't tie up my tablet or phone in some situations like Chromecast does. But, sometimes I do want to sling something from my phone. The remote feels good, but I think Roku does the same thing and is probably more mature. Of course, Jeff B. locks down Amazon services enough, that you probably need this too if you are a Prime subscriber.My biggest negative is that this quadruples the boot time of my television. For some reason the Fire stick crashes my Visio television when I turn it on, reboots it, and then lets it start.... slowly. I haven't tried it on another television yet because I really only want the fire stick in one room of my house, but the interaction kind of sucks.Oh, and setting this thing up is horrible. Well, at least it was for me. It was a half hour of software install failures and incremental updates before I could even interact with the system.I got this for the $20 intro price, which it is worth. If I'd paid the $40 they are asking this would be a one or two star review.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

One of them never was able to install the mandatory update. The other worked, but needed to use the supplied power adapter and there is no AC outlet available for my wall mounted TV. Chromecast works from my TV USB supplied power. Location of the micro USB on the unit is on the side, so it was necessary to use the supplied HDMI extender. I did like the Android remote application something that the Nexus Player is lacking. The interface itself was okay, too much non Prime content. Having to weed through the non Prime content is just not worth the time and effort. If you buy/rent content from Amazon this device is probably for you. It is no way a Chromecast or Roku killer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "David Nettles"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very good device.

I just received the Fire stick today and for the past 2 hrs have been trying to get it to connect to my internet. Sometimes it would connect and then it would say, \"checking for software updates\" and it would take. literally, 10 min. and then either it times out or something and then says it has no connection and I have to retry ALL OVER again. Very frustrating!! Well, I'm not happy and glad I only paid $20 for it.***UPDATE**UPDATE**I have changed my mind about the previous review I made. I am pretty sure that my solution and problem, is the same as others that have been having issue with the Fire stick. As I described above, I could not get it to connect wit the internet and when it did it kept cutting off and then saying it couldn't connect to amazon, etc. I couldn't understand because my other internet things worked just fine but I did notice that when I tried to use my dvd player to see if it was connecting ok, it was in fact not and kept disconnecting. BUT, I had an idea. I moved my router and viola! Everything changed! While my smart dvd worked and my other things worked. Fire stick is a high bandwidth product and if you have weak internet, a place in your house where the internet is a little weak because of location, trees, interference, etc.You WILL have issues connecting with Fire stick and also, I found that if your router is a long distance away, around a corner, tucked away, it weakens its strength with certain internet enabled items; Fire stick being one of them. If you move your router either within the same general area, room, or an unobstructed area not more than 5ft away, then you should not have problems. Is that a pain? Kinda? Is it worth it to move it a little bit closer? I would say that is a definite yes. Now, that I have done that, my Fire stick works like a dream and we love it. I can barely get my kid to go to sleep at night because of all the stuff just for him he can watch; and I literally stayed awake til 5am watching movies! If you have some patience, and/or try moving the router closer, then you will love your Fire stick, too. I took off one star because really, should we have to do that? No. I hope that in the next upgrade, they will fix that issue. I hope that this helped someone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "S.

First, the fire stick actually connects to my WiFi and plays HD video from the other side of the house as my router. The Rokus for some reason always struggled to hold a strong connection and rarely played HD video from the same location.The speed in navigating menus and for videos to start playing blows all Rokus out of the water, even the latest Roku 3. The only thing I miss is the headphone jack on the Roku remote for night time listening.Miracast on the Fire TV stick was extremely easy to setup, clear, and lag free. Its a great feature but you can't multitask on your casting device while playing video like a Chromecast.The selection of available apps pails in comparison to the Roku channels availability. Major apps like Netflix and Hulu are there and HBO Go is coming soon. Its definitely enough to cover what I watch the most. Of course the Amazon Prime library is front and center. I have no problem with that as Amazon is already my go to movie rental service.Overall I love the Fire TV stick and prefer it over the available Rokus. I've never used a Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brandoshus"}]
