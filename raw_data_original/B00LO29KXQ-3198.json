[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am very pleased with this device.  Even though I love watching programs on my Kindle, I watch more movies and shows with this product - more even than I watch on my the television cable service.  It is wonderful to be able to watch series from pilot to end in my recliner rather than at the computer. Now I wish for Prime to provide more of Amazon's offerings.  It would be unfortunate if at the end of my first year of Prime I did not renew because there were not enough new shows and movies available.
