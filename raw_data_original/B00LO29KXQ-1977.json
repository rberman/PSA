[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like the idea behind Fire TV Stick better than the actual product. I wasted hours troubleshooting. Sometimes even the support people could not help me. Sometimes the cable company and Amazon support threw the ball at each others and I was on my own dealing with delays and settings and unable to load video when the connection was supposedly very good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jenny"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great, easy to install and use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mrs. Warren E.

It will not show videos streaming on my iPad or laptop on the video screen.  All I get is a few pixels and no audio.  Somewhere in the documentation it says \"experimental,\" which means they aren't sure if it will work or not.  It will not hold an internet connection.  It will show that I am connected, then when I play it says not connected.  This is worthless.  Either send me a new one that works, or give me my money back.  My wife bought the apple device and it works perfectly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steve Earley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "was a gift my Daughter loves this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "George"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to set up......plug in and follow onscreen prompts.....took me 2 mins and response with remote fast and better then blu ray response.
