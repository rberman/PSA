[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "We had been streaming Netflix through an old Wii and started looking at options. Received an email from Amazon offering the Fire TV on sale. GREAT device - super easy to set up and so much easier and less cumbersome to use than streaming through the Wii. Love the voice command feature - works great. Also love the 30 day free trial of Prime and will keep that going since there are some series on Amazon that aren't on Netflix - Justified being one. My only hesitation is they currently do not offer HBO GO but supposedly will by the end of the year.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brenda in TX"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Whole family loves it!Better than Apple TV!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Demetrios Drakos"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Can't seem to play arbitrary podcasts and apps not from amazon store don't appear on the apps screen.
