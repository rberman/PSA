I got my son a Chromecast for his birthday because he said he wanted one over the Fire TV Stick. HA! Now he will only watch my TV and never uses his cumbersome Chromecast. I love that the Fire TV Stick app remote is available for my tablet and phone because the remote is small and I keep losing it in the couch cushions. My son loves the games that are available on it and we all love having our Netflix and Hulu at our fingertips. It is way more responsive than the Chromecast or our blu-ray player.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mary Waldo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!
