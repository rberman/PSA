So far we like it but there are a couple things I wish they would improve.  Navigation is less than desirable.  It's very hard to find what you're looking for on there.  It isn't very intuitive.  Also, we haven't figured out a way to play a whole series of shows, one after the other.  Other than those two minor things (the last one may be user error), this thing is pretty sweet.  Netflix, Hulu, PBS Kids, and more are available.  The remote is nice a sleek looking too.  Works out great for what we wanted it for.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Becky"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great for easy access to online media.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "suzanne0305"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Thanks....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pcitllc"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my new Fire TV!
