[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I don't usually write reviews, but I thought I should since there are so many options when it comes to streaming. First, it hardly takes up any room and the set up is easy. I do not like a lot of cords around the back of the tv, this simply plugs into the HDMI port and the adapter plugs into the wall. I am pretty tech savvy but I prefer simplicity when I am hooking up things (don't we all!) I immediately started watching Netflix after everything was done. Everything has been a breeze. I've had it for about a month and I love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.

Prime music playlists are very good. Standard remote is not the best game controller, but I don't play many games anyway. I would like to see a YouTube option since they have some good shows too.
