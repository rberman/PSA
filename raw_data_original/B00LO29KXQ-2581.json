I also did not wish to keep moving my Play Station 3 between TV's. The Fire TV Stick works very well - sometimes it takes a bit to load content, but I think that is because I am using it in my bedroom which is furthest away from where the wireless router is hooked up. Great for watching Netflix and taking advantage of my Amazon Prime Instant Video subscriptions. No complaints so far - purchased around 2 weeks ago. Easy setup and easy to use - it truly did turn my TV into a \"SmartTV.\"", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ashlan Cabanilla"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It's still pretty limited in terms of apps, but I really like having the menu. I have the Fire Stick and Chromecast--I prefer the Fire Stick for browsing Netflix and Amazon Prime video (the latter being almost never given the limited selection), but Chromecast for everything else (Youtube, Pandora, HBO Go, Starz, Showtime, Encore, etc.). Because of the limited app selection for the Fire Stick I actually had to move it out of my main TV room in favor of the Chromecast. I bought it when it was on sale for $20, and I'd say it's worth that. Not worth much more until they get more apps supported.I cannot understand why I can use Comcast's HBO Go login for Chromecast but not the Fire Stick.
