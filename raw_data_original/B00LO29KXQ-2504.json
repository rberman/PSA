In some ways better than chromecast. I like having a physical remote. The ability to use my prime videos was key as well.

It's so affordable and has so many features. I was deciding between this and the Roku Stick and I went with Amazon because it has better specs for less. I could not be more satisfied right now.

What it does out of the box is already great but once you tap into side loading apps like showbox,HD cinema, kodi, and Firefox browser this really makes it amazing.  If you're a cable cutter then this is the route to go.
