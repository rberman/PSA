So far it has been nice to have.  Good price, too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joseph L Perkins"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you have Amazon Prime you should get this. First let me say that I do not have a newer smart TV with built in apps so this device works well for me.There aren't a lot of free A list movies  on Prime but I have watched a few older ones I missed in the theater. I have noticed the newer free Prime movies are the same as on EPIX.  The Stick has the NetFlix and Hulu apps so that should solve any TV or movie shortfalls. I don't have a subscription to either of these but I'm planning on it.A couple of apps I have used are The History Channel and PBS. These are great and have a lot of content. There are more content streaming apps that you can download and use but I haven't tried any of them yet.I buy my music through Amazon so having this available is great and it is better then hooking up my phone to speakers if I want to listen to a few songs.All things considered the Fire Sick is probably the same as similar devices so it comes down to where you're getting your content. Since I already have a Prime account and buy my music through Amazon this works for me.  And the few free movies I watched through Prime probably covered the price of the Fire Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joe H."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "simple to install, easier to use and cheaper than any other similar device. what's not to like?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joyce spaulding"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works exactly as advertised.

The fire tv stick immediately turned my television into a functional digital smart center with the addition of a few apps. The stick was simple to install and easy to navigate around the screen interface using the voice command feature of the Amazon Fire TV App that I downloaded through the IOS app store.
