Great interface as well.  As a bonus, if you download the \"Fire TV\" app, you can use voice searching through your phone, which works wonderfully.  The price can't be beat.  I will be purchasing a couple more of these to add to our other TVs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D. J.
