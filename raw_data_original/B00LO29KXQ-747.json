My  old Amazon fire tv did not last long.  I am using fire tv stick to watch Amazon movie and use Apple tv to watch netflex.  the apple tv is a year older.  It is still very easy to use.  The Amazon fire tv remote has problem.  We constantly has to unplug the wire to reset it.  Then the Fire tv remote is not working well either.  It seems the fire tv stick works better than the fire tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.

The set-up was surprisingly quick and simple. The menu/interface was also easy to navigate through using the supplied remote. While the Amazon Fire TV Stick can be controlled using a mobile app, I love having the remote as an additional option. Also, the specs of this product exceed that of its competitors'. With its dual-core processor and 8GB of storage, I have yet to experience any lag or connectivity issues. One minor con is that I had to connect an Amazon account with a linked credit/debit card before I could download any FREE apps but other than that, this product is amazing. The streaming quality is very clear and I love that I am able to screen mirror my device to the TV. The Amazon Fire TV Stick is a great product that offers awesome app/streaming features without the need of a Smart TV or gaming console.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephanie"}]
