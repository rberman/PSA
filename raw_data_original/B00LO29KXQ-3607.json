Then you only get it for 48 hours and if it a season you only get the first episode and you still have to purchase the rest. I do however enjoy the convenience of the fire stick..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul g.

The function is slower than my Chromecast which Amazon shows in a comparison to Roku, Firestick, and Chromecast. The only real plus I have to the stick is the use of my prime account for prime video.

I thought that the fee was exorbitant since I had already paid for the Plex app, but I begrudgingly paid the $5 fee.  This allowed me to watch my own video, but shortly thereafter, the Plex app asked me to pay the fee again.  Until this glitch gets resolved, the Fire TV stick has not met my expectations.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt"}]
