Then whamm, it went black, quit working.  So I am going with Roku 3.  It has 3 essential programs I have wanted on one device ; amazon, vudu, and Netflix.  My daughter just told me I could put my itune movies on usb then watch them on roku 3 until I can find easy AND cost effective way to watch my iTunes movies.  I gave the apple tv  4 stars because when it worked it was very wonderful, clear clean picture.

Unfortunately I purchased this item last year and received the model number :A1378 which is the 2nd generation.For the same price you can purchase the 3rd generation that is model number: A1427 or A1469.Double check the model number on the bottom of your Apple TV when you receive it to make sure you are receiving the latest model.
