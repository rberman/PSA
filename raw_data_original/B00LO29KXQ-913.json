Now every single time I start any video there is 2 mins of video, a lock up of the video while the audio keeps rolling and then the video catches up 30 seconds later. This is just an annoyance, but it means that this product wasn't ready for prime time when it was released. Also I get lock ups that kick me home fairly regularly and an inability to connect to the network occasionally when other devices are ok. I restart both and it works, but just another little annoyance to handle.I would think that the bigger Fire TV would handle the heat being generated better but maybe this is a software issue. I haven't found the perfect solution for streaming only, but my game consoles work flawlessly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paula"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great product great price", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "William Dennison"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Having some  trouble learning to use it, Do you have to be attached to a cable company to use completely?

I got the Fire stick free with Ooma phone service, and honestly didn't expect much difference in using it compared to the PS3, but, yeah, there were a lot of differences.  First, set-up was a breeze.  The stick comes with an extender that made it easy to reach those cramped HDMI ports on my TV.  The stick arrived already activated, and after a short video introduction, I was ready to go.  The remote control is one of my favorite things.  There are just a few buttons, laid out intuitively, and after just a couple of uses, it's easy to remember the button placement without looking at the remote each time.  If I'm watching cable, and want to switch over to the Fire stick, I just push any button on the remote, and Fire stick activates & automatically switches the TV input for me.  Rather than all the steps it took to switch to my PS3, just pressing one button takes me right to Amazon.  The ease of use, along with the top-quality sound & video make this a great device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Michael Vaughan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the ease of setup.

Limited written instructions and what was on the screen was in German. We had no idea how to change the language. Then there was a problem  with our password.

It worked well for a few months but then we kept getting error messages and were being kicked back to the home screen.  About one month later, it completely stopped working.  I was very disappointed that Amazon would make and sell such low quality.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Andrea"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great solution for households like my wife's relatives that want easy access to Netflix, HBO GO, etc. without the hassle and expense of an HTPC.Works right out of the box with little to no setup issues and is loads faster than the Roku Stick.
