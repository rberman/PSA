[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love how this works. Netflix has yet to \"bug out\" or gave me any kinds of problems. WiFi strength is ok in the basement where I have the TV setup and I have yet to have a buffering issue. The menu is easy to navigate. Watching Netflix on my TV rather than my iPad2 is well worth the $40. If you want to watch your streaming services on a television, this will handle all of you basic services.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cohort"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great.

We can take it with us on vacation and watch our Prime TV or HULUPlus etc.2.  It came with a remote - The remote is not really that great until you understand what the symbol's stand for.  Amazon should have put text by the symbols.  That would have made this a 5 star product for me, i give it 4.5 out of 5.3.  Got the app to voice search etc.  LOVE that!!4.  Even though all our TV's are samsung smart tvs the picture quality from fire stick is way better, very weird but I like that a lot.5.  Can stream...  love it.All in all I do love my Amazon Fire Stick and am so happy I bought it.

We used to use Chromecast but were tired of not being able to stream Amazon. I bought this at a lightning sale and am pleased with the purchase. I know that now 'n' days we all use our phone and tablets to control our TV's. This has the beauty of having both! You have a control or you can download the app for when your husband looses the remote! I think the only thing I miss about Chromecast is the beautiful scenic pictures they had. They were amazing. But my husband is happy with his control and my kids can watch Dora/Diego. So you have one happy momma!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Happy Family = Happy Mom"}]
