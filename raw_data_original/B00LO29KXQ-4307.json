I have owned a Roku 3 as my main streaming device for over a year now and and I love it. It works great, never has a buffering problem, and has an easy layout to navigate. In fact, before we cut the cord, it was on the secondary TV the Fire stick is on now. Never had a problem. Since I cut the cord completely a month ago, I needed a second streaming device. I tried the Roku stick but it was getting an 011 error that the company couldn't fix, so I took it back. Then I ordered the Fire TV stick. It finally showed up and while better than the Roku stick, it still has enough problems for me to return it.ProsPrice. $39. Much cheaper than a Roku 3Remote. The remote is sleek and small. Not as bulky as the Roku remotes.Portable. The size would make it easy to take on vacation or to a friend/relative's house.ConsBuffering issues. We tried on several occasion to watch shows via Hulu. The picture quality wasn't very good and very quickly the picture would stop while the sound continued. I tried both pausing the show and backing out of the app. Neither seemed to help.Lip Sync. On multiple occasions while watching Netflix, Hulu and Prime the voices and picture were off. I would have to back out of the app and try again. It usually fixed after the first try. Sometimes it would take 2 tries. If you would fast forward or reverse the problem would happen again.Picture. This is probably due to the signal strength, but I never thought the picture was as good as the Roku.I was really hoping this would be a cheap option for my needs. I bet in a month or two with a firmware update this will be a nice little streaming device. Unfortunately, for now, it's too problematic", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jack Burton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I freaking love this thing!

It sensed the network but would not recognize the password.  Amazon should make this known.
