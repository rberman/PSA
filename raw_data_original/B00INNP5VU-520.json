I have 2 other Rokus and this one may have very slightly improved the pic, but not enough to put up with the placement of the enter button below the scroll circle. Very aggravating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rose Anonymous"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This works great!!!  It delivers my Prime videos right on my TV.  I love this.
