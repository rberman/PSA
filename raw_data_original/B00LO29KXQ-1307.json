I am using it for prime and hbo Go, and as long as it has signal it seems to work okay.My biggest problem with this thing is that it's ability to pick up a WiFi signal sucks. I have a lot of devices connected via wifi with absolutely no problems....until I tried to connect this little guy. I put it on the TV I planned on using it with and installed a WiFi booster near it just to make sure. when doing the network setup, it detected my network with max bars for signal but then immediately disconnected...I retired this repeatedly during the setup with the same results. After I got frustrated with that, I brought it down to another TV about 3 feet from my router, only to experience the same issue for about 3 hours while trying different things and configurations on my router to get it to work, including changing the channel of my router to various channels in case there was some sort of interference that none of the other 9 wireless items near that TV were getting, but somehow the fire stick was (it should be noted that it would bounce back and forth from max signal to no signal repeatedly)...still the same problem with only a brief break where I could actually stream on it for 5 minutes with decent quality.Finally after changing and trying multiple things I finally took it back to the TV I originally started with and plugged in my wifi booster about 3 feet away, figuring what the hell I'll try it one more time on the TV I started with and if it doesn't work, return it....well for now it has worked with high quality for about 30 minutes (which is a record so far by a long shot). If all continues to go well I will leave this at three stars due to the fact it's nice when working, but caused me to blow my entire evening getting it to work. However, if it fails again like it was, I will be returning it and marking it down to 1 star which would be the most anything deserves that doesn't work as it should", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rob"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works well and fast shipment too!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott99"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Drops it's network connection roughly once every 2-3 hours requiring backing out to the main menu and resetting via the setting menu.
