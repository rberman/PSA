[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I was very excited about purchasing this device.  My family has lived overseas in Europe and now Japan for four years now.  We frequently purchase and rent from I Tunes with our Apple TV.  This was going to add games plus a choice in who to rent or buy from.  After setting up the device here is what I found.  First, I am unable to manually configure the DNS Subnet to use my UNBLOCKUS account.  This prevents me from accessing several features of the product.  Second, the device does not have the capability of serving more than one account with Amazon Prime.  Apple TV stores multiple accounts on one device.  Third I find it confusing that Amazon offers Unlimited Video for Prime Members and some Video is even marked Prime exclusives, but you still have to pay to watch.  On the pro side I do like the Game function.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/5", "author": "Psaicho"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I bought Amazon Fire TV a little more than a month ago and thought I would be thrilled with it but it has many issues. The main issues are it only displays videos sporadically (Prime and Hulu Plus videos) and it cuts out a lot when listening to music apps. There's no volume control or on-off button, which I wouldn't care but  spend so much time rebooting to try and make it work, all the unplugging and replugging has made me more aware that Amazon Fire TV is missing those basic features.The main troubleshooting directions provided is to plug and unplug or clear data and the cache, but none of it helps when it just suddenly decides to stop displaying video, though ads always seem to stream right through. I bought this instead of Chromecast because I am a huge Prime fan and was looking forward to seeing Prime videos on a bigger screen then my laptop, but that only happens occasionally.It's frustrating but I guess Amazon can't be perfect. My suggestion would be to wait until Amazon launches the next version and fixes some of the bugs before buying it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "11/15", "author": "Susan H."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Deserves 5 stars because it does exactly what it promised, and I already recommended it to most of my friends. I thought everything about the packaging was lovely, even the extra $39.99 you have to pay for a controller is decent because with the big gaming consoles theirs run like $60 now. I catch all of my favorites on Amazon video, especially Orphan Black. I am very impressed with the 1080p smooth playback, and I get no buffering like I do when Im on my Apple TV, which frustrates the hell out of me at times. I re-discovered Tetris on it, and the installation of other apps like XBMC is a God send. This is the best streamer out there hands down. The built-in microphone in the remote control works flawless, it does not bother me one bit that when I say what I want to watch it prompts me on the screen to make sure my choice is selected, all you do is hit the middle (select) button. So glad I took the plunge, if anyone wants to know anything about it just let me know.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Elizabeth A.

Remembers where you are in a series (e.g. Downton Abbey) and if you only watch part of something you can continue from where you stopped. I just love this thing. Only suggestion is to have a slightly larger remote with the buttons a little larger and further apart. Too easy in the dark to press \"Home\" instead of \"Pause\" which means you have to go find the program and pick up where you thought you paused.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MrDBS"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have Not found where to leave a review so someone can help me, I bought the fire TV and took it to Colombia, but as soon as I hook it up I find out that I can't see any of the streaming media, looks like it doesn't work because I am located in Colombia. It did no say that it couldn't be used somewhere else.

I was up and running with it in about five minuets. Looks great and packaging was well designed. Voice command is outstanding but wish it worked with Netfix and not just prime.
