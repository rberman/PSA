As with any other Apple product, it is beautifully designed and looks like it belongs wherever you place it.

We don't even have cable anymore, because why bother when you have this?! The only problem I have with my order was that the Apple TV doesn't come with the required HDMI cable - which is stupid! They don't even say anything when you order it that it won't come with the cord. I was so disappointed when I got it because it meant I couldn't set it up right away.Other than that, I love my Apple TV!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Ashley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My son bought this for me for fathers day and must say this is a great product.  We also purchased the wireless keyboard and this add even more to my enjoyment.  Easy set up and easy to install.  Except for sports does anyone watch live TV any more.  Only draw back is will not play Amazon but using my Ipad easy to mirror up to the big screen so no biggie.Big step up from using a blue ray player.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Ron Davis \"gravity003\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I purchased Apple TV because my old mini Mac finally got to the point where I could not upgrade it enough to stream video on Netflix.  I didn't really need a computer and didn't want to spend that kind of money, but I needed something to connect to my HDTV to stream video.This is what I like about Apple TV:1.  Easy to set up.  Just plug in the HDMI cable and go.  It picks up on the wifi immediately and I plugged my ethernet cable directly into it so it would run faster.2.  Picture quality is excellent.3. Easy to operate -- simple navigation and you can control it from your iPhone or iPad.  That is especially useful for the sites that you need to log into.  It's much faster to do it on the tablet or smartphone.Here is what I don't like about Apple TV:1. No Pandora2. No speakers. My Altec Lansing digital speakers cannot be connected to the Apple TV box nor does it recognize my Bose Soundlink bluetooth speaker.  This leaves me at the mercy of the speaker built into the TV.  I'm not sure how to connect external speakers to my TV so for the time being I just plugged them into the headphone jack, which helps but is not ideal.3.  I can't stream amazon video or music.  Yes, I know I could have purchased Fire TV but I figured it would be full of advertising like my Kindle Fire is.  So I opted for Apple.4. No web browser (this would solve the Pandora and amazon video problem.....)For $69 I can't complain.  It's much better than paying for cable or satellite TV.Once I figure out the speaker issue I will be a lot happier but for now I am satisfied.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"Dena\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "we freaking love this at home!!!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mar\u00eda de los Angeles"}]
