[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Overall, we are enjoying the item.  The main reason I bought it was to be able to watch Netflix, and unfortunately that does not work well at all.  The shows buffer far too much, the video locks up while the audio keeps going, and that throws the show out of sync for several minutes at a time. After I re-hooked up the Wii, Netflix works perfectly. So, it is not my tv or router or internet, etc. Also, cannot watch YouTube videos on it at all.  I had to by an app for $2.99 and use a different device to watch YouTube.  Not sure if there are issues with our Samsung TV, or if I just expected too much.  Those issues aside, which are major to me, we enjoy the Prime tv selection although there are a LOT of older movies or shows that I can't believe are not included for free.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Monica L.

My boyfriend installed it and he has trouble with buttering his bread. No problem. Navigating through the selections...no problem. We did have a little issues with the modem being slow and stopping the movie but it corrected itself after a while BUT I think it was my wi-fi connection not the Fire Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elizabeth H."}]
