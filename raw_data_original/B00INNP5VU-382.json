[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I previously owned the Roku 3 box and decided to return and get this version. I don't regret it. It is cheaper, smaller, and works the same way (performance-wise). Only difference is that the streaming stick remote does not support headphones, but I can live without it. Love the 4 dedicated buttons in the remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "YW"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "This Roku streaming stick wi-fi won't work unless it is very close to the router.  Don't order this if you aren't sure your wireless signal is strong enough.  Also is very slow.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mitchell \"Mitch\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This device is awesome!  I have a Roku 3 for the upstairs bedroom and purchased this streaming stick for the living room.  I wish I\u2019d gotten the stick for the bedroom; although the Roku 3 is small, this is practically invisible.The only negative is that I had to connect the power separately.  I know that some TVs can power it from their own USB port, but it would be nice to have this fact more prominent in the features/info, instead of just buried in the manual.  This negative, though, isn't enough to knock off a star.All in all, this performs perfectly well as a Roku device should.  Happily streaming Netflix, Hulu Plus, ESPN, etc. whenever I want.  With the Allcast app, I\u2019m even able to stream what I have stored in my Note 3 to the TV.Great purchase, highly recommended.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ender Wiggin"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Had to return, to many disconnects.
