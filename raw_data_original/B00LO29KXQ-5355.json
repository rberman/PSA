Beware, the firestick is a great idea, however, even though the Amazon prime membership is optional, I was under the impression I would have access to 200,000+ movies and tv shows, and you do, but, everything costs!!!! I watched a couple of WWII movies, 55 years old now, they still cost $4.99??? Exactly what does the $104 go for? This is really sad because I use Amazon all the time, and I'm generally very happy with everything I buy. I read the description repeatedly before buying this product, never did it say anywhere there were additional charges, NOWHERE! I'm also new to Netflix, which I also subscribed to, why is it you have to pay twice for that service too? Can someone please tell me how these marketing departments can get away with this?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "mark morgan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing things!
