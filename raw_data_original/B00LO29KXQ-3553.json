She doesn't know a lot about computers, so I had to set this up for her, and spend ~ an hour teaching her how to use it. She will be cancelling her cable tv soon, saving over $100/month (she signed up for netflix/prime/hulu already, after a short trial).Using a smart phone with this really makes the mic'd remote unnecessary, so don't worry about getting it if you have a decent phone. If you don't have a decent phone, the upgraded remote might be worth it due to the terrible on-screen typing system that *everyone* uses =P", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven Worcester"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "At first impression - I LOVED the new Fire TV Stick.But, it has lost its luster after \"forgetting\" my login info many times, including the login info for the Wifi network - VERY ANNOYING!I have mainly switched back to using my CAT5 Wired Apple TV because there are no issues with \"buffering\" when you are on a hard wired cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Was easy to install.
