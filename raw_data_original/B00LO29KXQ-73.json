[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I have owned and enjoyed an Amazon Fire TV for some time. It is a great product. Much more responsive than the Roku 2 XS box I also own. I tried to order another Amazon Fire TV to replace the Roku box. Amazon does not sell the Amazon Fire TV so the only choice was the Amazon Fire TV Stick.  I received it and it works but is much slower than the Amazon Fire TV - it is pokey compared to the real thing. Part of the problem is the slower processor in the stick and the complete lack of a wired Ethernet connector on the stick. They also cheapened the remote control by removing the voice input function. I have switched to the Roku 3 since Amazon has stopped making the real thing - the Amazon Fire TV. The only good thing I can say about the Amazon Fire TV Stick is the fact that it is cheap - so cheap in fact that I  am not even going to bother returning it. The new Apple TV also looks good so you  might want to hold  off until you take a look at it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thomas Doyle"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Netflix works great! So does screen mirroring. Crackle not so much, has a lot of ads and sometimes does not reload the movie or show that im watching. Other than crackle sucking.
