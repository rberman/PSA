I did an update and everything was fine after that. Amazon should instruct consumers to update immediately after installation. My Lg 3d tv does not have HBOGO or Showtimeanytime and they will never support those apps. I got tired of plugging my computer into my tv all the time so I decided to purchase this. Netflix lags sometimes and crashes but it is no different than when I use the app on my tv. No other apps do this so I am assuming it is a Netflix issue. I am happy with it...definitely a must if you have Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Suz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "As advertised.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chad"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dudley Fontenot \"Dudley Fontenot\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works really well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "PIsenhour"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A month ago I wasted my money on Chromecast.
