Unfortunately, it doesn't work with my Blackberry Q10 phone. This problem is discussed at length on Blackberry user forums, and everyone who has tried to make it work reports that both Amazon and RIM point the finger and say it's the other company's fault. Compare this with playing content from my iPhone to my Apple TV. It just works. There's something to be said for proprietary standards (though, really, not much).I don't really know or care whose fault it is; I just want it to work. And nobody is doing anything about it (at least nothing visible, yet). Fortunately, the Fire TV Stick does enough other things well that the miracast problem is a minor inconvenience, not a show stopper.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "xgrep \"xgrep\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best thing since homemade fried chicken!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "brelen kanaly"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I read a number of reviews that mentioned this device having a weak wifi connection.

The positives are that it is very easy to setup and has everything I expected in terms of apps. It's laid out well. Mich better than the Rokus we have on other TVs. The problems are all network related. I bypassed my main TVs built in streaming services because they were painfully slow to load. The Stick has all the same services but it CONSTANTLY disconnects from the internet. It is right next to my wifi. Less than a foot away and still I can't get through a single show without having to reset it. I gave up and went back to the TVs interface. I hope they can fix it. I was one of the prepaid customers and I really looked forward to it but I'm very disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Josh"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "OMG!
