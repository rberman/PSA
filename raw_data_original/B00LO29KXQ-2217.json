This alleviates the cord and the laptop and gives numerous other programs.  It does require the use of an HSB port or wall outlet to get power even with several new TV models but not a big deal ...

It was very easy setup.  Also I notice a much quicker load time for starting shows on Netflix and Hulu.  The fact its using RF instead if IR is also a plus as with Roku I had to make sure I had a good line of site.  This wasn't always possible unless I was sitting in certain spot in my living room.  It gives an amazing picture in 1080, which the Roku was only doing 720 or sometimes 480 it seemed.  If you don't need all the bells and whistles that the bigger units have this is the perfect device especially for the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aaron"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I look at it almost every day", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael Clark"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great device.
