[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This fire stick is sooo awesome. I like the fact that it is small and no assembly required.  Since this was for self use it was already programed for my prime account. All I had to do was plug the device into my tv, put the battery and I was ready to rock.  I like the fact that it is so easy to use. I also like that through this device I can access my Netflix account and stream no just on my computer but now tv as well.  The prime content on the tv is much better then on my laptop.  If you are on the fence, go for it.  This is a cheap purchase with so many benefits.
