Although running wireless, streamed films load/start very quickly and I don't get distracting \"buffering\" interruptions.  I only use this for Amazon Prime as I do Not have Hulu, nor NetFlix,Pandora, etc...On the negative side: - I don't like how the HDMI dongle has to be be plugged into the wall for power all the time -it's already crowded back there - The remote isn't always responsive -requiring several presses and sometimes it buffers the clicks so it goes way past the desired place. - Only supports Miracast for device mirroring/broadcasting -which for an Apple household is a non-starter", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "W.

Would have thought they had more features. Had to spend more money to get Hulu and netflix. Its a shame but what can you do?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amanda"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This device is awesome.  I bought it for $20 during the promo period.  I'd buy it for $40 if I had to.  The Fire TV interface is snappy and really easy to navigate.  I was actually surprised because I figured it would be clunky since it's just a stick dongle.  It's not, at all.  It's smooth and easy to use.  If you don't have prime it's probably rather useless though.  But Prime is worth it anyways.  Plenty of apps.  Easy to get to the amazon prime movies and shows.  Picture quality is great and the playback features are flawless.  I'm not sure what the complaints are about the lagging and choppy video....I'd assume those are related to their wifi or a lemon.  I bought this for the bedroom tv but we've taken it from the bedroom to the living room.  Set up is a snap and it's super easy to move.  The voice search app you can put on your phone is pretty sweet.  I like to use my phone as the controller more than the actual controller, but that's nice too.  Just an all-around good product.  I had thought about buying a roku for years, but I had some reservations.  Glad I finally pulled the trigger on this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GamerGuy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love tech, own a ton of gadgets, this is the best tech yet.  I actually have chromecast, a generic mirrorcastor, and android PCTV.  I also own a ton of other tech, so i feel my collection offers a good review of this product.I found it to be easy to use, it was pre-setup with my account, and the menu's are quick.  It has the fastest menu (unless its installing an app) of any device i have (chromecast doesn't have a menu).  It has the fastest streaming of movies and mirroring of android devices.  It looks the best on screen.  It has an app you can download to use with voice search (don't buy the voice remote).  You can pair it with any bluetooth joystick (don't buy the amazon one) to play games.  It allows a great selection of games.There really are no cons for me at this moment.  Just an amazing product.  Crazy that a device more powerful than chromecast and Roku combined is smaller than both.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

I like it better then Chromecast because it needs no other device. It's also fast with no buffering on video. Has a more open platform then Roku. I have all three devices, I still like Roku for number a channels. I got the fire for $24 so can't beat the price and quality. Set up is a little longer because of signing in again & again.....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "T.
