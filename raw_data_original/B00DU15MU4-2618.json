It was easy to set up and the WiFi works perfect with it. It took only about 5-10 minutes to set up the Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. My only complaint is that when I purchased this for him I received a $15 credit to use on Prime movies and wanted him to have it since he is th Prime membership holder and he was unable to do so. Not sure why. This is a going to give the Apple TV which we also have great competition. This works a lot faster than the Apple TV ever has in our house.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So, my bill for TV, Internet and phone was $190 a month--with no TV, the bill is now $55.  That's amazing!  I use Hulu Plus for $8 a month and share that with a friend who shares Netflix with me.  Betweene the two subscriptions, I've got all I can ask for.  I'm not much of a TV watcher--I don't have \"my shows\" and so this was realy a no-brainer for me.  I get my news on the computer and can watch series and movies whenever I like with Hulu ot Netflix.The only down side is that we can't access live sports", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carrie"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "REALLY disappointed with Prime choices - ie: paying for movies that have past theater - HBO/Showtime and have been on television.
