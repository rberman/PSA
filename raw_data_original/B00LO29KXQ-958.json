I'm a big fan of streaming media boxes. I mainly use the android Minix box but when Amazon had a sale I couldn't help but try the fire stick out for a streaming solution for the bedroom tv. I'm very glad I did. This is an excellent streamer. It's very fast. I've been able to side load applications that I like to use as well as Netflix and others. Everything I throw at it works perfectly. Even the remote control feels well build and quality. Amazon has earned my respect as a solution for quality streaming boxes. If this stick is this good I can't imagine how awesome the fire tv box is!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Travis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's great, does everything as expected and worth the price. Was a bit disappointed it needed to be within a range of about 3 metres from my modem to properly work. That said, connecting to my Netflix and HBO GO account with ease and now I can flip my TV's input over to it and in mere seconds I'm watching my favourite shows.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Sarkames"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "works good but still a lot of dumb movies !!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Daniel A.

They fail to mention it isn't as pictured like a zip drive that can be plugged in to a T.V., thus avoiding a long cord like the HDMI plug.  I can stream shows easier and there is a better connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mark Drake"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to use.

I have played with a ROKU owned multiple Apple TV first generation, multiple Apple TV second generation and a third generation Apple TV.  I was so impressed with the functionality and capability of these machines that I have since sold all of my Apple TVs.  Everything from the remote to the on screen performance is phenomenal.  I did have a small issue with one of the remotes connecting, however after less than 2 minutes and a reboot it synced up and have had no problems.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "jal9626"}]
