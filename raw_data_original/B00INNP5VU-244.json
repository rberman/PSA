At the time we bought it, our internet was only providing us with 3mb per second streaming, and I was advised that a 1080p would pause and buffer frequently. Now that we have been upgraded to 16mb per second, we opted for this.  Set-up was fairly quick and easy. You still have to enter some info so the new unit can communicate with your modem/router, but in no time we were watching 1080p Netflix and Amazon Prime movies and shows. The price is right, and it has been working reliably for a quite a few months now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "smart consumer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE this! it was so easy to set up!
