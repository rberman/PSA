[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "If zero stars were an option, that's exactly what this product would've/should've received. After 3 Fire sticks, we're sticking/stuck with cable as the sticks just don't want to work for more than 1 week, 2 days and 2 hours respectively. Maybe version 2.0 will actually allow me to \"cut the cord\", but the Fire stick simply isn't ready to be sold to anyone not willing to be Beta testers and that's not me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lynn Prenat"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works great !
