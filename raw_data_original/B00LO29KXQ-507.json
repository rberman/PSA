[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love being able to use Prime Video and Netflix through the Fire Stick. The interface is great and easy to use.The only problem I am having (which I haven't check to see if there is a fix yet) is that it sometimes drops the network connection in the middle of streaming and needs to be reset.

I had intended to switch it between my grandkids' bedrooms but it was easier to buy one for each than to try to get it to recognize wifi every time I moved it. I also have the box version and it works perfectly every time no matter where I hook it up. The wifi reception on the Stick is much weaker and less reliable than the box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LaDeeDa"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This product is amazing if you come strong use instructions to set up an hours of enjoyment I will recommend it to all my friends I'm also thinking of purchasing another one For my bedroom", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "peradise serv."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome, better than advertised!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nate"}]
