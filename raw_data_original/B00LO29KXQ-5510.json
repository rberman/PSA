[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I was a bit nervous after reading reviews of the Fire TV Stick not working on some TVs - but I was worrying for nothing.This was so easy to set up. I am completely non tech-savvy -  and bought my TV in 2007 - but this was very easy to set up. Just connect the stick to the power cord and to the TV  (had to dig out my TV manual to find the HTMI port) and then switch the source.It took a couple of tries for it to connect to the wi-fi but then everything was easy. I was able to easily connect to my Netflix account as well.I will do another review after i have played around with it a bit more - but I am very pleased so far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "English Mary"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great piece of electronics.

My device is located about 8 feet from my WiFi router, yet it constantly loses the connection. Some have suggested uninstalling any new apps, but that didn't help.  Restarting the device does help, but having to restart it several times a day is, to me, unacceptable.On the plus side - I love the user interface, and the streaming quality is fantastic.  I own a Roku, a Chromecast and a PS3 and I prefer streaming over the FireTV Stick to all of them - when it's working.If a firmware upgrade could take care of the bugs, I would gladly update my rating to 5 stars.  As it stands, I have to stick with 3.***UPDATE 7/20/2015***The stick has gotten much worse in the last few weeks. The network connection continues to drop, and many apps - like Watch Disney - are useless. I purchased another Roku today to feed my streaming habit.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BigDad5150 \"BigDad5150\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I would suggest getting the Fire TV stick over the Chromecast or Roku TV stick (especially if you are a prime member since it ties in prime instant video, music and photos).

Seluja"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I've never owned the Fire TV box but I have owned several other streaming devices. The Fire TV stick is a strong competitor amongst the others (mainly Chromecast and Roku). The picture quality is truly 1080p - crystal clear wifi streaming.PRO #1: The setup is so easy a 5 yr. old could do it.PRO #3: Very fast interface...other competitors interfaces moved slower.PRO #4: Price cannot be beat.PRO #5: I left the main menu on and left the room for a few minutes just to come back to a stunning - life like - screen saver on the screen. Awesome feature. So much better than the other whose screensaver is their logo - blah boring!CON #1 -  The USB cord that comes with it is on the short side and may be a problem for some whose televisions aren't within 2 - 3 feet of a power outlet. Even the extension they include is super short - not much of an extension at all actually. Solution to this would be to purchase an Amazon mini-USB cord that will reach from your Fire Stick to your electrical outlet (about $5).CON #2 - The ability to mirror Ipad or Iphone is not available. Only available through Miracast which is on Android only. Really wish I could mirror my iPhone but not a deal breaker for me as this feature is coming soon to IOS - how soon - don't know - but at least it's in the  works.OVERALL the Fire Stick is slightly better than other streaming sticks available on the market. The price is what makes this stick a firm competitor. Why pay more!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S. Steele"}]
