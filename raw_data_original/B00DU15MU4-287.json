I have experienced a repeated problem with Prime and Netflix videos becoming disconnected and going to a white screen and buzz. The only way to reconnect is to disconnect the power supply and reset the unit. It works fine for awhile and then disconnects again. I never experienced this problem with my old Roku unit. I have contacted Amazon by e-mail. They get back to me and say they can do nothing that I need to call them. Twice this evening I have called. The first time I waited over 20 minutes and nothing was resolved so I got tired of waiting and hung up. The second time I waited over 30 minutes and nothing was resolved, but person indicated that they need to refer it to \"software\" and promised to get back to me. At this point I have no confidence in this product or Amazon's customer service.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "jkotovsky \"jkotovsky\""}]
