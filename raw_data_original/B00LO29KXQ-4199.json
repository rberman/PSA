The big problems i have  are too short of a wall adapter cord for the usb power, a glitchy remote that sometimes jumps through 2, 3 or many selections when you are trying to advance one at a time, some of the apps only have a smaller selection of the content that you can view online on the web page (for example pbs and pbs kids) and last you are not able to add selections to my list in a child's profile on netflix. Those are all somewhat minor inconveniences so i still rate the firestick highly.
