I was excited to see Fire TV Stick and ordered on the first day it was announced. $20 was a no-brainer. My primary need for this was to use it with its parental controls enabled so kids could enjoy Amazon Instant Video / FreeTime.To my surprise, FreeTime app is nowhere to be found here. I was expecting it to have the same apps that the Fire TV does so this was rather disappointing.Next, I tried setting up the parental controls. The set up works fine but the execution of parental controls is woefully flawed. When it prompts you to enter your PIN for parental controls, the numbers can be easily read and memorized by kids because of the huge number pad visible on the screen. So it defeats the purpose of a parental lock when you have to inadvertently reveal the secret code to the kids. I used the Fire TV app on my Nexus 5, thinking that because I'm entering the PIN using my phone, it should not display the digits on the TV screen. No, it still FAILS MISERABLY when it comes to parental controls. There is no option to disable the feedback it gives showing each digit that you enter.Let's say that you do ask your kids to not look when you are typing the PIN, the way parental control works is still ridiculous. I wish it had the options to enable contents based on rating so I could block everything that was not rated G or PG. But I cannot. For every movie or TV show (including those for kids, rated G or TV-G), you MUST enter the PIN if you have parental controls enabled. When you enter the PIN so many times in front of kids, it's natural for them to memorize it, unless your child is so young (under 3) that they have yet to figure out numbers.So I thought that I would disable parental controls because it was useless. But I wanted to still lock it when purchasing apps or renting/buying content. It turns out that you cannot do that either. You must first enable parental controls to enable PIN-lock for contents.I only bought it for kids and since it cannot do basic parental controls, it is very much useless for me. I'm glad I only spent $20 on it.  I am hoping that Amazon gets this feedback to improve it in the next software update.\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592 UPDATE 04/14/2015 \u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592\u2592Amazon just released a software update (Fire OS Update 1.5) for Fire TV and Fire TV Stick that addresses the visible PIN issue. THANK YOU AMAZON!! I'm raising the rating for this product (4 stars). I'll update this review if Amazon finally offers FreeTime app with the Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/7", "author": "John Smith"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Super easy to setup.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Tony Smith"}]
