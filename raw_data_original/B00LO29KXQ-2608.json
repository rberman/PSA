The device is compact, though still very thick, which can be awkward to connect directly to your TV if you are using your other HDMI inputs. Fortunately it comes with an extension cord that solves that. The remote is also very sleek and useful.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jorge Villalobos \"Metal fan\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Firestick!

Outstanding usability with the simple pushbutton remote and excellent video and audio quality.
