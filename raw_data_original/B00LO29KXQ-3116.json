[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I bought the Fire Stick as an attempt to have access to material I couldn't get through my regular cable provider. So far, the feed is choppy, channels that were promised are not visible or available, and you can't turn the thing off when you are done. I wanted streaming but not 24/7 as I have some other things to do with my life besides watching TV. We couldn't even get the instructional video to play completely. I may be returning it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jkpscrap"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Product arrived on time and was easy to set up just plug it in and follow the on screen directions.

My problem I have is you ask for reviews before I've had a chance to use product long enough to get a better feel for how it does work and how well I like it.

It's easy to install, easy to use, and with Prime gives me a world of entertainment at no additional cost - or at occasional low cost for special things like Net-Flex offerings.  All this on my great big LED TV. Now I only use broadcast television with my Internet.  With this Stick I don't have any use for cable TV.

It does everything it's advertised to do quickly. I have an Apple TV as well, but I think I would prefer using the Fire Stick over it. Plus, you can't beat the price and small size of the device.

Since you can access Netflix through the Fire TV Stick there is literally too much to watch. Obviously there are lots of programs and movies you cannot watch through either of these services which  is why this is a great product and not a perfect product. The included remote is not needed since you can use your smart phone but I always use it because it is simple and works great. But when I do lose the remote I'm glad I can use my phone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eddie Rodriguez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the fire stick so far.
