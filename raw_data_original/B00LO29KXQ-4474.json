It uses your TV's HDMI port, not the USB.  I also have the Amazon Fire box for my other TV.  The Fire Stick remote does not have the voice command capability, but if you have a smartphone you can download the Fire TV app and use the app for the voice command.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to pay less than $40 for the ability to access Amazon Video, Netflix, Hulu, etc., but if money isn't an object, go with the Fire TV box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JULIE D GLEDHILL"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to use-love,love,love!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dona carr"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Waiting for it to get HBO Go compatibility, but otherwise, seems to work really well!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matthew"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "excellent", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bobby bland"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use, works as expected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephen Philbrick"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great I would have given it 5 stars if I could have brought the amazon screen up for viewing and buying off of amazon in the firestick programs", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "scotty"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fire stick is working out great!

The Stick is by far the choice for anyone looking to add smart TV functionality with 1080P to their TV.
