First off Amazon is using false advertisement in their image of the product. The stick must be used in conjunction with an HDMI cord that must go from the stick to an electrical wall adapter and the adapter design takes up two outlet spots. They make it look simple like say the Roku but it is far from that. Also in their design flaw where the HDMI cord plugs into the stick is on the side instead of on the end so if you have another device next to it you will have to use the jumper provided between the stick and your HDMI port. design flaws aside, the thing did nothing after installed, yeah nothing. It must not be plug and play because it didn't work at all. I have used Roku for years, that is a great product and perfected, this thing is literally garbage.
