Compared to devices like the Roku, Amazon's app selection is pitifully small, nor do they offer anything exclusive that you can't get on other (much cheaper) box top sets.Is speed better?  Yes it is, but not by the huge amount that you would think. On average, the FireTV starts movies/shows about 3 to 5 seconds faster than my Roku does.  That's not a lot of time saving for a device that costs twice as much.I do like the games on here better than the games on my Roku, but games take a LONG time to load - so there's a trade off with that as well.Ideally, Amazon should have waited six months and had a much huger selection of apps before they released this to the public. After three weeks of owning my Fire, Amazon hasn't added new apps the way I hoped they would. The Roku releases dozens of new apps per month, but it looks like the Fire is going to be more like the XBox One or PS4 - releasing only one or two apps in that period.So, technology-wise, there's nothing wrong with this product - but there ARE better options out there for the consumer.  There's nothing really new or innovative (the voice command thing isn't as impressive as Amazon would have you think - and it doesn't work on Netflix) here.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/7", "author": "Shannon T.

It is very easy to use for the technically challenged and it doesn't have all the little glitches other set-top boxes have.  It plays prime content like a dream.  The last two stars are for the lack of basic apps to make it a smart home appliance. The lack of a basic browser is a serious limitation.
