[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I absolutely LOVE my Fire TV Stick.  I haven't had any problems with loading or buffering, like I do on my laptop and now my laptop and tablet are free for me to use while I'm watching something on TV.  Plus now I use my Netflix and HuluPlus accounts more often because it's more convenient.
