[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have been a rough owner for years. Recently decided to purchase the Fire TV stuck since one of my rokus broke down. The stick was on sale for $34 so I said to myself \"what's the worst that can happen?, it don't work\"Well I've had it for about 3 weeks now and love it. The Fire Stick is similar to the rokus, but with better performance. Since using the Fire Stick I have NOT experienced any lag or frame freezing, the quality of video output is 1080p I and it's the size of a small memory stick. I give it an A+. The only minor dislike is that it has to be plugged into power outlet, but not a big issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marsha Cavin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing...
