It is zipline fast, incorporates the apps that are of interest to me (Netflix, PBS, Gaiam TV, etc.), as well as Amazon video. Takes up little space, easy to set up. It's a gem. And, though I thought that anything marketed with Gary Busey's craziness couldn't be functional or worth much, the voice search is fast and accurate. I'm not a channel surfer, and I like being able to find and select what interests me most, quickly. This does it, either by voice (the Amazon library), or via text (for all the apps).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joanne \"Fan of mostly non-fiction, mostly biographies, autobiographies and histories.\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ann F.
