My Lg 3d tv does not have HBOGO or Showtimeanytime and they will never support those apps. I got tired of plugging my computer into my tv all the time so I decided to purchase this.

I am happy with it...definitely a must if you have Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Suz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "As advertised.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chad"}]
