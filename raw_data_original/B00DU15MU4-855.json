[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great set top box. Runs XBMC/Kodi better than any android box I've owned, including the Minix Neo X8. Silent, doesn't run warm. Kodi+Plex make this the perfect home theater companion. Also runs Netflix and Amazon Instant video very well for other members of the family who don't know how to use Kodi. Remote clicks are fast and intuitive. Highly recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nicolette"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Seems to work quite well.
