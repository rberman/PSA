Believe it or not tried every configuration to correct audio and video issues tried dedicated sound system optical cables different hdmi cables different tvs diferent outlets even diferent homes same result of audio distortion. Forgot to mention the various factory resets various audio settings changed on TV and fire TV diferent power outlets, strips, surge, no surge, voltage stabilizer. Amazon tech support pulled info twice from unit could find nothing wrong. before you think it may be cables I have tried 4 diferent televisions which are compatible according to Amazon 6 diferent hdmi cables from diferent manufacturers all diferent lengths 3 diferent optical audio cables and 3 diferent stereo systems. My original roku hd  player manufactured in 2010 works flawlessly  My advice if you have a streaming player already pass on the fire tv", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "User45897"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Started out as a great idea until the fine print comes into play.  The setup was quick and easy and the welcome screen was very informative.  However, that is were the fun ended.  If you are only interested in getting the basic apps found on the Fire you find those on any smart TV or blue-ray player.  If you are on Comcast and want HBOgo you can forget it, the Fire does not support that cable provider.  If you want HBOgo alone forget that too, you cannot get it unless you subscribe to SnapTV.  This is where the fine print comes in.  To get SnapTV requires an up front three month payment, after that it is renewable every month.  Then you can add on HBOgo for an additional fee per month.  In the end you end up paying another hundred bucks or so up front just to get a premium service.So for a hundred dollars you can get the Fire, for another hundred you get SnapTV and HBOgo for three months, then your paying around 50 bucks a month for a single premium channel and some add on basic cable channels.  Oh and any extra channels you may like on SnapTV will run you another 5 dollars per channel as well.  In short you can quickly be paying the same for the Fire and its channels as you would with any Cable provider.  But you do get a cool voice control remote as a bonus.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/4", "author": "Ster"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent value; better than I expected and relatively easy to set up and use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thomas J. Goodall"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice gizmo. Easy setup and free games and apps are easy to download. Missing a key piece which is the power button or ability to turn it off -- others have noted this. The mic is okay, I've used it for about 3 tries. it's just easier to use the navigation to get what I need. I thought my kids would love the Mic but they seem to like using the navigation as well. What's important is the UI is good so kudos on that. Form factor is vanilla and maybe it doesn't matter since it's in the cabinet and I don't see it.Pros: Easy setup out of the box. customized to my account required no login. nice packaging.Con: Not wireless enabled. No power off. Lacks aesthetics (it's like a plastic paper weight).Wishes: Accessible from multiple TVs. Can link with the Echo so I can tell Alexia to turn off Netflix and other movie apps from the kitchen. Or better yet, Echo would be the single device that replaces all the Amazon devices for the house.

First off it barely connected to my TV. I had to wiggle the wire to get it to make a connection, that was not impressive. Then, I use the \"voice search\" feature. It only will search for amazon prime shows, it does not search netflix. Pretty annoying, then I go to buy something and have to call customer support to get the coins to work.  Then I click on \"download\" a app, now nothing works, it is just stuck downloading. I called customer service, they cant do anything. So now I am just waiting now for it to finish downloading something I dont want. I am so annoyed, it has been 4 hours now, and cant watch anything for a game I dont want. Not very impressed, in fact it is making me angry. Do not buy this thing, you will be much happier with a Roku box. This is the worst thing I have ever owned for entertainment.  I was going to give it two stars, because it has tetris, now I want to give it -10 stars. I am going to throw it in the trash soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/7", "author": "coreymillia"}]
