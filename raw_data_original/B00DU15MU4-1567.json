Streaming our favorite shows is smooth and seamless as are the games we've tried. A great addition to our video entertainment selections. It is mounted to the back of our large flat screen, using the Amazon Total Mount, and there are no issues whatsoever using the provided remote. Also added the Fire TV to our Logitech universal remote and that works well. Pretty happy with our purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "C.
