Way better enginered than the Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Weaver Jones"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have been the happy and pleased owner of an Amazon Fire TV for some months now and I cannot say enough about it.  First I want to say that I was a Prime member before I bought it and Amazon registered it in my name before it was delivered.  I remember that I ordered it on a Friday and true to Prime delivery policy it was delivered in two days!  It arrived on Sunday morning.  I am challenged when it comes to connecting electronics but I had no problem hooking this up.  The instruction are so well done.  The packaging will insure that your Fire TV will arrive in good condition.  As you navigate through Fire TV you will be even more impressed with the variety of entertainment possibilities you now have at your fingertips.  And even as time goes by, Amazon continues to impress me by improving on a high quality item.  You will be able to find entertainment with a voice command.  It is almost magic.  I have challenged it and it is wonderful.  New movies and TV shows are added weekly.  As a result of getting my Fire TV I cancelled my cable service and have not looked back.  This is a quality service at more than a fair price. It is almost embarrassingly easy to use.  Amazon's Customer Service and support is wonderful.  This will be a wonderful addition to your leisure life. Highly recommended!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Alice M.
