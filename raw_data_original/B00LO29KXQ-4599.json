I had a blue ray player that was streaming capable and it was so slow.  The Fire TV stick is lightning fast and has a ton of content.  Some are subscription based, others are free.  Very easy to set up, just plug it into your HDMI port and start streaming.  Love Love Love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kimmy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is literally the best $39 device you can buy. My wife and I use this on a wall mounted 42\" LED in our bedroom (mostly because we have the Fire TV in the livingroom) and could not be more happy. They really shouldn't keep secret all the amazing things that it can do, like side loading OnLive and using it as a $2000 gaming PC. I could list awesome possibilities for this device until i'm out of available characters but the bottom line is if you don't have one of these, buy one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works well and easy to setup.

She is a very early riser, were talking like 4am sometimes on the weekend.  Guess who gets woke up to go put in the Netflix password or troubleshoot why it is only showing a black screen?  Our Chromecast and Roku are rock solid reliable but the Fire stick only works about 25% of the time.
