That has not proven to be the case. So Fire TV has turned out to be a disappointment thus far. It's possible that the library of films may be greater than I've encountered; if so, I've not yet figured out where they are hiding. On the other hand, my grandchildren have enjoyed binge watching some of the TV programs that are available. Fire TV was easy to install; it connected to my home network with no difficulty. And the voice feature on the remote works quite nicely once I learned to enunciate clearly. I also bought my grandchildren a Fire TV with a controller for their home; they tell me that the controller works well for gaming. Since I purchased the Fire TV primarily to stream movies, I have not taken the time to explore the other apps that are available. Also, I've not yet decided whether to subscribe to some of the pay services (e.g., Netflix).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marc O'Polo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My Fire TV is great!!! I had two different Roku 3's and had nothing but trouble with them.I was so frustrated with Roku's Tech Support  after spending hours on the phone and no issue resultion,The're so called \"Network\" experts had me changing router settings and dropping my Network security allto no avail. (which by the way was not the problem) I finally took the Roku's back, and bought my Fire TV.I can't say enough about the Fire-TV unit. I simply plugged it in and it worked right out of the box without any issues. I'm able to keep my network secure and stream my programing and movies without a problem.Way to Go Amazon!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brad Yurenko"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent.
