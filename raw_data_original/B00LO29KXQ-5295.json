But you can not stream a chrome browser window and many iOS and Android apps are supporting chrome cast to push to TV.Biggest advantage of this is the remote!  It's a pain to fast forward an YouTube video or some smartphone apps (e.g. YuppTV), but it's a a breeze with FireTV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "S.

This was a really easy one to set up. And the remote is nice and sleek, albeit, a bit to sensitive. I got this when it was on sale for $19 for Prime members. I like that it gives me really easy and fast access to all the video that I have through my Prime account. Before this I used the app on the Roku and it was slow and buggy. I do hope that Amazon expands that app library to include HBO Go and a few other missing ones. The one complaint I have is that I also bought the Fire Tablet 6 Inch and the app for the Fire TV does not work on it (cannot even install it). This is a very strange move by Amazon, which I hope they correct real soon. Besides that, I think that if you are an Amazon Prime member and deciding between this and the others, this one definitely is worth the buy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Akiva Zablocki"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Nice and easy to go to Netflix and other now", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rick"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Pretty good.
