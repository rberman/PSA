[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own a Roku 3, Chromecast, & PS3 \u2014 and the Fire TV is probably my go-to device. Turning the TV on and switching to the correct input just by pressing the home button (via HDMI-CEC) is worth the price alone (although I wish it would turn the TV off as well). A word of note, you'll need to use an external USB port; the one on your TV will be unpowered before the TV is on.The only issue I've had: the Stick gets stuck in a boot-loop if I use the TV's USB port, but using the wall charger is just as good.I haven't used the Fire TV box, but I don't see why you'd buy that. You can always use the app for voice search.If all you do is stream (and it doesn't even have to be Amazon content), then the Stick is what you're looking for. For the price, The Fire TV Stick is hard to beat.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Stuart Moore"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "What the heck? This thing works just as good as my Fire TV box, but it doesn't take up any space on the shelf. I just wish I had caught them when they were on sale for $19. Still, at $35, the Fire TV Stick is a bargain, and it functions much better than the two Roku devices we've had. I'm thinking of buying another one for the other bedroom as well. Definitely worth it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!!... Good but at $29.Great buy at $19!

I hooked this up today, and it was working great in 5 minutes. It may not have all the bells and whistles as the Fire TV, but it still packs a punch. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a small portable device to take with them anywhere. You don't even have to have an extra outlet for it as it can plug into both you TV or and outlet. Amazon recommends using the outlet, so I would go with that option first and foremost, but if need be, it can plug right into your TV for power. The remote is great, and I don't even miss the voice feature as I don't use it much on my Fire TV much anyway. Setup was easy as pie, and my boys love it. I bought it for their room and for taking with us when we go camping. They really like it for not just the video streaming but for the gaming. It does not support all the games that Fire TV does, but they do have enough to keep my boys happy. Who needs a gamebox anymore, when their more than enough mobile games out there. I would not even think about buying a gamebox ever again. At the current price, I still think this is well worth it, just as the Fire TV is. They are better than other device I have used in the past, and because they are sold by Amazon, you get the great customer service I have come to enjoy over the years.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James Bennett \"Second star to the right, and straight on till morning\""}]
