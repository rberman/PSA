If anyone is on the fence about buying this stick believe me you won't regret it, it has all the functions of a Roku 3 (minus the headphone jack in the remote) and the new in-app search function (if you use the phone or tablet app) is for sure something to write home about.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Pat"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I feel as though Roku felt pressured to release a Chromecast challenger. The form factor on the stick is larger than the Chromecast; the Roku doesn't fit on my Sony TV where the Chromecast does. I was only able to make it fit by 'forcing' it in and having it bent slightly.The good:Works just like the other RokusSets up fastHidden from sightDecent WiFi connectionThe bad:Larger than Chromcast, won't fit smaller TVs or TVs with curves in the port sections.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I pre-ordered as soon as I heard about it. Waiting was agonizing, but to my surprise it came 2 days earlier than expected.As soon as it arrived I ripped it out of the box, plugged it in and within minutes was adding apps and channels to watch.Setting up my Netflix, Amazon, and M-GO accounts was a breeze. M-Go offered 2 free movies out of the gate, so I watched \"Dallas Buyers Club\" and will watch Hunger Games 2 tonight.Picture quality is excellent. 1080p HD. Pause, stop, resume all work like a charm. Remote is very easy to use and intuitive. I should probably add that I have a 150mbps internet connection and my TV is about 5 feet from my ASUS RT-N66U Dual-Band Wireless-N900 Gigabit Router. With any wireless functionality, your connection speed and router will make or break it.The Vizio apps that come with the TV are nice, and I also already had a Samsung Blue ray player with smart apps , but it cant compare to the free content choices on the Roku. I love tech news and reviews and there are plenty of networks/apps to choose from... c|net, Revision3, TechSmart, Twit, Tech Crunch, Blip TV and more.You Tube, Live Stream and Ted are also favorites that I was previously tied to my desk or tablet to watch.NBA game time, NHL Game Center, Watch ESPN, CBS Sports, are all free. MLB TV requires a subscription from MLB. There's also regional and collegiate sports content. MMA, WWE, UFC all have content apps.There's also a lot of specialty content for Food and Cooking, Car Buffs, Conspiracy Theorist, Comedy, Old Movies, Classical Music and Jazz Concerts, and on and on. There is more free content, than paid content. However, you will likely want to get one or more of the Premium movie and content services like Amazon, M-Go, or Netflix.Cable companies better wake up.  This is what TV on demand should be. It's hard to beleive that access to all of this content is only $50 for the unit and that's it! If these were stations offered by my cable company I'd be paying at least an additional $80+ A MONTH, and would have to take a bunch of channels that I don't even want just to get the few that I do.I can't say enough about it. If you are on the fence between this and Chromecast  you'd be a fool to go for the limitations of the  Chromecast instead. It can't even compare. Download the Roku app for Android or iOS and you can do all of that TV casting stuff from your mobile device to your TV that you see in the commercials, and run Roku using your phone or tablet as a remote and previewer.Hands down, this is the best streaming device on the market to date and the best catalog of free content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "47/53", "author": "H.

Just be sure you have it installed in an area with good WiFi.  The electronics inside the TV might act as block to your WiFI signal.  I had to adjust the angle of my TV so that the signal gets there readily.  Roku has many many many channels and content providers...some free, some paid.

I wanted this Roku Streaming Stick for my master bedroom itself, where I have the TV wall-mounted and the cables hidden. I did not want to add another power cable hanging down to plug-in, so the convenience of being able to power this off of USB (via Vizio TV maintenance port) was great.SETUP: Quick and Easy, just like with the Roku 1.Really, really simple to setup. I plugged it into the HDMI port on the back of my TV and, as previously mentioned, plugged the power cable into the USB maintenance port. No cable mess hanging down.. you don't even know it's there.I changed my TV input to the proper HDMI port and there was that 'Roku' logo just like I hoped for. It looked for the remote, which I had already inserted the included Duracell batteries, and found it with no issue (I was worried about possible interference with my Roku 1 remote only a few foot away in the next room, but none). I connected to WiFi, went to the Roku Link website from another internet capable device that it directs you to, and off it went performing 'Software Updates.' Within 10 minutes from opening the box I was watching a show on Netflix.USE: No issuesThe response of the device itself to remote control commands was very snappy and responsive. The device itself seems to be 'snappier' then my Roku 1 is as far as opening up my different channels.Overall:Two days in, I am very happy with the device. I have experienced no anomalies or issues and it was quick and simple to setup. Having already used the Roku 1, I did not even open up the manual that came with the stick and still have not needed it. Setup was very intuitive and simple to get you going.

Chromecast has very limited options and it plays only 2 apps.This one has lots of apps and its easy to use. I am using iphone remote and its making it lot easier.  All the apps are working perfectly fine . you need subscription for few like Netflix, HBO. etc.So far I have used youtube, netflix,hbo, espn, vevo, dishworld, etcOnly problem I have seen is wireless connection. it didnt loose while running but sometime whenever it is turned off /turned on, its takes forever to connect to wireless router and most of the time it says no wire less connection and ask to  reset router.But once it is connected and it works very well. But I ended up spending atleast 10 mins everytime and kept retrying.Also if roku adds wireless headset to remote it will be excellent :)Pros - Easy to use, lots of apps (more than chromecast and apple tv)Cons- wireless connection while starting", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Deepak D Jadhav"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Did I get a faulty device?
