[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I ordered two of these during the special rate sale. Out of the box it is very easy to install and I used the included adapter because one of our TVs is very close to the wall.I got this mainly because our kitchen TV is a Samsung Smart TV and Samsung doesn't include Amazon Prime as one of the apps.The Firestick works great and is very fast but the menu system is a pain to use for screen mirroring. You have to navigate to a submenu selection to use it. If Amazon put screen mirroring on the main selection choices it would make this a killer device and far more usable. The same applies for the other apps although I can see for that Amazon wants to direct you to their content first.I use screen mirroring all the time so it makes doing that far more difficult than it should be. I would rate it 5 stars if this was as straightforward as it should be. The screen mirroring does work well and I tired it will a Samsung Note 3 and several different ASUS tablets, each connected quickly and the displays worked just as they should.I really liked that Crackle is an included app. Although I haven't used it much previously, since it's included I will use it more often.Note to AMAZON: If you make the HDMI connection point a swivel that would make it the best stick connector on the market. :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Red Lightning \"It isn't impossible, you just can't figure it out.\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is an excellent product and it is very easy to install. I normally use my PlayStation console to stream Netflix and Amazon Prime. But now that I have the Fire Stick its much more convenient. So far everything I'm watching is streaming at peak performance with no issues. I paid $20 for mine because of the Prime member pre order offer they had last month and at that price it was a definite steal. For $40 retail, it's still worth the price for what it has to offer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Oscar R."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "A little glitchy and slow, but great replacement for my old Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TDO"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Set up was easy and fairly straight forward.  It would help to have arrows on the remote on the circle at the top.  Took me a bit to figure out how that worked.

I bought this for $19 when it was first announced. Like all Amazon electronic devices I feel like this is a pipeline to get people to buy products from Amazon but I have no issue with that. I've been a prime member for years and I watch movies occasionally. This makes that easier so whats not to like. When you first use it there it there is a \"corny\" intro for people who have never used something like this but it can be skipped. $39 is cheaper than a roku, or Apple tv and while these are not intended to replace those devices I think they can be a cheaper alternative with some of the same features like Netflix and Hulu plus if you just want to stream movies.The remote is handy and you can download an app for your phone so you can use your phone as a remote too. Personally I hate having another remote control but I don't want more crap on my phone either so I just stick it in a drawer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It Works fine but I see no difference than my firetv. so kind of a waste of space and hmdi port.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "bothreed"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Initially took a long time to download and install updates. This is a \"feature\" of new tech that I do not appreciate.Setup was easy, if annoying. No, you can't skip the introductory video.Unfortunately, it will randomly turn off my TV, and render it incapable of turning back on until the Fire Stick is removed. Moved it around in the HDMI slots, unplugged other HDMI devices, but to no avail.Since I got it with the Prime discount it's not worth the time to return it.

Hulu+ wasn't part of the set  item so I had to menu through to find it, which was easy enough.My only \"?\" moment was that it had to download new software- it was new out of the box and had just launched. Why was there anything that needed  to be downloaded as \"new\" so soon? Once I got passed that, it's fine.I chose Fire over Chromecast or other options because I like how small it is (unlike another box) but unlike Chromecast, there's an option to plug it into the wall to power it as my TV is just old enough that it doesn't have the port that Chromecast requires to power the device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrea K"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Seems to work okay.  Have had to unplug it and plug it back in a few times when it freezes up.  Speaking of which, the description is kind of misleading - it needs to be plugged in to a power source.
