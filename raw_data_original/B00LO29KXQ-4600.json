She is a very early riser, were talking like 4am sometimes on the weekend.  Guess who gets woke up to go put in the Netflix password or troubleshoot why it is only showing a black screen?  Our Chromecast and Roku are rock solid reliable but the Fire stick only works about 25% of the time.  I'm returning it and getting another Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "mark"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this.

Bought the ChromeTV first and took it back because you don't get a remote; you have to use your phone or tablet to manage everything. Well, signing into my phone to change channels or search proved to be too much hassle. I can use the FireTV remote now OR I can use my phone or tablet.  And, with the app on the phone I can simply speak into the app what I am looking for to watch and it pops up!!! You don't have to type your search with the remote into that lengthy search page. With Amazon Prime you get more content than you can watch in a lifetime.I have already used the Amazon prime to order things as well. Free shipping on everything means the price you see online is the price you pay. There is no additional charges.  The Amazon prime has already saved me $32 in shipping birthday presents and I have only had it for 3 weeks!  I could not be happier about my decision to go FireTV.
