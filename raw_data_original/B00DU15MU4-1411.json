My only quibble is that it's not as easy to use as a Roku, in that Amazon tries hard to make it difficult to use competing services like Netflix and Acorn.  I switched from Roku to Amazon Fire because my Roku was old, bought for use with an older HD TV with no HDMI connection.  I could only use system at 780i.  Now, with a newer TV I wanted 1080p resolution so thought I'd try the Amazon unit.  It gives a nice, clear picture with no bobbles so far.  I'll learn to live with a different interface with other services, I guess.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles W. Muser"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works as advertised. Very clear picture and the remote with voice command works exceptionally.

I received it for Christmas and I just love it.  I have honestly used it almost every day since I have owned it.  I also had no idea that you could play games on it, which just sweetens the deal even more.  Not much more to say than this is just an awesome product.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  With all of the integration to Amazon, which I use regularly, it makes this truly a must-own for Prime members.  If you don't have Prime, do yourself a favor and get it!
