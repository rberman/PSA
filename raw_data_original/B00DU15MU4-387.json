If you're not a Prime member this will likely pay for the membership (getting shipping nice, too). I guess the HBO2Go issue is fixed but isn't a big deal for us.Things like an OD on The Closer for free and getting the first 2 season of The Americans (remembering) arre great.Hook up was HDMI cable to three TV, 15 minutes of swearing while I reconfigured the power strip and maybe 3 minutes software configuration. It came setup with our Prime ID & such so we were watching a movie inside of 30 minutes.Get the Fire TV app for your smart phone. Having a keyboard is worth the price.

I wanted to be able to stream prime music, and it works superb. I also use the Netflix and YouTube apps. The prime tv and movies is excellent. I connected an HDMI cable to my 1080p tv and a digital optical cable to my surround sound receiver. Movies on both prime and netflix that stream in dolby digital pass to the receiver just fine. Superb quality for music and tv audio. Also the apps are much faster in loading than the apps on my tv. The only thing I'd say is that to open the remote you need a screw driver to pop it open. No biggie there.

Allows for all your media apps to be in one place. Voice search is pretty neat, too. Probably going to sign up for Amazon Prime now to maximize my multimedia experience. One thing that irks me about it is the home screen will periodically be \"unavailable\" so I'm essentially staring at a blank screen.
