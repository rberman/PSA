[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I put the Amazon Fire box for my downstairs TV and loved it but also wanted to watch TV in my bedroom but not spend another $100.  The Fire TV Stick at $35 couldn't be better.  The picture is perfect - I get my Netflix movies and my Amazon Prime stuff with no complaints.  Other than the voice remote for the Amazon Fire, I really don't see any difference in the two devices.

TV ads and even the product description on the website is misleading because it omits to show the power cord, which is necessary to perate the device. Also, the device constantly buffers so that it is impossible to watch a program from beginning to end without major interruptions and delays.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Barry M.
