The remote is simple, small, and easy to use.

I got Roku as a Christmas gift and from day one the remote didn't work correctly kept freezing up and load time was ridiculous waiting and waiting.So I returned to Roku and ordered this. Original delivery was set for February 20th I guess they were on back order but I ended up getting it January 12th and I have to say this Amazon stick is much better than Roku, no freezing remote and it's much faster load time to start up. You can download all the same things on it as well. And it's $10 cheaper than Roku too. I'm happy with my purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nicole P \"Nicole\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought it so that I could watch my shows while I'm at the deer lease, but I ended up keeping it in my home office!

This one factor alone...makes chromecast a better choice (but barely). The other features are nice (except amazon prime which demands you pay for videos, then after you pay, it runs commercials) it has very few decent games and apps that are free. Most of  the games are knocking each other off of which, aren't something most people would play...amazon just put them up there so it looks like they have content. Most of the decent games require a game controller (which also must be special ordered) another $40 each. After getting the controller ...you would think games would use the control sticks to move around but often its the L or R triggers (waste of money). This device (and its app shop) needs at least 3-6 months more development before its good enough to be sold to the public. The device crashes a few times a day, which is normal from reading others reviews. Based on all this, my current suggestion is purchase a chromecast, while it has its issues (half the hardware a ASTV is)..at least you get what you see (litterally your whole desktop if needed) with no extra hidden cost.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Our TV and Blue Ray player did not support Amazon Prime streaming video and we were missing out on a lot of programming.

It is very easy to use.  I always use closed captioning when I watch movies or TV.  Even though a movie shows 'cc' on the screen the system does not always allow you to change to change it.  I finally found a movie that did and now I have closed captioning on everything which is what I wanted.
