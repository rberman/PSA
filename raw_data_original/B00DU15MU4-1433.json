It has some different apps, but most are just designed to nickle and dime or advertise you to death. It does use substantially less electricity than my tower or game consoles to put internet programming, like Netflix and Amazon prime, on my TV. I did find 4 new apps I actually use so far. This was a gift for me so for free it is great! I do not know if I would ever actually find it desirable enough to purchase or not. If you have favorite apps you should research whether or not they are available on the fire and how they are rated. Many reviews I have read state that the apps here are inferior to the identical app for other equipment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CARLTON R CROFT JR"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best decision ever to get this device!
