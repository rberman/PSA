It's a nice way to have access to all of my amazon music, and the library of Amazon Prime shows, etc. I already have an Apple TV for Netflix/Hulu, but find the interface on this is actually pretty nice too, so I end up switching back and forth. I mostly use it now for Prime shows that aren't available on AppleTV but I may use it more in the future as they offer gaming and things that the Apple TV doesn't currently offer. The controller is a little easier to use than the Apple TV one as well. The actual stick itself is a little awkward, even though it is small I had a tough time finding a place to put it. It actually is connected to the back of my receiver (cord is really short), but it works...just a little wonky. Another thing I like is the remote does not have to be in line-of-sight with the FireStick to work, like the Apple TV does, so I can keep my hand under the covers on the couch and it still works fine. If you don't have a streaming media device, I'd recommend this one if it has the features you need as the price is great. The interface is also probably my favorite compared to Apple TV, Roku, Sony/PS3, etc. If you already have an Apple TV, you're not getting a whole lot of new features, but for streaming Prime or adding basic games to your home theater, it may be worth it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jules Fitzegibbons"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Megan Hariz"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Anticipation waiting for almost 2 months to get it.
