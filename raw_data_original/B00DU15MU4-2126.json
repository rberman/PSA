She doesn't need to press more than two buttons. Many of the old BBC shows she enjoys are offered on Prime, which was another reason. She's been happy with the product.The only complaint is they'll offer several seasons of a show, Murdoch Mysteries is one, and when you get to the final seasons suddenly they want to charge and it isn't cheap. Also some of the movies are pricey, more than On Demand.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "A. Mosa"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really do like the fire tv.  In fact a second one just arrived today.  I have three rokus and yes the fire is faster but the problem I have with amazon fire is it doesn't have the hbo app nor the gaiamtv app.  I use both of these apps frequently and will keep using them on my rokus.  I hope amazon fire will soon offer these two apps.
