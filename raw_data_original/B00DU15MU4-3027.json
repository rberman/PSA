[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I gave up on TV 10 years ago because I cannot stand commercials - and much of what was on TV wasn't worth my time either.  In lieu, I became an audio book junkie.

That said, I have been totally unimpressed by all of the previous TV streaming devices on the market - until now.William Hardin nailed this device in his \"pros\" review.  His \"cons\" seem to be \"filler\" content only - they are completely negligible.  This device works great and at lightening speeds.  Easier to use than any cable box and faster (like a jet compared to a horse and buggy) than any other streaming box available.Bottom Line: economical;  super fast;  easy interface.

A few minutes later, and it was working super!  It is pretty simple to find a TV series to watch that is available on Prime, and movies that are available on Prime.  I watched both for a few hours and never had a single glitch.My only actual complaints are two.  One is that the pictures it shows of the various selections of entertainment are in rather poor quality.  That is, they are blurry and I often had to get up and walk closer to the movie cover being illustrated on my 59\" HDTV so that I could read it.  It appears these are recorded in the lowest quality pictures of MOST, but not ALL, covers, so it appears to be more a fault with the provider of the movie cover not using a high quality bitmap.  Two, the first TV series I watched was Season 1 of Vikings.  I finished it, and that is an awesome series by the way, but, the picture was rather washed out.  Considering that the content is available in Hi-def, it's a shame that Amazon could not include the Hi-def version with Prime, instead of the \"made for tube TV version\".I should point out that I also got to play with a Roku-2 last week (a friend brought it over), and I have to say that the Fire is most definitely faster and easier to use than the Roku-2.  I hear that there is content available on the Ruku-2 that is not available on the Fire, but I don't care about that, because I'm only really interested in Prime movies and TV content.The only thing that prevented me from making this a 5 star rating is that a fair amount of the Prime content is not Hi-def.  I know I could pay for the Hi-def version, but my cable bill is already too high and my \"better half\" prefers to watch TV on cable.  So to save the money, I will take what I get, regardless of the definition.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Knightwind"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "One of the coolest things we've ever bought.
