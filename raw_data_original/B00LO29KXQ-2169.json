[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I have owned this device for a while now as I preordered it. I am still waiting to be able to mirror an iOS, Mac or Windows tablet to this device. That was my primary reason for getting it, but it seems that it probably will never work well if at all. I did finally take it on a trip and played some Netflix movies in a hotel room. That was nice, but I would still really like to mirror my devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert F.

This is very fast and portable. While I mostly use it for Hulu Plus (which does require a subscription fee), I use it for Amazon Prime Instant and Pandora too. There are many other options.  It was very easy to connect to my tv.  It probably took me less than 5 minutes from box to using it.The only thing I notice as a difference between amazon fire tv and fire tv stick is the optical audio out option on fire tv, but the sound is still very good.  I have my optical audio on the fire tv hooked to an stereo system so if you have one, you may opt for the additional cost.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jill W. \"Jill\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the Fire Stick, it is so easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charlotte H."}]
