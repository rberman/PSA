After 2 days I went back to roku.  More channels available and easier to use for me.  Nice concept on the fire tv but not ready for prime time as far as I am concerned.  The amazon prime is mixed up with the pay for and I am not in the mood most of the time to try and figure out if I will be charged for what I want to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/7", "author": "Teresa L. Allen"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Responsiveness: I'm speaking of navigation responsiveness. It's marginally better than Roku 3. I attribute this to the extra memory and processing power of the Fire.Apps: Currently, the app community is fledgling.  There's only a handful of apps including a few games, a few streaming services (like Netflix and Hulu).Interface: If you stream a lot from Amazon, like me, the interface will grow on you.  The voice recognition helps when searching the Amazon database but it won't help you with Netflix or other streaming services - at least not that I have discovered.  For other services, like Netflix, the Fire's interface treats them like lower cast citizens.  They're apps in the traditional sense - like watching Netflix on your iPad.  The interface is designed to be an interface to Amazon's streaming service.  Everything else is just an app.For this, I like Roku's agnostic interface a little better.Streaming.  I got the Fire because I was hoping the HD streaming from Amazon would be better.  I no longer get drops in HD, but I get a lot of pauses, hops back, and screens of static.  In general, I would say the streaming (perhaps due to better buffering) is a bit better on the Fire than it is on Roku3 - I'm not sure it's enough to warrant dropping $100 on the Fire.Remote: The remote is fairly simple to operate.  It has a built in microphone for the voice recognition, aside from that, it's a pretty basic, clean remote that reminds me of the Roku3's remote.  Having said that, I really miss the Roku3's remote headphone jack.  At first I didn't think I would use the headphone jack but when the wife is asleep or when I want to watch TV without competing with other things going on, it was really nice to use the Roku3's headphone jack.  The ear buds work really well too.  So, for this, I have to say the Roku3's remote is better. I haven't found too many reasons to use the Fire's voice recognition because I'm not always on Amazon. I like Netflix and for that, the voice recognition of Fire is only marginally useful.In summary, (for me!) I found the headphone jack of Roku3 a feature that I value much more than I anticipated.  For this reason,  I may end up going back Roku3.  If you haven't used the Roku3 and you do a lot of streaming from Amazon, then I think this is a good streamer to get and I would recommend it. You may also have a good alternative to the headphone jack feature that Roku3 provides.  The extra horsepower of the Fire is nice but the benefits, so far, seem marginal.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Barret"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This box is great, can install xbmc, and runs it well.
