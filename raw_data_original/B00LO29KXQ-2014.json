I have to say I prefer the Fire TV. The stick tends to buffer at least once per episode when watching TV on Hulu. The buffering is only a split second, but I have never noticed it on the Fire TV. It is not a bad purchase and I love being able to have my son watch Netfix on any of the televisions. I have noticed that sometimes the screen goes black after the commercial breaks sometimes, but I can hear the dialogue of the show I am watching. I think this may be a Hulu issue and not the Amazon Fire stick or TV since I haven't noticed this happening with Netflix. I just exit out of the show and click on Resume Episode. It fixes the issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stacey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ricardo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.
