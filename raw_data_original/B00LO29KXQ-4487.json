I love how small this thing is.  About the size of a thumb drive and it plugs right into the back of the tv.  No wires and no more bluray player sitting on my mantle.  So far the streaming performance has been better than that of the bluray player.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

I like the small size and low power usage. Had no problem hooking up to home network and accessing web content. I was also able to sideload the kodi media player to access media files on the home network. Menu responses are snappy and the included remote is functional. I see a recent firmware update made playing the next episode automatic in Netflix, etc. I haven't seen a way to make that optional. Apart from that, very satisfied.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TexBrit \"Martin\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product!
