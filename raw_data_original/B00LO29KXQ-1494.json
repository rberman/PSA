[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is a layman review. It's works pretty good but does freeze up sometimes. The app for our phones also freezes up sometimes. Every freeze, whether on the app or on the stick, requires a power down and reset. Also most of the apps the Fire Stick offers are paid in some way. Crackle is good, Netflix and Amazon Prime we expected to pay for, but with our old Blu Ray we had about 40 free apps. Plus we notice that movies we never used to pay for on Amazon Prime on the old aystem....we now have to pay for! Not cool. Finally, app has a nifty voice search function but guess where it takes you? Amazon Prime only. It won't search other apps (like Netflix hint hint?)All in all, good video and audio but definitely feel like we are being fleeced on cash. And no way this late in  the cell phone app game should we have to suffer freezes and restarts. A 9 year old could program better than that!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "john stenzel"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I have the fire TV just purchased this fire TV stick for my man cave let's just say I should to of purchased the fire TV it is slow and looses Internet connection a lot not to happy so far", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Kenneth Green"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The streaming is pretty mediocre.  I can't stream MLB.TV without very frequent lag.  Netflix always has issues.  I have the fastest internet in the area and still there are so many issues with it.  I am a very loyal Amazon Prime member but had to purchase the the Fire TV Stick at Best Buy because Amazon was out.  What a poor choice.  I should have purchased something else (Chromecast or Roku Stick).  Fire TV Stick is pretty useless.  On top of that, set up was much more difficult than Amazon made it seem.  In the photo you can see how I am experiencing slow streaming and it just basically is unwatchable on the MLB.TV app.  If the app doesn't work, don't offer it and I would not have bought the Fire TV Stick.  My router basically across the room from where the stick is plugged into a Samsung TV.  There should be few streaming problems, but even Netflix stinks with the device.  Real bummer overall.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Bill Clinton \"Bill Clinton\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I've had this now for about three weeks, acquired when I elected to rejoin Sling TV and I took advantage of the promotion whereby the Stick was free with a three month prepaid subscription. Playback is occasionally choppy on all the services I use, including (and especially) Sling TV, Netflix, Hulu and Plex. Seems to work pretty well on Amazon Instant Video content though...how about that. Even though my home wireless-N network is speedy and running on a 30 Mbps cable internet connection, playback issues are frequent and annoying. I just don't think this little stick has the processing firepower to produce an acceptable (by my standards) level of performance. I wanted to like this device, especially after Mr. Busey's sales pitch, but I don't think it's going to be true love. Since I got it on a promo I guess I'm stuck with it--I'm not willing to take a chance on returning it for a regular Fire TV and paying another 60 bucks for the privilege.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Colby D.

Namely, it has good support for Amazon streaming and netflix, but it's awful for Mlb.tv and doesn't offer nbc sports. I get messages that my bandwidth might be too low during mlb.tv games. Speedtest.net suggests I'm pulling down 80mbps though on an old wireless mac (wireless n). Accordingly, I would not recommend this to anyone except for people who might only want to watch Amazon content.Also, I was hoping that my Echo would work with this, but it doesn't.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AWS"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Not bad - but many apps have buffering problems (and I have 20MPS Cable Internet). Pluto TV and PBS I watch the most. I do not recommend Crackle as it has absolutely no issues playing commercials cleanly and smoothly but all sorts of buffering problems playing content. You think they'd realize that people aren't there for the commercials....but corporate ignorance is never to be underestimated.
