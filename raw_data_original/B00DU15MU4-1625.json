At first I was not able to do photos or music. I finally realized I had to go to system/about and then scan for the latest updates, then I had everything on the main menu like I expected. The picture quality is excellent and I have not had any buffering problems. I do have Comcast internet. I have already canceled my Netflix and I am going to cut the cord with my U-Verse. ($87.00 per month) I will have to live without my CNBC but the app for Bloomberg will have to do. I had been using my Nintendo for Prime and Netflix but the Fire TV is much smoother and faster.

I did a bunch of research before buying the product. I usually use Apple Products but I thought that the Apple TV was too expensive, not the device, but the price of movies, shows, etc. I looked at the Chrome Cast, but just didn't feel comfortable about it.I already have a Prime Account so this was a very logical choice. I will have access to tons of movies and TV shows as well as games for my granddaughter and myself. I liked the child controls that are available, you can set how much time your child watches or plays in a day and the content that they can go to.I also liked the ease of the set up. (Although I was disappointed that an HDMI cable was not included, come on, really, just add $5.00 more to the price and include the cable). It did tie in quickly and easily to my Wireless Network. I didn't use a cable to tie in but just signed on wireless.As soon as it was turned on and plugged into the HDMI it went to Amazon and started to download the latest software update. Once that was completed it was automatically signed on to my Prime account, I did not have to do anything else.We started to browse and I watched my first movie within minutes.The sound quality and the picture quality are outstanding. The sound tied directly to my surround sound without me having to do anything.So far, I'm sold.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "William D.

It was purchased as a Christmas gift after having seen the commercials, and as I have Amazon Prime, I love a way to be able to stream Prime Movies on my TV. I even tried out the voice search, and I just couldn't help myself, but I had to say \"Gary Busey\"!.  ha ha ha...it worked!
