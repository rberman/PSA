And it does cut out more then my wireless blue ray which is right next to this wireless device. But it does work and I wont return so I will give it the 3 stars as its okay mainly because it is easy.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/4", "author": "maria cahill"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "very easy to hook up and get started.  component that you talk in to search works great. i wish there were more movies and shows for free on amazon prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pen Name"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a fabulous product for the technically challenge.

I was fed up with the buffering, re-buffering, lost of internet connectivity, out of sync programs, hiccups, and other annoyances, so I tried Fire TV.The specs were impressive, so I decided to give it a try. Performance was even better than I expected. Setup was very easy and only required entering a passkey for my router. I watched a movie. It started almost immediately and played smoothly. Voice control is a killer feature. it is definitely worth the price. I suspect newer smart HDTV's will start using this technology, but until then, the Amazon Fire TV is the way to go.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Shorian \"gadget guru\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very great movie choice, my only down fall for this item is the amount of data watching a movie takes.
