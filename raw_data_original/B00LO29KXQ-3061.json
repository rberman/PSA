Sadly, it didn't work at all. We could never even access it via the HDMI port of a Sony HDTV. Amazon's tech support was available but unhelpful. After trying everything, we had to send it back, and I ordered another comparable product from another company. I won't trust Amazon products ever again.

And hey...no subscriptions for a whole lot of it.BIG BAD \"MUST KNOW\" FOR COMCAST PROVIDED!Comcast is the only holdout who will not allow the HBO2GO streaming...the only one. They are also blocking it on PS3 & PS4.Oh, oh, oh...I forgot to mention that you to (if you use the OneClick)... stop it immediately!! My cats ordered three movies while I was at the store because I left the remote on the sofa and if you don't \"logout\"...a few pressured steps with no time limit on inputting information allows my party pussys to o0rder the movies BUTTTTTTTTTTTT because there is another step which actually requires the mouse or whatever to be moved and follow a command which allows me to cancel before bought, but it is because of  \"One-Click\" activated is kinda like butt-dialing people when you didn't mean to.Give them their own power source with surge protection, these things seem to be ubber sensitive to anything to takes away from their sources.I am on the fence about the pluses and minuses,IF....  you have  one tv that is NOT in an area where other electronics are on, etc. then it's good because the stick is wireless...you'll love it.IF...  you have the surround sound, CPU, router, modem...yadda, yadda, yadda in some \"entertainment center then the ONLY way to go is the Fire TV...awesome signal with an HDMI connection with its own box and direct connection with ethernet making for awesome speed in connecting to the ridiculously endless array for programs, news sources (video blogs, issue groups. It has some of the coolest \"where-the-hell-were these programs\" when I was going to school.The voice command is cool but it only works when you're in Amazon Instant or Prime. You can't use it on another site like Netflix.Bottom line is it is a good produce by turning your TV into a SmartTV without having to buy something that most of us don't need (OLD TV's still good) and most couldn't or wouldn't replace UNLESS need be.Stick is perfect for spare bedroom, secondary \"out-of-way\" but for constant connection and WAY less issues get the Amazon Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Melani Hughes"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Not bad.
