Had I known how crappy this was I wouldn't have spent the $50. Should have returned it.

It is fantastic technology and will save us tons on our cable bill. I am also able to access my premium channels from any tv that I install the fire stick on- which is nice...

Apps and videos freeze, pause, restart, freeze again, etc.  Often I get a \"video error\" when watching certain news apps.  VERY frustrating.  I have tried ALL of the trouble shooting suggestions from Amazon and everyone else and nothing works.  I e-mailed customer service and they suggested I call them.  I HATE calling anyone's customer service only to be told to do the exact same things I have already done.  My Internet connection is strong, there is nothing wrong with my TV, etc..... VERY frustrating.  I really wanted to like the Fire Stick so that I can disconnect from COMCAST completely.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "d still"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Simply perfect.

I bought the stick to view Netflix and it continuously stops mid viewing to stream stops at 25% and then gives an error.  I have reviewed other posts about this problem and the general consensus is that Netflix and Fire TV stick need to get their act together and fix the bug. Otherwise I would absolutely love this technology. I do not understand why this is a problem. I would love to hear any fixes but so far nothing helps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michaela E. Fry"}]
