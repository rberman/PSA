I went in search of something that would remedy that, because their tech support at Samsung told me it was not their issue it was Yahoo Widgets I needed.  (That isn't true - you can't even buy widgets from Yahoo-most likely Samsung can't afford programmers to fix that software upgrade that ruins your internet).  Anyway, this little Amazon Fire Stick remedied everything. It returned all my options like getting access to my Amazon Prime movies and Hulu Plus TV and now I am happy again.  There isn't a lot of difference between the Fire TV Stick and the Fire TV - you only need one or the other and I didn't realize that, so I bought both thinking they would work together.  Actually, I am keeping both because I can use Amazon Fire on the big tv (its remote has voice command and is a bit more convenient).  But the Fire TV Stick has most of the same features without voice command so I am using it on the smaller Samsung. I find both Fire TV and TV Stick have extremely high definition and nice selection of games, prime music, prime movies, Hulu TV and everything I really wanted.  Love both.

Well, we finally got the batteries in and we have enjoyed the programs that we get from this Fire Stick.

We recently signed up with a satellite television provider that we're not at all happy with. The selection of movies leaves a lot to be desired unless we want to pay for almost every one of them. I bought the Fire TV Stick at my local Staples store, took it home, set it up in less than ten minutes and it works GREAT! TV shows, movies, videos; it's all there. What surprised me is how easy it is to move the device from one television to another. Just unplug, take it for a stroll, and plug it into any other TV, just as easily as plugging in any USB device. Once it's on your wireless system, it's there. VERY simple to set up, great selection of shows, works anywhere there's a wifi connection (including my RV), and a huge selection is available with no addition charge other than your Amazon Prime membership. One of the best features is the ability to search for exactly what you want to watch; if you want to see an available list of John Wayne movies, select \"John Wayne\". If you want a specific genre, just select it. You can also select just the free Amazon Prime listings, recent movies, kids shows, and so on. There's just nothing bad about this little device!  If you have an Amazon Prime membership, either buy the Fire TV Stick online at Amazon and it automatically is registered, or buy it at a box store and register it yourself. Easy either way, and the price is the same. I like simple, and I like things that work like they're supposed to. This is both.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eva M.
