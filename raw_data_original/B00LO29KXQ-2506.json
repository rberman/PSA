[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I had to return the Fire Stick because it buffered/skipped when watching netflix. I have a Roku 3 and a Roku 2 that both work flawlessly, so it was not my wireless network, it was either poor design/hardware or just bad luck and I got defective product. Also the Fire Stick is too Amazon centric for me, I expected the product to be a little less pushy with Amazon products. Save yourself the time and just get a Roku (not the roku stick though it sucks too).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "foo"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I have repeated issues with the internet connection, upgraded my router to accomodate the issue.

The horsepower of the Fire TV Stick is impressive and will be my travel device. I have added a bluetooth keyboard/mouse and side-loaded Firefox to add a browser to increase utility to this device. I purchased this at the starting price of $19 to give it a chance since the specs were sooo much better than similar device and wish that I could have bought 10 at the time. The Fire TV Stick is worth the cost of $39 and plan to pick up a few more to give as presents.

I like the Fire stick. I prefer the Apple tv. I find that the Fire stick's functionality is simply...kludgy. It is awkward in its layout. How it fast forwards and rewinds is also awkward. It is slow to respond and I find I have to do a lot more clicking around than I should.When I first got this, it didn't have HBO Go, which I found annoying, but as of March that problem was resolved. I would like to see it offer more television stations than it does however.Fundamentally, the stick is simply not as graceful a device as the Apple tv. Nor does it have as many channels. If you are choosing between the two, I'd go with Apple, unless, of course, you want access to Amazon prime and other Amazon tv/movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
