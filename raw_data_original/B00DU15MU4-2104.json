The lack of news channels is a huge drawback.  Beside from that, if you also have Amazon Prime, I think it is fantastic.  The voice command is super smart.

I bought  the FireTV to replace a older model ROKU, and except for the voice search I have been disappointed. Firse I paid $99 for the fire and within a short time the price was reduced to $84, secondly the FireTV is no better than the $35 ROKU I bought for a second tv. We use the FireTV to access Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Youtube.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/4", "author": "Evelyn Terrell"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love that this can play amazon prime and Pandora.  I feel like the interface for finding application could be a little easier and the cool feature of being able to speak into the remote to search for things only works for amazon on demand items and not for searching under other apps like Netflix.  I also wish it was better at differentiating between amazon prime movies and shows and those that require payment.  I would also prefer that when you did want to pay for something on amazon prime, you could do it right now the Amazon fire instead of having to go online first.  Lastly, I wish it had the ability to play iPad and iPhone stuff on this like with the apple TV.  All and all, I prefer the apple TV over this if I had to choose because of all of these missing features, but I do like what it offers that Apple TV does not offer like amazon prime, Pandora and speaking into the remote.  Oh also, I was looking forward to using the Showtime app, but it only works for some providers and Direct TV is not one of them which is my provider for Showtime so I was disappointed that I wasn't able to use this feature.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "JAM"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I pay for amazon prime but what there giving you is not much for your money.

A piece of Velcro can stick it to the Tv . Its easy to use , ,It has voice command , Its streams nice ,. Cons . I don't see everything it says I was getting . The marketing tricks you into believing you are getting more , Voice command always takes me to amazon , even if i'm on Netflix , It relies on apps to get me some things I thought would be on the solid state . It needs a plug  in a already clustered area . No way to type in searches . Needs a keyboard . you can do it text style but this comes back to voice command always takes you back to amazon , If i'm on netflix voice commands are useless .All in all its what I can expect , Not what I was wishing for , I have a box of old tech gear from over the years that gave me what I could expect and some raising me hopes enough to believe in this will be the coolest thing ever , Then when I got it It was exactly the way they said it was in small print .I suppose i'm feeling buyers empathy right now , I'm Just used to getting something good enough to make me keep it and not waste my time sending it back  .
