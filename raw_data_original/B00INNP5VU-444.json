[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I own 2 Roku 1 players and 1 Roku Lt player so I expected the Roku Streaming Stick to be just as wonderful.  With the others, I just plugged them in and they worked.  However, with the stick, it took me 3 attempts to connect to my 2.4 network and it refuses to connect to the 5ghz network.  After connecting to the 2.4Ghz network, it kept freezing up.  I returned it and ordered another Roku 1 which I love.  The TV that I attempted to attach it to is a Philips Smart TV.  However, the Smart TV doesn't have as many options as Roku.  I am running a Netgear Dual Band router with a range extender to the other side of the house.  The Roku 1 works perfectly in the location that I attempted to install the stick.Also, Roku changed the remote control so that the OK button is below the arrows instead of in the center of the arrows.  When entering login information, I had to keep changing focus to find the OK button.  That change is not an enhancement.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "V J Webb"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "as described", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "easy to set up, lots of viewing options", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elizabeth J.

In no part of the description or talks does it say that not one app works outside the USA unless you use a VPN or a DNS. I have Netflix in my region but still I can't even get that. What is the sense of all this hype when it can't really be use anywhere without the use of add-ons. So not happy. Should have buy the android instead.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I couldn't be happier!  This unit is exceptional.  I've owned an original version Roku player (slow and buggy, but for its time, it opened up the streaming venue).  I have a Roku3 which is hands down a flawless device (still love the headset plug-in for its accompanied remote), and a Sony BlueRay player with streaming capabilities (also nice for the price, offers BlueRay play, and a useful but handicapped streaming ability).  For its price point, the rRoku stick now tops the list.  I've had mine for 3 months, and have noticed none of the commonly described issues: overheat issues (I use the external power supply),  nor slow response/lagging issues.  Roku has by far, more channels or \"apps\" available than any other device.  The remote is nice and solid (agree with others that the fast keys should be reprogrammable (designated Blockbuster key?  Seriously??), though I wish it had the headset port as with the Roku3.  I previously bought (and gave away) a Google Chromecast.  It didn't offer nearly enough apps/stations (I'm an iPhone user).  Guess what?  The Roku stick (and Roku3) are both able to \"cast\" from my Kindle Fire HD (otherwise a useless device, except for reading of course).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Eric \"bubagump\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It gets the job done!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "E Charles"}]
