[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "This does a good job and performs as expected.  I use Netflix, HBOGo, ESPN, and Hulu plus with the roku. Sometimes it takes a while to turn on but that is probably my internet connection.  The quality of the videos are very good.  I wish there was an AMC app or way to stream what is playing on your computer to the TV, like a chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Allison"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works like a charm!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "hector lopez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Received it in a timely manner.

Each model becoming smaller, sleeker, faster and more user friendly. The Roku 3500XB Streaming Stick is the smallest version, a hair larger than a standard USB drive.-My wife and I bought the streaming stick for our upstairs bedroom (our wireless router is downstairs). We've experienced no connectivity issues whatsoever. For people familiar with Roku devices, this is almost EXACTLY the same as the Roku2 as far as set up and loading/streaming speeds. It's not quite as speedy as the Roku3, but for $60 less, you won't notice or care.I have no idea why other reviewers complain about difficult set-up/inconvenient updates. This device is so simple to set up. Pictorial directions appear on the screen if you can't figure out how to put batteries in the remote and bush the sync button where the batteries go. Or if you can't figure out how to plug the device into the HDMI port of your television. The update took all of 2 minutes to run - and I like all updates, it's just to ensure the system is running the most up-to-date programs.Streaming Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Crackle, HBOgo, Starz along with all the major networks through this device makes cable television nearly obsolete. I love Roku products, and will continue to use them as needed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Roku only has a 90 day warranty!!!!!!!!!
