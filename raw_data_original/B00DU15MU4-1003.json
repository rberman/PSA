It was super easy to set up, a little difficult to open the battery section on the remote, & once set up has worked like a charm.  Within minutes I had numerous movies on my Watch List.

The devise is very small, hardly takes up any room on a shelf, but I have a degree of access to programs I have never had before.I have Nexfix, PBS, more television shows old and new, and of course Amazon Prime movies.

It cost much more, but it was so worth it! They are both set up the same way. I have Chromecast set upon my other TV's in my home. It did not work out for my bedroom as well. Then I watched a video comparing Roku, I Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV.
