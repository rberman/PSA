Not sure of why I get delays in the video's yet.  Very discouraging at this point.  I have a newer modem for my wireless... Seems more slow at night time.  Maybe something else is running.

I was already a Prime subscriber, so it was just a matter of opening the box, plugging it into the HDMI port on a TV, and barely a week later I've cruised through all of Alpha House and half of Transparent. Under the Dome awaits! I have seen the future, and it DOES NOT involve cable bills.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thomas L.
