I've discovered so many shows --- Power, Vikings, Key & Peele \u2013\u2013 just from using this little stick. It's a lot of fun to scan through. Very intuitive. Best of all, most shows are included with Prime. What I love most: for some reason, shows delivered through the Fire Stick have better sound than those played on my Comcast HD box. I don't know why that is, but I enjoy watching shows using the stick more so than On Demand. I also like that it's commercial free viewing. I started watching Vikings on Fire Stick. I noticed that I could watch the current season On Demand but HATE having to sit through 5 minute blocks of commercials that I can't fast forward through. With Fire Stick, I also like that the next show it cued and waiting whereas with On Demand, it's kind of a process. This is the future of TV. Once my Comcast contract is up, it's over. Fire Stick means cutting the cord and being Comcast free (except for internet).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lucille Bills"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to install.
