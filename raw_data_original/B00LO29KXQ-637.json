[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I never review products out of sheer laziness but I really like the Fire TV stick. We had been using a PS3 for streaming purchases and had come to accept it's flaws, delays, etc. In contrast the Fire TV UI is intuitive and easy to use, and the app selection is great. We only experienced lag in the first few minutes of use, and haven't had a problem since, on a 15mbps connection. I kinda kick myself for not looking into this earlier.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Damion"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This device has become my new toy.
