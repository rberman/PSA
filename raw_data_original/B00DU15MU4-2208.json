I decided to take them up on the offer because I was curious to compare the Amazon Fire to the 2 Rokus I already have.First, let me state the positives. The user interface is snappy and smooth. There's a nice selection of apps to choose from -- including some of the most important ones (i.e. Netflix, YouTube, etc.). I've actually found that the YouTube app on the Amazon Fire TV feels much better than the one on my Roku  (I don't have the Roku 3, yet). On my Roku, YouTube feels sluggish -- but it seemed to respond much better on the Fire. Netflix comes with \"Just for Kids\" and profiles, something I'm lacking on my Roku 2 (but I believe is available on Roku 3s). There's some app selections you won't find elsewhere that actually work quite well on a TV screen -- like iStoryBooks. The game selection is pretty good -- but most of the bigger games (Wolf Among Us, Walking Dead, Minecraft) require a controller.If I didn't have a Roku 2 to compare this to, I would probably rate this much higher. It was easy to set up, has a decent interface, and offers a good selection of content. However, if I'm facing the choice of upgrading to the Roku 3 or keeping the Amazon Fire TV, I'm going to go with the Roku. Let me explain why:1) Roku has more content. Roku has multiple sources to rent and buy videos. It also has multiple sources to access your Ultraviolet content (Amazon Fire can only access it via Flixster and I prefer to use Vudu). Roku also has access to a lot of other services like Redbox Instant, Fox Now, etc. that aren't available on Amazon yet. Strangely, I don't think you can even access your Amazon Cloud music from the Amazon Fire TV -- something you can do from a Roku.2) Roku allows you to search across multiple apps/channels. You can find out if a movie or TV show is available for rent or streaming with one search.3) You can use your phone/tablet as a remote for Roku (there are multiple Android and iOS apps available). Great for when you can't find the remote.4) The Roku 3 has a headphone jack in the remote for private listening.The Amazon Fire TV is nice. And if you don't care about my 1-4 list, and all you want is a way to watch Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime -- then the Fire TV is a good device and I'd recommend it. But I'm going to send mine back and get a Roku 3 instead.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "7/8", "author": "K.

Easy to set up and use. Easy to navigate and find TV shows and movies. Very good in the games department-a good library of games. Good applications that you can enjoy-Netflix, You Tube, Pandora, among others. I recommend it to anybody who loves TV shows like me and once in a while wants to de-stress with a good game. I advise to get one and enjoy TV in another way.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Miguel Figueroa"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "There are a large variety of movies, etc.  However, most of the movies are old and he new ones require a fee.
