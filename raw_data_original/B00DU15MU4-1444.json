The unit came with a 30-day trial of Amazon Prime. Since I am already a Prime Member, the unit automatically registered it to my account, so watching TV/Movies was just a matter of choosing what I wanted to watch. This was so easy and fast, that I ended up watching programs for hours. Such a pleasure in contrast to my old Roku. This afternoon I went on Amazon and downloaded some programs that were sent right to the main menu on the Fire TV.Today I listened to one of my albums from the Amazon Cloud. Very nice. When playing music I noticed the words are visible on the screen, which I find to be a bonus.One thing that would like to have available in the future is the ability to broadcast my books onto the TV so that I can listen while I work around the house, perhaps utilizing the \"Fling\" capabilities. It would also be a good idea, I think, to have this ability to the Echo as well (through B/T?). I enjoy reading, but losing eyesight. When I listen to my books on the Kindle Fire HDX tablet, it turns off if I move it or change the orientation. So I don't use this feature often.As with everything Amazon produces it comes packaged with \"class,\" and is a treat to open a mailing box and find the Amazon presentation package inside. I used to be an avid Apple user, but have drifted to Amazon and am quite pleased.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Martha Russell \"Martha Russell\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It was easy to I install, however, I didn't realize I would need to purchase another hundred dollar subscription.
