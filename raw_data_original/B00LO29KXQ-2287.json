The advertising is great, however it does not alert you for the region restrictions.Once I plugged the fire tv stick on my TV in Brazil I was surprised by the lack of apps. I knew that Prime content has region restrictions, but no excuses for applications. Any device today has the full set of apps regardless of your country, not even the simple youtube is available.The only useful app that was allowed to install is NetFlix, which does not make any difference since I have it on the samsung smartv where the stick is installed.If I had a chance I would return my order for sure, however it will cost more than the stick value for an international shipping.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Wagner"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Fire TV Stick.
