[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is an amazing product - Especially for $39.  We use it in our bedroom and it works really well.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it had 2 features:1.  The remote doesn't glow and it's more complicated than the apple TV remote.2.  I wish it had some sort of HDMI pass through.  I hate having to switch TV input away from cable.  Honestly, I understand that Amazon wants you watching their service.  But I haven't cut the cord yet, and the fact that this is on a different input actually makes me watch it less.  Which is a shame, because it's a really good product.Having said that, it's $39 - Just buy it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DanDadNJ"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Absolutely love this product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kim"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have only used it for music and HBO go at this point and have been happy for the most part.  HBO go buffered A LOT, but it may have been the website.

I Have an apple tv and I thought. Why should I get the fire stick. Well I am a prime member and they were offering a discount. What can I say, I love it. the only drawback is I cannot stream from my phone. Which would not be an issue for non-apple users. I misplaced the remote and was able to use the app on my phone and on the kindle which was great. Looking forward to them adding more apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shalaunda L Bennett \"Launda\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good media stick, have 2.
