I love the games on the Amazon Fire and the options but I feel like they tried to hard on it and it over complicated the device. It has too much cluttered and it feels very under developed. Most of the apps are fun for the first hour and the really good ones you are shelling out an extra $5 for and then realize it's not even worth it. i would recommend the Apple TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "HappyShopper \"HappyShopper\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This is a piece of junk,Amazon rushed this in to compete with Roku and didnt work out all the bugs,If the box or the stick isn,t working the remotes will quit working about the time you decide you need to change channels. go with google or Roku but save your money.If you have an older TV the fire stick will not work unless you can hoke to a computer and update your tv.Had to buy new tv for the stick.remote for fire tv box will work fine for about an hour an then quit working and will have to wait till next day before its working again.Update #1 Called Amazon and spoke with customer service and would seem that the problem with the remote for the fire tv box is a problem, was going to purchase a new remote and called to see if it would work and was told they were shipping me a new remote at no cost.Have been a customer with Amazon a long time and still would like to use there product.

We have had Kindle Fires and Kindle Paperwhites for a while, so after reading the professional reviews of the systems available I decided to go with the Fire TV because of the processor and memory it has.We've only had it for a week, but we don't miss cable at all (except that tonight for some reason the local NBC station would not come in over the Leaf antenna I bought through Amazon -- not that that has anything to do with Fire TV -- so we had to watch the Nightly News delayed via their app on the Fire TV). Together with Amazon Prime this device gives us plenty of options for evening entertainment when we're not reading or playing games on our Kindles.The only thing I was missing was live sports, so I added Sling TV via an app on the Fire TV, and all is right with the world once again.We figure we'll recoup our outlays within 2 months and then save about $75 per month thereafter.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Edward W.
