Though, fire tv stick recommends connecting to a power source, I've had no issues using my TV's USB port. Fire tv stick came configured with my amazon account. Though its new, it still needed a software update which was a surprise.When it comes to hardware, its definitely a step up from competitors like Roku Stick and Chromecast. Dual Core CPU and dual band Wifi is a great plus.Dedicated remote is a great plus as you don't have to look at the remote and use the physical buttons with little practice unlike chromecast where you have to pick up your phone, unlock and open the app to control it. Remote is simple and fast; however the click wheel is not as well designed an apple tv remote which has a depression where your finger naturally rests and feels good, but its definitely not a deal breaker.I felt that UI is definitely better compared to Roku and the voice search feature in the android app is definitely very helpful.Mirroring and flinging videos from phone/tablets is not intuitive and easy as compared to Chromecast. I had to pair the youtube app on the fire tv stick to my phone's youtube for it to get listed in the cast-able devices list on youtube. However, once paired, casting was flawless and worked quite well.Plex works well; allcast can be side loaded as do some of the other apps. Future potential, considering its hardware, really looks good.For anyone invested in amazon's ecosystem, there's really no reason not to consider Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Abhi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to set up and use.

I probably would not have purchased it at list price, but Best Buy had a great deal going a few weeks ago so I grabbed one.  It works great, is fairly easy to set up, and provides more than enough free content to waste most of your waking hours with.

Firstly,  super easy setup and works within 5 minutes.  Secondly,  if you're a Prime member you can watch movies,  tv and listen to music for free.  Also, the fact that it not limited to one tv. You can move it around,  even take it on the go. Lastly, it even has games. I got mine for $20. Awesome!
