I came from a PS3, Xbox One, and Apple TV set up. Fire TV Stick is easy to set up and works well. I wish it were possible to customize the interface a bit, but for what it is I'm pretty happy with it considering the price. Netflix lost my log in, but that's probably because I'm powering the Stick with my TV's USB instead of the provided power adapter. I'll probably keep testing it. I think $39 is pushing it a bit for this device. But under $30 and this is a solid deal. I bought two for $20 each when it first came out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jack"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Pre-ordered, being a Kindle Fire fan and a Prime member. Did not even mind the expectation that the the programming would focus on Amazon Prime offers.... HOWEVER, the CHANNELS offered are very limited. My Roku stick has HUNDREDS of channels to choose from, including scores of FREE channels, not offered by the Fire TV Stick. I'm giving it to a friend; it's fine and friendly but no reason to keep it; Roku is still the best on the market.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Dale Milford"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Real Buyer"}]
