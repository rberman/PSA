Feels and acts like any Smart TV menu, but has a lot more options than my Sony Network options.  The primary reason I got this device is to watch ESPN on my Sony 4K TV, and after some initial lag, ESPN comes through just fine.  The free stuff (apps, games) included with Fire TV will keep you occupied for hours.I'm sitting about 10 feet from my TV, and the Fire Stick is plugged into the back of my 55\" with the included 6\" extender (to try to get better connectivity to my router and remote).There is a noticeable lag (~.3 seconds) on the remote and sometimes the cursor skips sporadically (moves 2-3 spots instead of 1 or doesn't move at all).  It's so bad, you can't play a SERIOUS game of PBA Bowling (\"I'm perfectly, calm, Dude.\").  I still can't get this device to register with my 5.8 ghz network (I register 3 of 4 bars on the network, but the Stick won't authenticate the network).  It connects to the 2.4 ghz network just fine.For $20 (Prime pre-sale), I won't raise a stink.  But now that games are off the table, I wonder if the Fire TV is any better for the extra money.  I'm nervous to try out the joystick on the Fire Stick, and likely won't now.PROSInexpensive.It makes any TV \"Smart\".Entertainment for the whole family.CONSNetwork connectivity.Remote function.Believes in nihilism.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "J.

Watched some tv shows and it paused to load more than 4 times per episode. Twice it was so bad the streaming stopped and I had to press play again. It is less than 10 feet from the Wi-Fi access and other devices are working fine.

You were able to take advantage of the $19 offer for the Fire Stick.  $19!!!!Without the two above I believe the Roku Steaming stick's vastly superior content makes it a wiser choice.  In my case, the Time Warner Cable channel on the Roku units (and NOT available on the Fire Stick or Fire TV) is the deal breaker.  I have two TV's with Roku units and no cable boxes.  The money I've saved by not having to pay renting the cable boxes has already paid for the Roku's.I have the Fire Stick installed on a seldom used TV in a guest bedroom.  Because I paid $19 for the Fire Stick, and I am a Prime subscriber, I am more than happy with its performance in this environment.If Amazon ever adds a TWC app to the Fire Stick it would become a Five Star device on TV's I use daily.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mr. Luigi"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Ordered 2, both do not work.  The first one briefly shows colored vertical lines on the screen then the screen goes blank.

No problems from any of my other devices, but these Firetv sticks suck, won't be recommending them to anyone.
