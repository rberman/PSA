[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I really wanted to like this and I tried my hardest, but there is no way. This is garbage, pure and simple. Unfortunately, I have two and neither works with any reliability. The unit can go through periods where it will not respond at all to the remote, then suddenly the Fire Stick will go nuts and you've accomplished nothing. Trying to program the Fire Sticks initially should have told me to send them back, they took almost an hour apiece.One you get everything set up and finally working, you still have to deal with the terrible remote to Fire Stick communication. Want to rewind? Good for you. We'll let you stop when we feel like it. You may wind up at the beginning of the show.Do not bother with this if you have a crappy ISP like Tine Warner. I have no choice, so I'm stuck. Whenever the internet goes out, you may have to wait for the Fire Stick to reconnect. This could be seconds, it could be minutes. Have a book handy. Again, you may be stuck with the non-responsive Fire Stick in the middle of this.Hopefully Amazon will develop a version with less suck and more responsiveness.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "David"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It was average experience nothing so good about it.

For that it does work pretty well. Amazon Prime Videos stream fine. But I am disappointed with my third reason for purchase MLB.com. I get frequent buffering and dropped signals. My other devices all run MLB fine on the same network in the same room (laptop, ipad and Android phone). It has to be a problem with the device working with this app. I can't recommend this product if you are primarily purchasing it to use with a MLB.com subscription.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bill Yates \"Bill\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really enjoy streaming shows now!!
