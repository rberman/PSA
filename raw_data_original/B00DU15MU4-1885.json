It does stream extremely well however, looks sleek and nice and has a bad @s$ remote with the voice search.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael Battista"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "buying a box to pay to watch stuff that's free on netflix? I feel like an idiot. You get more with netflix without buying a box. Paying 3.99 to rent old movies is crazy. I can go 1/4 mile down the street and rent from redbox ( a new release) for $1.30. Come on amazon get it together, expand your free library to compete with netflix and hulu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/7", "author": "ezbanshee"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great I like it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "desmond thomas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I'm not here to write a book. It's freak'n AMAZING! I have an Apple TV, Roku, Chrome, Sony Blu-ray with apps and Samsung Smart TV. This thing blows them all out of the water, especially for the price.It's FAST and the picture is not a little, a LOT better then all the others. It isn't even close.There are little issues here and there, but Fire TV software seems to be evolving and improving, so I don't see any reason why I'd worry that they won't be eventually addressed. Mature Netflix has a better browsing/favoriting system, Apple TV has a more intuitive, easier interface. Roku is no longer a contender, Chrome just blows.  So, let's give Amazon Fire TV some time to catch up and hope they concentrate on the right things, my guess is they will.Setup was so easy I don't even remember it. Voice control has worked perfectly for me every time. Love that the remote is not infrared (no more pointing!), now I wish all my remotes were the same way.I was disappointed it wasn't set up for AirPlay, but after some searching I found the app \"AirPlay/DLNA Receiver PRO\" on Amazon's app store and it seems to work perfectly, so job-done. I've enjoyed all the apps I've downloaded so far.I've pre-ordered the Fire TV Stick and until something leap-frogs them, I'm sticking with Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "The Great Buzzwami \"Buzz\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "How do you shut the Darn thing off???????

I do like what's available and the functionality. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is they really screwed up on not making this compatible with a bluetooth keyboard. Apple does this, Amazon doesn't. With all of those passwords, it's an urgent requirement. There may be a keyboard that works, but it is specialized.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jeffrey \"jbro\""}]
