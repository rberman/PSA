We loved our Fire TV in the living and the Fire TV Stick works just like it. We use our Fire TV Stick in our bedroom and it works wonderfully. My wife recently stole the Fire Stick for a business trip and wants to buy another just for traveling. She had access to all her Amazon Prime and Netflix shows without opening her laptop. It is better to watch on a 42\" hotel screen than your 13\" laptop. Only down side it does not do everything the Fire TV box does, but most of those extras we hardly use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Merv"}]
