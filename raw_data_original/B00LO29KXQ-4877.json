I had been looking for something that would allow me to view Amazon Instant Prime Videos, Netflix, and Showtime Anytime, with out having to switch between 3 different devices. And the choice of things to watch, is amazing! Now, if only some service,other than cable (or going with an over-the-air antenna ), would offer my local channels, I could really reduce my cable bill!!Thanks Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susan Blackmer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rufus Simmons"}]
