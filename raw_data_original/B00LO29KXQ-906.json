[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Woo hoo. I can't believe I missed out on streaming for this long. SInce its my first time with this I decided to try out the stick vs the tv. The stick is definetly the right choice for me. I hate using voice controls (awkward talking to an inanimate object) so I do not need this function. Setting up was literally just pluggin in the little stick. I already have youtube and hulu accounts so I just simply logged myself in and started watching tv. The wait time for each load is not particularly long. I have an older computer for watching videos so the load time is just slightly same or less.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bunny"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it, makes using the internet on TV so easy", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rachel Senyitko"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I was very pleased. I found it extremely easy to set up. It's a must for a Prime customer. You can easily watch your Prime shows or listen to your Prime music through your tv.  I found the Fire Stick apps much simpler to use than the apps on my Blueray or tv. The interface is smoother and simpler to navigate.I would have given 5 stars but I feel that the claim that you have all these shows and movies, is a bit misleading since you do have to be a subscriber to most of these companies that the apps represent, in order to watch the tv shows and movies.Please consider changing the wording. Also, the way some tvs are set up, it would be better to have the power cord, connect to the bottom of the stick instead of on the side.Overall, I loved this and would recommend it to my friends and family.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paula H"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So much better than our Chromecast because the remote is very easy to use, and having Amazon and Netflix available on the same device is great.

It works great wherever we have a wireless internet connection.  Happy I gave it a shot during Amazon's July black-Friday thing (even if most of the deals were lame...this deal worked out!)  If you don't have a smart TV with integrated Netflix or Amazon Prime or a host of other aps....this will work for you.  I haven't seen the Google or Apple products...so can't compare.  But for $25, I'm a happy camper.  *Get it?  I use it in my RV...happy camper.
