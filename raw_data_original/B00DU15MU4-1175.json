Fairly easy to hook up. Would be helpful if the navigation ring had arrows. Some negatives, when trying to register some of the apps, Comcast is not listed as a provider choice. Also, have not been able to get the mirroring to work. Have ordered the gaming unit, but is a long wait.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Butch"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really nice unit.
