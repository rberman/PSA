[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I can't imagine why I waited so long to buy the Fire TV Stick. I absolutely love it. It is easy to install and use. I am enjoying the movies and especially the documentary series. My grandkids love the kids and family selections. My granddaughter who just turned three uses the remote to choose her favorite Kipper and Barney programs. I can't stop recommending it to family and friends.
