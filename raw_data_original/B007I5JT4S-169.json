[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This guy is great.  It's primarily used for Netflix, but we also use it for Apple AirPlay from our MacBooks, which is convenient if we want to watch a video but don't want to get up to plug our laptop into the TV via HDMI.  Love all Apple products and this one works great with the rest of them.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MakingReviewsonAmazon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Thanks for the added note.
