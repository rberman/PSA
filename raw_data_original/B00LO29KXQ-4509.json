This will soon stop after my dissatisfaction with finding this product, ordering this product, and then not being able to use this product.I have been trying to purchase this product for months because I love Amazon.  I was excited to choose a product they created thinking it would be as wonderful as my experiences had been with the company.  I was wrong!I looked on the Amazon site for months and it was constantly sold out.  Finally, I decided to order it through Best Buy which was an even bigger hassle because most stores don't have it in stock.  It must be ordered and shipped.  I waited at home to receive my shipment later than promised and then traveled off to work out of town.  I stay in hotels and surprisingly the hotel in this tiny town has terrible cable.  I ordered this product, waited for it, and finally was ready to use it only to find out that it wouldn't connect to the network.  I tried to use the chat feature to resolve my issue and found out that the fire tv department only offers support through out going calls.  They called me only to tell me that there was no resolution to my problem.  This PORTABLE steaming video player will not play on a network that requires authentication.  One of the biggest selling points is the size and thus portability of this product!  That really doesn't help if you can't use it outside of your home!I have had a roku for probably 5 years now.  I have bought them for friends and family because the product was so wonderful.  I should have stuck with what worked and purchased another roku.  The newer ones are flash drive size as well.  I really thought Amazon would offer a superior product though so I went for it!  DO NOT buy this product!  It is not worth the hassle!  The competitors products work as well if not better and are of comparable prices!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Melissa Tisdale"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This device totally lived up to my expectations! It was very easy to set up; plug it in the HDMI port of the HD tv and just follow the instructions on the screen. The device updated itself right away and started up with displaying it's home screen. Before we watched prime movies on Sony blue-ray dvd but because we have  DSL for internet we had a hard time watching movies in the evening. We could hardly watch Netflix. This device is perfect, we almost never lose signal and watching Amazon prime and Netflix is a smooth experience. I personally like that we can listen to my amazon music and look at the photos and records from the cloud on the big screen. The home screen is very easy to navigate. The only stumble was to insert the battery in the remote. It took me a few moments to figure out how to open the battery chamber. It is small but a very powerful streaming device which I would highly recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Anna"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very easy to set up and works very well so far with very little lag time.

At first I wasn't sure it would work as promised. However I went with the majority of the reviews and have to say it is absolutely a great device. I have seen in some of the reviews that people have streaming issues. One thing I can say is that I have seen only a couple of \"stutters\" in the 10 plus movies and tv shows I have watched from Amazon Prime. One great addition I love about it is the ability to side load apps. I have put Kodi on it and now can steam my movies from my NAS to my bedroom tv. In the past I have relied on various streaming programs and have felt all have an interface that is too complicated. The interface for Kodi it nice and easy. Having said that I love the interface of the Fire stick itself. It is very user friendly and setup was breeze. I have mine connected to my Wireless N hot spot which is about 80 feet away and I have no connection issues. I know I have has problems with ISP provided wireless routers, they have been less that reliable. I would recommend getting a good wireless N router. If you have playback issues I would look to see if the problem is with the service you are using or the WiFi connection itself. I can steam local media over my network with no stutters of any kind and it wall works great. So I know the stutters have to do with the data coming from my ISP which I have no control over. All in all I would highly recommend this device to anyone who is looking to stream online content plus the ability to stream local media. If you are going to hook this unit up to your main TV I would probably go with the Fire TV box as it has the ability for a hard connection, but for a secondary TV like in a bedroom the Fire Stick is perfect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Keith G.

Good Will Hunting) and there are few of them, while the bad movies that I wouldn't ever choose to watch are plentiful.  The recent movies are less than you would pay in the cinema but still pricey enough that I will wait to watch those.  I will be interested to see if they become available later on.  Sometimes while watching, the video will stop and a message comes up saying there isn't enough bandwidth.  We sit while the video is fluffing and then it will begin to play after several minutes.  This can happen multiple times during the show.  This can be frustrating but CD's from Netflix have scratches that make it skip scenes and having to rewind is more of a bother than sitting patiently letting the video gather more bandwidth.  Overall, I feel this was a good purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Holley B."}]
