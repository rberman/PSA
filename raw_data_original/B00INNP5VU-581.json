But, I'm a little disappointed in the programming.  There's a lot of channels, but many are the same, they just come from different providers.  I was looking for older movies, but most of the older movies I found are B movies. I'm still looking though, so maybe I'll find something.

Easy to install and set up was fast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jackie Wattson"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Pros:Small in designStays HiddenDoesn't have to plug into the wall if you have USB on your TVCons:Slow to bootupFirmware needs updating right out of boxSometimes restarts randomlyApps seem to need to catch up on their stream more often than their primary source (may not be roku, may be the app)I bought this in order for my fiancee and I to be able to watch HBO in our bedroom. Since then, I have used it to watch live streams of E3 and also watch Major League Soccer through the MLS app. I really like the convenience of being able to move the roku about between rooms without any hassle, since I don't have to unplug anything from the wall or deal with long cords. It's extremely convenient.I do have a few issues with the device however. My primary issue is how long it takes for the device to bootup. There's been quite a few times where I'm running really close to the beginning of the game starting and having to wait a few minutes (literally a few minutes sometimes) for the device to get running is frustrating.The other issues I have tend to be firmware issues and I'm sure that they'll be fixed over time. But, as some other reviews note, it's a tad annoying that it needs a firmware update directly out of the box. It seems as though the firmware glitches every once in a while, causing the entire unit to randomly reboot, leading to more frustration as you are, again, waiting for it to come back up. Often with MLS streams it will need to rebuffer, yet the MLS Live stream on my laptop (same game) does not need to rebuffer. Not sure if this is because of the MLS app (very well could be) or because the Streaming Stick isn't fast enough to deal with the app.I can't compare it with the Google Chromecast, but the reason I bought this over the Chromecast is because the Roku had more apps available to it as of the time when I purchased it.I do like the convenient direction that Streaming devices are going, and it's just a matter of time until the streaming sticks are just as fast as the more conventional box-top options.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dan S"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Nowhere in the packaging or on the box nor on the Amazon site does it say that Netflix is ONLY available in US, Canada and UK.  In fact, the product description says: \"Send to TV from mobile. With apps from Netflix and YouTube, cast videos from your smartphone or tablet straight to your TV.\"  I pay for my netflix subscription and I can access it just fine from the Dominican Republic.  Roku Customer Service is a joke.  They make you wait for 30 minutes for a chat and then they claim they do not sell outside of the US, Canada or UK nor do they offer their services outside these countries. Then how in the HE double hockey sticks, do I own this piece of garbage in the first place?  I ordered it with an international credit card with an international address.
