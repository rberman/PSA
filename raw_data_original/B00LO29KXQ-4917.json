I will also mention that as a direct result i cannot use most of the features of this device. No Amazon Video, no Hulu, no HBO or Showtime. No Pandora or Amazon Music. This thing is solely for Netflix, Youtube, Vimeo, TuneIn and the handful of entertaining apps i am allowed to install or use. But these apps don't work perfectly either, just well enough. Netflix has a weird audio sync issue with its programming. Youtube has it as well. Sound is delayed by .5 to 1 second. There are no instructions on what i should tweak on my TV if its a compatability issue.Pros:\u25cfThe wifi works well\u25cfApps load and work really fast\u25cfRemote ontrol is responsive enough to play a few games really well\u25cfsetup was a breezeCons:\u25cbRegional restrictions on content (even on Amazon created content)\u25cbAnnoying sound synchronisation issues.\u25cbSleep function is hidden away in submenu\u25cbLack of a digital manual (or do I need to look again? I may have missed it)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I subscribe to Amazon Prime and Netflix.

It constantly disconnects from my home wifi network causing disruptions in my viewing experience. My google chromecast never disconnects and works so much better.
