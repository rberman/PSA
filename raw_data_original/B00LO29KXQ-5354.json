[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Eliminates the need for cable, especially when you are not a big TV viewer and you watch mostly online content. I love that I can use my TV and not my laptop for Netflix and Amazon movies....and YouTube. I like it better than my Apple TV first generation, because I have way more choices with the stick, and it is so small and easy to connect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carolyne P.

Extremely fast. Great picture. It's like getting an instantaneous, first-class film and tv collection. Set-up was dirt simple. Performance is beyond expectation. Fire TV Stick rules. Best deal ever seen at this price. So, now go get HBO on board and you're up for canonization!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JonBear"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Well i have many devices from cell phones to Rokus connected to my wireless network.  However the Fire TV stick has to be next to the Wi-Fi router in order for it to work.  Yes I tried the HD extender as well as changing the settings on the router, but nothing works.  I have two Rokus and I love them.  Easy to use interface and never a problem connecting to my Wi-Fi.  Don't waste your money on the Fire TV Stick ... get a Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Tom Murphy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

First movie played about halfway & quit. Called & they had no idea what to do so if all else fails, disconnect power from stick, pull stick out from TV, then reconnect. Stick was very hot. They didn't know why. It reconnected to finish movie. Haven't used it since.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Mary Johnson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Drew Crafton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this item. Simple to connect to TV and was already set up with my account information. Once setup you can take the Fire TV stick from TV to TV with no set up required, just connect and start enjoying your prime. Received for Christmas, I have not tried any of the apps yet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is my first streaming stick and I am satisfied. I have long considered getting an apple TV or a Roku, but jumped on this because of the price and because I am a prime member. I have found the menus easy to navigate with the included remote and the quality of the picture and sound is good. Overall, this is a more enjoyable way to watch amazon prime movies than hooking up my laptop to the TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.
