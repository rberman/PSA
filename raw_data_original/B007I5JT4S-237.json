[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome little thing!  I didn't know to much about apple tv and other things like it.  But I bought this for the break room at my restaurant for all the employees to enjoy something to watch during their break.  So far, everyone loves it, it gives them access to everything that is extremely entertaining!  Especially when they only have a 30 minute break.  Also love the design, super sleek and runs very fast.  Very pleased with this product.  One of these days ill have to try amazon fire tv and see how it compares :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jared F."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Another great Apple product.
