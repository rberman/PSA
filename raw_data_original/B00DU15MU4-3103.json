[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "My hope is someone from Amazon will read this. The issue with this market is similar to the protected digital video content market where everyone does something different rather than having one system. These devices make hat market easier by supporting content from multiple sources, but none let you search for content from all sources. e.g. I search for Avengers and it finds that I own it and can play my owned copy from the following sources.This device seems to do what Roku does, but with support for far fewer services. HBO Go and Vudu are some of the ones missing for my use.This device and Roku lack support for local media streaming. UPnP/DLNA support is a must. Another is support for local file sharing with support for SMB/CIFS, AFP and NFS. This kind of support and support for many codecs has kept me with the WDTV. My issues with the WDTV are no Amazon Video support and the latest model is a bit slow, the local file sharing does not work as consistently as the old version and you can't specify a hostname or IP for the file server.I understand that Apple will likely not ever allow streaming from any of their services from other devices, but excluding Apple I, like many others, want to have the one box that does it all. Roku is probably the closest, but it lacks local media support.Given that Intel NUC based systems are very cheap with Core i3 CPUs and not that much for versions with i5 and i7, I would be fine paying for $200 - $350 for something with that power that could have a front end like this device, Roku, WDTV, etc. and that could run windows to provide an iTunes interface. I realize this is out there, but then if someone would have described many of the devices we have now years before they came out and changed our digital world, people would have said the same thing then.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "12/46", "author": "Chris M"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I used the Sony Network Media Player and this is by far the the best.  The Sony is a snail compared to this.  That and the fact that the Voice activation is easy enough my 4 year old can play Frozen over and over with out my help.  Pandora, Netflix, all have great interface.  Only complaint is option to start a movie or TV show from beginning is not available but I'm sure it will in an update soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "NWFlyboy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This review is based on only a weekend of having the device. I'll see about updating as I get more time and experience.I've owned Apple TV, android sticks, Chromecast and Roku. All have their strengths and weaknesses. At the risk of being skewered I don't really know what the utility of my Chromecast is other than watching Youtube or Netflix. For me I was looking specifically for a device I could mount on the back of my TV in my garage/gym. I needed to be able to control it with a remote and have an interface that actually worked. This pretty much left Roku and Apple TV. Apple TV is too restrictive in its offerings and Roku doesn't seem to get along with Comcast. I was hoping that Fire TV would provide the best of all worlds. It almost does.The Good:- It's a handsome and compact device but deceivingly heavy.- The remote works great and does not require line of sight.- I have not really worked a lot with the voice recognition but it seems to work OK.- Amazon Prime support is great and mine came preloaded with my account information.- The interface is quick, intuitive and very well though out.- Playback of video is surprisingly quick even over wireless.The OK:- Netflix support is good with an interface that rivals that of my PS3 and Roku.- Does not come with an HDMI cable.The Bad:- No HBOGo- No Xfinity App- Slight intermittent stuttering with Netflix. This manifests as a frozen frame every minute or so when watching. It honestly ins't very noticeable or annoying but it is there with mine.Conclusion:I'm sticking with it and am very impressed overall. I really hope that all the apps that are available for the Kindle Fire end up available for this thing. Notably the HBOGo and Xfinity.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Chris S."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "So my Roku 2 XS is on its last leg, it reboots 3 to 4 times a night due to I assume memory overload then it freezes and the rest is history. So I going to buy a Roku 3, but Amazon TV came out recently so I figured I would give that a test drive instead, since I consider myself a pretty big Amazon fan-boy. Overall, I am underwhelmed, it's a great product for someone just breaking into the Streaming Media Box, way of watching movies and TV. However, for someone who is experienced will realize that this box was designed for Amazon content and nothing else.Speed:According to the product page, the new Amazon Fire TV boasts a whopping 2 gig of Ram, quadrupling anything on the market. And certainly dwarfing the 256 MB my Roku 2 XS has. However, besides Amazon content, there is zero difference in the processing speeds between the Roku 2 XS and Amazon Fire TV, when it comes to Apps like Hulu, or Netflix.Content:The content is dismal at this point, Roku definitely has Amazon beat, which seems strange as you would think Amazon would have had developers beta testing this box long before release to have a vast library available on release. Likewise, the default content is Amazon content, Apps have to be entered through a special screen. However, Amazon content nearly fills up the entire screen with show promos and suggested content. Roku has them beat with their simplistic layout.Search Function:The intuitive search feature works surprisingly well, unfortunately it defaults to VoD style programs and hides Netflix, Hulu and Prime behind a \"More ways to View\" button. It seems like a pretty sneaky ploy to get you to pay per episode or movie, rather than provide you a means to watch it for free, prior to buying it (e.g. link you to prime eligible movies and movies on other services than defaulting to paying for it).Hardware:The box is slightly larger in surface area than the Roku or Apple TV, but not quite as tall, so it is pretty much a wash. It looks nice next to your current hardware. Likewise, it has digital audio port, USB port and Ethernet, which can be often times a premium on the other systems. However, the current specs are not lining up to what they have promised, hopefully with patches, they will be able to streamline their apps to be on par with how quickly the box processes Amazon products.I am going to keep the box for 2 to 3 weeks to see if it improves, however as it stands right now. I will be returning this box for a Roku 3.*Edit* I will change this review at the end of the 3 weeks to update my final opinion, I also plan on purchasing the game pad so I can test out the games next week.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Carlos"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Like it a lot. Bottom line is, you can't get many of the apps available on the Amazon Fire on Apple TV. That said, some of the features need tweaking. For example, when fast forwarding or rewinding a program you cannot track the action on screen. Instead, the picture is frozen at the point of playback and you have to guess when to stop FF or RW.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mark Cohen"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The voice search really should search within all the apps that are offered.

I've tried Apple TV, Chromecast, and numerous other streaming solutions so I thought that if it was slightly faster than those others I would be satisfied. FireTV is fast, I mean really fast. Instead of buffering for minutes it was a few seconds for a movie to load on Netflix and when I wanted to skip past opening and ending credits of shows it was just as fast to load the thumbnails for the very well spaced intervals. Also the remote was very intuitive and easy to use. I'm not sure I'm sold on the gaming, but for the streaming it's what I wanted and a whole lot more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Patrick E Lo"}]
