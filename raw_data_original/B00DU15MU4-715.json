I needed to purchase this in order to use my new SlingTV service.... and the service is not working very well. For this reason, I'm not 100% sure if the more serious issues I'm experiencing are related to Sling....or the Fire TV box.  I'm getting lots of buffering, dropping of programs and freeze-ups. I've yet to make through an entire program or sporting event without grabbing the remote and reloading the program.  It's quite frustrating. I suspect it is a combination of both really.  My internet connection is quite fast (already double-checked that), so the issue is not with my service.  On another note...one thing that I don't like is how the Amazon Cloud drive organizes my photos (NOTHING is in alphabetical order) and there is a bit of waiting for things to load.  Of course, this may not be the function of FireTV so much as the Amazon Prime TV service.  After all, it happens from wherever I'm accessing it, not just the TV equipped with my FireTV box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Spauld"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.
