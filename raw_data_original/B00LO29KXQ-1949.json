[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "If you are thinking of buying one of these, I would wait until they work some of the kinks out of them and here is why.  I bought two Firesticks  a couple weeks ago and I am very disappointed in their performance. At first,they performed very well but within a matter of a week, they began to consistently  reboot during streaming a movie. Even after I removed all the apps that I had downloaded in my excitement when I first got them, the problem continues. Therefore, I am wishing I did not get rid of the boxes they came in or I'd send them back!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amy's"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It does what amazon says it does. I discovered that amazon instant video has shows and movies that even Netflix or Hulu plus doesn't have so that's a plus.

Roku is easier to use, has more features and more programs already on it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Danny Hitchcox"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This is the biggest piece of junk I've ordered from Amazon. I purchased them during the initial buy in pre-order and didn't open it until Christmas. This thing hasn't worked right from the start. I continue to lose connection to my wifi. I have to restart the unit or go into the settings and \"forget\" the network and sign in again. The unit then starts working again. This is annoying and there is no fix for it. I have read that other people have had similar problems with this device. I do not have any issues with my phone, computer, or tablet running the same network. I haven't had any issues with my ROKU or Chromecast running on the same network. I can't recommend this product at any price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bjorn Erickson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Amazon Fire TV Stick.  I wanted to use it in conjunction with my NetFlix account and had a little trouble getting the two services to sync.  But, the telephone tech support from Amazon was pleasant, professional and effective.  I was up and running in very little time with NetFlix AND a whole world of other options.
