I did encounter problems at first because it would not stay connected to my wi-fi router.  Amazon tech support pleasantly surprised me when they called me within five minutes of my online request for help.  I spent several minutes on the phone with the first and second line support personnel unable to clear the problem.  The tech believed the cause was interference in my wireless environment and suggested I ask my ISP to set my router to a specific channel versus automatic mode.  After doing that, I continued to have slow connection and disconnect errors.  I finally moved my TV Stick to a different TV and it worked!.  I moved it back to the original TV but plugged it into a different HDMI port and that cured the problem.  Streaming is now strong and uninterrupted.  My TV is a 22\" Seiko (a very off brand, I'm sure).  So...my advice to those who may encounter problems with the Stick is to try a different HDMI port or a different TV before even calling tech support.  Additionally, although the signals environment was not the cause of my problem, I found that there are some free apps out there for your smart phone or PC that will display your wi-fi environment to help you find sources of interference, e.g., \"Acrylic Wi-Fi Free.\"", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Strathmore \"John\""}]
