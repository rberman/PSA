The images of the Fire TV Stick in use do not show a power cord being necessary so it is implied that it is wireless...this is not the case and we will likely be returning this.

The remote is super easy to use. Parental controls. Lots of apps. The one downside, which is why I give it three stars, is that one of the main reasons I bought it was for the Showtime Anytime. We have Showtime on our main floor, but we do not have a box for cable upstairs. The Fire TV Stick does not support two of the biggest providers of TV programming, Xfinity and DirecTV with Showtime Anytime, making this feature, which was a BIG selling point (outside of the Prime) for us, useless.....I find it hard to believe that it is not a supported device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Leslie \"new mom\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent device! Setup was easy. The remote is a great accessory. Also, controlling the Fire TV Stick with the mobile app is pretty awesome! Would I choose this over a Chromecast? Not sure.

It was very simple to install and I had it fully function with the latest updates with in minutes of installing the device.  I have not played any games with it yet and probably wont but think it's a nice feature.  I like the dongle extender to make attaching the device to the HDMI port easier on some models.  I think the power cord needs to be longer. Four feet is not long enough and I am exploring some options to get a cable of 9 to 12 feet long.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shannon Michaels"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works as advertised...

With the Fire TV Stick, you'll be in Amazon's ecosystem and can not browse content off your non Fire OS device and and \"Cast\" it to your tv. That's what really slick about Chromecast. I've had this for 2 days now and the only thing I use it for is to watch my Prime videos (which I also have for Google TV for, but this is much easier). I tried playing a couple games, but most of them are just cheaply developed games that you can get for you smart device anyways.Yes, there's a remote control app available for non Fire OS devices, but I found the swiping for up and down kind of annoying. Paired with a Fire OS device, this will probably work better. Amazon will probably never release a stand alone app for their ecosystem for other platform, so if you want the best experience, you'll have to buy into their ecosystem.....which means re-purchasing all your apps, movies, music, etc....I bought the PLEX app for Android devices, I'm not going to buy it again.I'm just so used to casting my phone apps and content to Chromecast that I don't think I can get used to the Fire TV stick because it feels like Google TV, which I didn't like at all. Is it a Chromecast Killer? No. If you're ingrained into Amazon, you'll probably like more than me.Short and simple.....If you have Fire OS devices, it's worth a try. If not, stick to Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Toua Yang"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy to set up, works great.
