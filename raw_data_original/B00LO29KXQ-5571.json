I had the opportunity to get this at a good discount, so I jumped at it. Call it the \"Gary Busey\" factor, I guess.Shortly after arriving, it was banished to the seldom-used downstairs television. It's great for Amazon shows, but we enjoy Netflix as well. Although I can understand why Amazon's product is set up this way, I do not like the user interface for Netflix or basically anything that is not Amazon. While you can scroll through Amazon's offerings with ease, Netflix is sort of a hodge-podge of shows you can watch if you have time to sift through them. So much of the standard search/recently watched/categories are just simply missing on Fire TV's Netflix interface, to the point where it screams \"Amazon Fire TV - watch Amazon Prime movies! Listen to your music! Do everything Amazon! Also, here is Netflix, if you just 'have' to have it.\" Don't get me wrong, if Netflix had their own device, they'd do the same thing. It's not like you want to help out your competition any.Amazon's content is large and visible with this device, easily searchable and cataloged - the whole nine.When you're using the Netflix app, it's hard to see what you're looking at. A huge picture on top and the shows below are too small for me to see well. I can't hardly tell what show I'm selecting.In short, if you are all about talking to your remote and all about Amazon Prime, then this is a good deal. If you have kids that are addicted to Netflix content, I'd go with something else.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

But I have to say the stick is kind of disappointing in the sense that it is really slow. There is a lot of lag from the time I press a button and I see the icon selected on the screen move. It's even worse while using Youtube.It constantly gets disconnected from my wi-fi while my phones and laptop do not have any issues with connectivity to internet.I really hope the Amazon Fire TV module is faster than this Fire TV stick.
