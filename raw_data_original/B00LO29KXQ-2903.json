Disconnect cable. Keep Internet. Hello fire stick. I rarely watch tv. It's mainly for my 3 year old to watch cartoons. In which it has everything she watches. If u stay on \"prime tv\" it's all free. It will show u what is available if u are a prime member. You'd be stupid NOT to subscribe to prime. But that's just my opinion. I love it and I've gotten 2 others to drop their providers and go to strictly this too.
