I like that I have access to Amazon Prime movies and Netflix but all of the other services also require a subscription.  It kind of defeats the purpose of having the device, you might as well pay for cable.  I dislike that I don't have access to you tube or any other Google services (should have read the fine print and done more research).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aspen Shanti"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It is a great piece of hardware. No stuttering, no lag. My only complaint, and it's not really a fire issue, is there is no Vudu app and as such a glaring whole in the line up. Once that is filled it's a five star solution. As an aside, if Amazon supported ultraviolet this could be remedied as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mr. T"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the Voice Search, and trust me IT WORKS!!

I am still getting used to the remote control, sometimes you want to rewind and turn off captions and sometimes it works well on Amazon Prime but not to well on Hulu Plus.Now, this is our upgrade from a Roku which we still like very much!Last thing, please Amazon, stop with the rivalry, let us add the Google Play app on the Fire!! I have tons of stuff there too and it would be nice to just use one streamer instead of Roku and Fire.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Gaia321"}]
