Easy to use!  You can bring it anywhere to share your movies, TV shows and videos! You can even cast videos from your phone, take videos of family, friends, or anything and play them on your big screen tv! The only downside is that you can not use this item with all websites, for example you can not readily cast all YouTube videos.  That small issue does in no way take away from how amazing this device is! Highly recommend!!!","helpfulness":"0/0"},{"author":"William Chadwick","rating":5,"verified":true,"review":"Love my music and videos and movies and I got say this is the best thing I ever bought for streaming media off my phone love it to death and plan to buy another one for the tv in the bedroom and I highly recommend it if your looking at a streaming device for you android phone","helpfulness":"0/0"},{"author":"Jean Lee","rating":3,"verified":true,"review":"Sometimes internet connection is not good even though wifi is okay...anyway I like it","helpfulness":"0/0"},{"author":"Henry Cintron Lamboy","rating":5,"verified":true,"review":"Very good","helpfulness":"0/0"},{"author":"David H.","rating":2,"verified":true,"review":"I don't know if this even deserves two stars. I am into the Apple ecosystem, but wanted to use it with Chrome and Windows. Compared to a Roku stick or AppleTV, this is pure garbage.","helpfulness":"1/1"},{"author":"jose vargas","rating":5,"verified":true,"review":"Very good","helpfulness":"0/0"},{"author":"C.

Heckel \"Frog\"","rating":1,"verified":false,"review":"Being a retired IT manager for HP, I think this product sucks hugely. It's not easy, it takes multiple re-boots, it fails to work properly as advertised and is a pos. Couple this with Prime and you have a nice package called customer lunacy. Don't try this with a wifi. Don't try this on your home network. Save the money and buy something that works. I've spent countless hours trying to simply watch my Prime, so now it's time to cut loose the stupid tech shackles that bind my wallet and go for something that works void of me having to trouble shoot it every time I use it.","helpfulness":"0/0"},{"author":"Andres Q.","rating":5,"verified":true,"review":"Works for what I need it too !

The Chromecast has opened my family up to a while new world of entertainment.  Yeah maybe it has less features than Apple tv or Roku.  For the cost it is amazing, has never let us down, and I really enjoy streaming from my phone to the t.v. easily.  It makes those funny videos I want to share with my family that much easier to view.  I would recommend this product for any and all people.","helpfulness":"0/0"},{"author":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"verified":true,"review":"I like the chromecast because it gives me smart tv capabilities with out buying the tv. The only thing I don't like is sometimes it disconnects while casting.","helpfulness":"0/0"},{"author":"Johnny apple seed","rating":3,"verified":true,"review":"Works ok, just not real easy to link each time for the non computer literate.

Also I can connect my computer which is not connected by WIFI, just wired to the router, which means that with the Chromecast you can connect any device that is in the network being WIFI or not. I recommended it, totally worth my money","helpfulness":"0/0"},
