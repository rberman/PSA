I actually own both the Fire TV Stick and the Fire TV and love them both. I did have the misfortune of getting a defective unit as I was shipped one of the first ones made, but they made it right and shipped me a fresh one which works great. Everything works great as it should. As with all streaming sticks, due to licensing there is always something missing. For me that's HBO GO connectivity. Everything else is great. I usually carry a chromecast and a Fire TV stick with me whenever I travel so I have choices. I like the fact that the Fire TV Stick has all the Prime content loaded up as default And for those of you who are Prime members taking advantage of that dollar credit they offer for slower shipping can come in handy when you find stuff you want to rent or buy on video that isn't included in the Prime offerings. For me the slower shipping credit can add up to a free movie pretty quickly as I will often look for deals on Amazon.I haven't messed around with the games part of the stick yet, but at some point I will get the game controller and do it properly and report back. I expect it will be pretty cool though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven M.
