I'm able to watch Amazon Prime and You Tube content on my HD TV. Using the remote to search for content is a little slower than normal internet search. I also had a small issue when plugging in the Stick to a power strip. TV could detect the Stick but I was not getting the menu / content to load. There problem was the Stick was not getting power despite being plugged in. Error message displayed on TV did not pinpoint the problem as lack of charge. I identified the issue by unplugging / reconnecting the device and discovered I had to wiggle the plug in the electric socket. Power light indicator on stick might be helpful.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John K.
