I watched everything on my phone and after a while it became annoying. I did not want to purchase the other ones similar to this because I don't play games and I did not want all the extra stuff. I bought this a month ago and it works beautifully. Instillation was a breeze. Everyone in the house loves using it. BUY IT!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nina"}]
