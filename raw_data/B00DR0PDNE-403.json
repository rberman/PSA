However no USB port was available on the TV but wound up using the included power supply and cable and plugged into AC power. Casting to the Chromecast has limitations but it works well for internet provided content if you do not have a \"Smart\" TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CNJ01 \"Joseph Calusio\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just what was expect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.
