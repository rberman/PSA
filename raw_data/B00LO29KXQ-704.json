My daughter was living with me so I tried her wireless provider and it worked otherwise I would have had to return it.  I also have the Amazon Fire box.  I had no problems running that off my internet provider.  The Fire TV Stick remote does not have all the commands as the Amazon Fire box remote.  The Amazon Fire box remote is much better.

I love amazon and enjoy their services, but I never seem to get reliable streaming and the fire stick seems to just freeze altogether at times. It has been frozen for the past 15 minutes prior to this review. My internet is directly next to it, and it is alway buffering. Possibly this is because I purchased a refurbished one? Well I wi just continue to stream from my xbox one instead.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "john"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "YOU NEED FAST INTERNET!!
