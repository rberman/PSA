With these I can use my TVs with no hassles and the way it integrates the service I subscribe to (Pandora, Prime, Netflix, etc) makes it even easier to use than my computer. While not near as powerful or feature rich as set top media centers or a full blown PC they are perfect for turning that old TV into a \"smart tv\" and are much cheaper.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "T.
