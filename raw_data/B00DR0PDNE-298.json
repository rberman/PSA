At first, I thought the glitch was the fault of Starz, but then it started to happen on Netflix and HBO Go as well. I couldn't get through an episode without it buffering every few minutes. Google apparently knows this isn't a good product, because they'd offer nothing but to replace it with the same thing. No refunds after 15 days and that's ONLY if you bought it on Google Play. Fortunately, Amazon is the greatest and they gave me a one time refund, though it had been two and a half months at this time. For $12 more, I ordered a Roku stick, which has more apps AND a remote AND it's own on screen interface.

I have strong WiFi and yet I can't watch a movie or show without it skipping I don't have a problem with my other devices just this. I also disconnected everything on my TV because I thought there might be a frequency problem, but no its just Google came out with a non functional piece of equipment.
