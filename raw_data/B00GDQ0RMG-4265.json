But this device is sold in a very misleading way. Any graphics and summaries portray this device as plugin and you're done. The truth is it requires a USB power cable to power it. So if you are planning to stick this into your smart TV's HDMI cable and call it a day, NOPE. If you have your TV on the wall, you'll either have a cable dangling or have to run it through the wall. It's a huge drawback that Amazon has gone out of their way to avoid mentioning.Once the USB cable is plugged in, it's very decent. Staggers on HD home videos with Plex, but TV shows and movies from Prime Instant in HD run fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "G.B."}]
