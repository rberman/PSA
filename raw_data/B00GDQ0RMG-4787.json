I don't have to have my tablet or phone around in order to launch apps or watch Netflix, etc. Half of the time, my devices are rarely charged and always running on low battery. I love the remote that comes with this device. It can be used for everything. For some odd reason, I never lose it either. It is comfortably small.You can download apps to the Fire TV stick. I was amazed at this. I tried a demo of \"You Don't Know Jack\" and \"Fibbage\" and ended up having to purchase the entire 2015 Party Pack for $24.99. Guests are amazed at how innovative these games are. You can connect to the Fire TV with your cell phones and devices and play games in conjunction with your TV. It's so hilarious and entertaining. Yes, I know you can do something similar like this with Chromecast, but the quality of the apps available for the Amazon Fire series are jaw dropping. You can download a fireplace app or an aquarium app to play on your TV, etc.For the price, it is so worth it. I recommend it over and over to all of my friends looking for something that is affordable and capable of playing Netflix, Hulu, etc. You get so much more than what it is priced for. Why buy something that costs more than this?!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "digitalelectric"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love the fire stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard L.

For the price, you can't find a better streaming stick. It has all the apps that you could want, with the exception of HBO Go which is coming soon! The remote feels a little cheesy but is very functional and easy to use. Good menus and ease of use make this an excellent purchase!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Spencer H Zoth"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really have enjoyed my fire stick so far.
