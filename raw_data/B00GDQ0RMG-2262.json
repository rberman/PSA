At home I use Netflix, Hulu, Xfinity On Demand and DVR where I can access a broad variety of shows on my schedule on a big screen.  In a hotel I can watch most of the same stuff easily on my relatively tiny laptop or tablet screen while the room\u2019s 40-inch TV offers programs that either cost money or started 10 minutes ago and don\u2019t have a pause button.  I can sometimes connect a cable from my laptop to the TV, but it needs to support either the VGA or HDMI cable that I have.  But mostly I can\u2019t tolerate having to get my butt of the bed or couch without a remote.  I tried a few MiraCast adapters, which are basically cable replacements, but the video streaming was jerky and laggy.  So the advent of streaming sticks seemed to be perfect for me until I found out that my Chromecast and Roku can\u2019t get past the hotel\u2019s Wi-Fi validation screen.  I don\u2019t know about AppleTV, but I\u2019m not part of that ecosystem.  Then a few months ago the Amazon Fire TV Stick got a firmware upgrade that added a browser that gave it the ability to fill in the hotel\u2019s web page to access their Wi-Fi and hallelujah, everything works the way I want it to and I can access everything I can at home except my DVR.  It also does MiraCast which lets me add a second screen to my laptop just like I do at home.Five Stars, I can\u2019t recommend this product highly enough.  And did I mention that I got it for $20 with their introductory offer.  That\u2019s half the other products\u2019 price.  I wish I had bought the limit of 5 in hindsight.  I assume the others will add this feature (heck Chromecast begins with Chrome) but I\u2019ll still stay with AmazonThere is still the problem of hotel Wi-Fi being slow, but that\u2019s not something any stick can solve.  And finally I want to dig at Comcast for not supporting HBOGo.  Not relevant to this product, but it\u2019s one of my many first world technology annoyances.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Kerry Ogata"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It's a really cool little thing, sometimes I have issues with it connecting to the WiFi but I'm not sure if it's my signal or the stick", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "abraham leyva acosta"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was easy to install, and works well.
