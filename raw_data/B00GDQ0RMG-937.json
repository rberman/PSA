So amazon offered a 14 day free trial on the fire stick, I signed up and immediately after spent over an hour on tech support because it wouldn't work. Eventually sling support told me to just cancel the service from amazon and sign up directly with them of course then I only got a 7 day trial. The menu of the Fire Stick is not that great it shows way to many \"advertisements\" basically for amazon video and amazon games and amazon everything. I would prefer to just see what I want to use on the menu system instead of all that junk. Other then that it does work pretty well. I mostly use it for Netflix and Emby.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Jake"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works great, so easy to set up and use.
