I just bought the Nexus Player when amazon revealed the Fire Stick for $20, well there was no reason to jump on it. They have done a fantastic job with it. The menu is very well put together. The remote app for android just works (Google you need to learn from them). For ppl who love customizing and tinkering with this device, it's very easy to side load apps into it. When I mean sideload I mean pushing apps like xbmc onto the device from your computer using adb over wifi. I am going to remove 1 star just because there is no way to access sideloaded apps from the home screen. You need to go all the way deep into their menu to access it.One thing I hope amazon would incorporate into their device is to add a universal search like Roku does.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D'Silva"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really great.
