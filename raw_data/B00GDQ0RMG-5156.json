[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "1st time I plugged it in it worked great. Then after a few days it froze up completely. Totally didn't respond to the remote. I finally unplugged it to see if it would reboot when I plugged it back in. It won't work and won't hook up to my wireless. I have many devices on wireless and it has a strong signal and all the rest work fine. The fire tv stick just won't connect. For me a waste of money and I will stick with Roku 3 which always works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Harley R.

Once it happens once it just continues until I removed the batteries & let it set for awhile. I can use the remote for a short amount of time before it start messing with my Vizio tv & trying to turn it off. I used the Android remote app & that works fine for hours, but once I try the supplied remote it's nothing but problems. Very disappointing because the main reason I got it was for the physical remote so family members wouldn't have to mess around with a smartphone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Bryce Thomas"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I thought it would blow my Chromecast out of the water but no it did not.
