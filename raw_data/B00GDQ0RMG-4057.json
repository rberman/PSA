Highly recommend to anyone who is searching for a streaming stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have a Fire TV and I love it so I was very excited when Amazon announced the Fire TV Stick.  I was doubly excited when Amazon offered it to existing Prime members at half price.  Unfortunately, ever since then I have been severely disappointed.  From the very get go the remote was, in a word, wonky.  It would lag and then after a second or two it immediately apply all of the presses.  This made it very, very difficult to enter User IDs and passwords.  Eventually, the device was updated and it was more usable.  Well, it would have been more usable except for its horrible WiFi antenna.  I have one Fire Stick in my loft next to a Wii and Xbox 360.  The other two devices along with every other electronic device I put there has no problem connecting to my WiFi, but with the Fire Stick I am constantly greeted with the message that \"Home is not available\".  Even worse, when I select to connect to a network I get a perpetual searching notice that never finds my SSID.  It not only fails to see my SSID, but also the twelve other networks that every other device sees.  Further illustrating the issue is the Fire Stick in my bedroom.  The router is 3 feet away and guess what?  That's right, I am constantly greeted with the Home not available message there also.  Oh and by the way, who's genius idea was it to make an update for your remote that is separate from the device update.  How would your typical user know to go to their remote settings to update their remote???  I guess the bottom line is this, I feel that my $40 was wasted on these two Fire Sticks.  Take your $40 and buy the regular FireTV.  You'll be much more satisfied.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jme1971"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Super cool device.
