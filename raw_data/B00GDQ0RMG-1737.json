The Fire TV Stick claimed it could do that for me (& a whole lot more) for only $40, so I figured what the hell, I'll give it a try.  To make a long story short within 2 weeks I called DIRECTV & told them to cancel my service because I was hardly using it anymore.  I have found PLENTY to watch on the Fire TV Stick, and MOST of it is FREE !  You do have to play around with it for awhile to get used to it, and some of the channels / apps work better than others, but there's so much to choose from it really doesn't matter.  Fire TV Stick made me a believer.  I have a sneaky suspicion that as more of us \"catch on\" & \"cut the cord\", this streaming stuff will become the way almost everyone will be watching TV in the future.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Metallic Media \"Tim\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is the best thing ever.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bakesgreat"}]
