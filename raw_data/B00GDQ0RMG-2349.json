Though internet was connected it kept on saying no internet connection and I got irritated of it and left it there.Display is a major issue. I have 40 inch HD samsung tv but the display either does not fit properly. If I set auto I am not seeing the picture full screen if I make it fit to screen I am seeing atleast 2 -3 inches from all 4 sides being cut. I tried scale but it didnot help.The home page is crazy and the UI flow is so confusing. I probably comparing to ther streaming players I am using but I dont like this flow.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Abinash"}]
