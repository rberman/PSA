Contreni"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Silly and Frustrating. The stick doesn't come close to Chromecast. I bought both at greatly reduced prices during sales. Basically I was told upon my frustrated inquiry that you cannot \"fling\" from the stick or mirror- unless you have a late model fire. In order to get information from Amazon (they have a record of my myriad caslls) it was like piulling teeth. Their overseas operators have no idea how to solve a problem where you do not have the latest Kindle Fire. You end up with a :sorry it's not possible\". In order to do anything I had to research the problem on the internet, grind my teeth and finally solvre it. What a difference with the Barnes and Noble Nook. No such problems. Also as I read the Chromecast which I am installing in my West Coast home, it should be much easier. In any event- It seems to me that Amazon's obsession with its propriery  system prevents it from either putting out a really useful product- or servicing it. over the phone Android will always be Abdroid and Amazon doesn't come close.
