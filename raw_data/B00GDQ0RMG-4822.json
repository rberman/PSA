Installation was easy - thanks to the flexible HDMI connector that came with it (there was not enough room behind the TV for the stick if I had to insert it directly into the HDMI slot).  Start-up was very smooth - the directions were clear.  I have only used it to watch some Amazon Prime video but it worked great for that.Well worth $19 to get the extra connectivity to the TV.  At the $40 price, I would seriously look at the Chromecast and Roku competitors.  Some of the other reviewers have made very good arguments for those units.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Don65"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "excellent.
