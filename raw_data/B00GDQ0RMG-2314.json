Are there no free movies to watch on Amazon's platform??? If so, I just don't know how or where they are.-  Just 1GB of storage!? Really?! For a device that allows you to download apps?? It's a joke! I didn't think much about it when I purchased it because I'm not that interested in games, but for those who do I guess 1GB is going to be insufficient at some point.Pros:- The only thing I appreciate is that I can watch videos on YouTube since my Apple TV has removed that service. Basically, that's the main reason I bought this device. I found two YouTube apps that work very well and one Vevo app.- Also, there are different channels and I feel there is more variety (I think).  I found an app with lots of foreign, specially Korean, films... Which is different and I like the option - even if the films are not the best.- I like its size, too. It's quite convenient and easy to transport and take anywhere you need to.- I'm not much of a gamer, but it gives the chance to download games and play over there. At least a couple of nice games.- I think $40 is not too expensive. Quite affordable. Based on what I've got and have free access to as a non Amazon Prime member, but Netflix customer, $40 is ok.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Laura"}]
