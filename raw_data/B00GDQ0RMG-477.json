We cancelled our cable as it was expensive and didn't work half the time. I am very happy with this TV stick. I mainly use it for Netflix. I have a 4 year old, and there are a lot of great kids shows on there. I have Amazon Prime, and to be honest the prime content on there is ok. Netflix pretty much has the same stuff. I do like the fact that I can order new released movies, which are basically the same price as if you order them through your cable provider. Just make sure on your Amazon account you have the credit card you want as your primary. When you order a movie or anything else for money, it charges that main card. I also like the fact that I assigned a pin for ordering content, so my 4 year old doesn't order everything. Some cd's bought through amazon have a digital copy included, which you can play through this thing also. Which is really nice. As well as watching music videos through vevo or YouTube. I actually just realized today that it has the HBO Now app on there. I did not think it was released on the TV stick, but there it was! Super excited about that. That is the one thing I miss about cable, was my HBO. Very smart for that app to be in there. I love Game Of Thrones, and was bummed that I might not see the new season next year. Very happy with this TV stick. One of the best purchases I made on Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alexandra M."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We have been using our DVD player to watch Netflix and other online content for years.

I own two Rokus and this does just as good a job, and it certainly takes up less space.
