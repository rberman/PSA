[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I've had it about week and used it all weekend to really put it through the paces. The set up is pretty easy and the interface is nice. I like how it works with the remote and it is very easy to get around the different Apps. The HuluPlus interface could be improved to get to personal queues- it just isn't organized the way I would have it personally. I will say that my WiFi is signal is only \"very good\" at best; often it gets bogged down beyond my control- (thanks to U-verse and my living arrangements in a backhouse). The U-verse equipment just isn't very good, especially the WiFi, even though we have an extender and have done all we can. So the Stick lost the signal often or couldn't load the stream, especially when the guests in my landlord's home are all on the WiFi. I suspect that this has more to do with connectivity setup than the Stick but if you have similar issues (multiple uses on the stream, equipment not up to the task, you want to use it in a large house or separate building and with multiple users) it may present the same limitation. In my hands, my Chromcast was able to pick up where The Stick could not. By and large, what I was viewing was still watchable on Chromcast when The Stick wouldn't connect, although still some streaming delay, but not terrible- so interesting. That said, I really do prefer the Fire TV Stick interface and getting Amazon Instant Video and PBS- it is the better interface and the content additions make it an excellent value especially if you are a cord cutter. I look forward to seeing what they do with the iOS interface when it becomes available.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.

Chromecast will support Windows only so far as the Chrome browser. I wanted something that would take the entire Windows desktop experience. Miracast promises to do just that.Unfortunately, as of this review there is no support for Miracast on Windows machines. It does support some Android phones/tablets (like my GS4) but you are out of luck if you want to fling your Windows desktop.The product description specifically calls out Miracast certification. At the very least Amazon should explicitly state that Windows casting does not work at this time. I suspect there will be a lot of disappointed users after they fire this device up for the first time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "12/13", "author": "W.

After spending a long time on the phone yesterday with tech support, there is still no resolution to the problem.  Hopefully they will eventually get back to us and fix the problem or send a functioning product.  If they do I will update my review.  But so far, we are very disappointed & researching the Google Chromecast vs. Roku as a replacement.Update:  I called again on Monday but was told there was no update on the trouble ticket yet.  I called again today (Wednesday) and was told there is still no update.  The person on the phone offered to have the unit replaced, but then said the replacement could not be processed because the trouble ticket is still open.  She transferred me to a supervisor who was not at all helpful and had a bad attitude.  He said someone will call me tomorrow (Thursday).  So after another 45 minutes on the phone today (Wednesday) there is no resolution and I am stuck with a non-funtioning product. I am very dissappointed in Amazon's customer service on this issue.  I have am generally an amazon fan - I have their credit card, 2 kindles, and the new echo, but I'm not thinking very highly of them any more!!!  If there is no resolution tomorrow I am returning the fire stick and will spend my $ on a roku - and won't buy it on amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "S.
