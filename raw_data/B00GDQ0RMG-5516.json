I only have them for the Amazon Prime Video.  The stick was on sale for $19 and for that price it was an easy decision.  I recently hooked up the fire stick and it works much like the original fire tv, without voice search.  But the remote lag is almost a show-stopper.  It almost has a mind of it's own.  While trying to register the device it was very difficult to even enter an email address.  Now that I am over that the stick works well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Bought just as an experiment because the price was right, but the World is EMF-toxic enough without extra radio transmitters in my own house (how many folks do you know with tumors on the cellphone side of their head), so I won't add a WiFi node.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "J.
