[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This product is amazing. It has been a week I started using this and so far no issues. It's wireless HD video streaming from you local computer or tablet with awesome HD video quality + online HD videos. It works great with my tablet as well as laptop. The only issue is it doesn't support 1080p but it can be solved by using Chrome extension. I am using Chromcast Beta and Videostream extension to play 1080p HD video and the quality is great.So pack you HDMI cables and start using Chromecast. it won't disappoint you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "nikunj"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love the Chromecast. At home, it works beautifully. Easy to set up and easy to use. The ever expanding number of apps that can run on it makes it a good buy for almost anyone.But if you buy it to use on college campuses, or traveling to hotels that use browser logins rather than passwords to connect to the internet, you won't be able to use Chromecast. It's sad, but currently Chromecast has no way to connect to these types of wireless hookups. So while I love the Chromecast, I can't use it part of the year, which is sad. The price and size are perfect for college students, but they can't use it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Leigh"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "When it works its great", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jackie Thomas"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I should've known my experience with the Google Chromecast wasn't going to bode well after the tumultuous problem I had with setting it up. I couldn't get chromecast to connect to my internet. It came with minimal directions and even after checking the chromecast website wasn't much helpful. I turned to the google chromecast forums and alas, I found the help I needed. I had to take an insane amount of troubleshooting (i.e. looking up my router provider, calling the toll free number, finding out how to change my router settings AND MORE) to get the device connected. If I wasn't a quasi patient wanna be techie, I would've quit after the first hour of trying to set this up. After at least 2.5 hours,  the assistance from the forum was a god send. Then once connected, I learned via the forum why my signal probably wasn't as strong and suggested ideas to strengthen my connection. Something about having to go around walls. But after a few days I realized my signal wasn't going to be strong enough to stream without buffering. I also wished there were more apps that Chromecast worked with. Even when I used the google chrome extension on my laptop the chromecast still didn't work well. That's when I knew it had to be returned.  I returned the device and will continue using my blu ray.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.
