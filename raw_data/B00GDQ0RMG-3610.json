I thought that the fee was exorbitant since I had already paid for the Plex app, but I begrudgingly paid the $5 fee.  This allowed me to watch my own video, but shortly thereafter, the Plex app asked me to pay the fee again.  Until this glitch gets resolved, the Fire TV stick has not met my expectations.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I really like the Fire Stick.
