To be honest, I let it sit around for four months because I just didn't want to deal with the installation procedures. That was a waste of four months. The install is dead simple and took just about 15 minutes. Tech guys could have done it in 5 minutes I'm sure. So now I watch everything that comes in on my iPads, iPhones, Google tablets, Samsung Note III and other various video and photo sources. I use this unit on a Sony Bravia 54 inch TV. The syncing of signals is seamless. The HD videos are spectacular. If you have international TV subscription services you will never want to leave the TV room. For the price on offer this unit is a steal. I \"cut the cord\" years ago and have saved thousands of dollars. The Google Chromecast just makes getting rid of the cable companies that much easier.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kevin \"Old HP Guy\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I think they should mention that you must sign up for a Monthly ($35) fee to use this device", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "R.
