I've been using the Apple TV for awhile and bought the Fire stick to test it out in hopes of it being a hit so I could buy a few more as Christmas gifts.  The price is great and the remote is slightly bigger than the Apple TV's remote so it's easier to use but the interface is harder to navigate through.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jean"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product better than the chromecast love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JOSE CABA"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Super easy set up!

Got at the intro price so no real complaints about the quality and results. Seems like a good option to take along when traveling.

I didn't have to break out scissors and knives to get it out.  Set up was a breeze.  Having the dongle extension included made hooking it up to the tv easier.  Amazons side scrolling interface works fine. It loads and plays pretty fast for the size of it. I purchased this because the price was good and I needed something for traveling purposes.  The only disappointment I had with this was I cannot play minecraft on it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wonderful!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carla Stoufer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "One comment: Fire TV Stick DOES work with a Receiver's HDMI port, I called Amazon about this issue they said it would have to be a direct connection.

I also find the interface a tad clunky, when compared to other Android TV HDMI sticks. Maybe with future updates they could include a app drawer. I ordered this for the 19 dollar promotion so I have no complaints. At full price, I would rather spend the extra money to buy the Roku stick.Update...01/23/2015 After owning this device for two months, I stand by my previous review. Streaming apps work great, Amazon instant streaming, Netflix, Espn, YouTube ect. Please overhaul terrible User Interface, I should not have to click on a app twice to open it. (first click to open title card, second click to launch app)The YouTube app could have a better layout as well. Streaming is very fast on this device. I would like another Stick for upstairs TV, no way would I spend $40 for it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tacitblue"}]
