Took 3 weeks to deliver,  wasnt able to hook up to my first Wi-Fi and so I changed companies because I wasnt satisfied with them to begin with.  Then I got my next Wi-Fi subscriber and Iit says I dont have enough band with.  A joke really because the DVR that I have that carries the very same Netflix that I was trying to watch on Amazon works fine!!!  I want my money back and an apology for this crappy device!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matthew Rodriguez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this! I received it already  preinstalled with my info from my Amazon account and movies etc. that i have bought from them over the years. It was programed to just me:) was so easy to install and use. Takes the place of my kids game systems to watch HULU and Netflix plus loads of other apps that the game systems can't do. This is the best money I have spent in a long time! I have been telling anyone that will listen about this and that they need to get one. With every cent and then some! It is a must have for anyone that uses any online streaming for their movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kathy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is WONDERFUL.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "linda j. lee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great with Amazon Prime -- so nice not to have to hook up the computer to watch prime movies or shows. It didn't work well with Netflix (constant buffering), but my blu ray player doesn't work well with Netflix either so I think it's an issue with our TV or cable and Netflix rather than a problem with the fire stick.

Easy to use right out of the box.  Battery cover isn't the easiest to get off the remote... but that is minor.  The only reason I don't give this 5-stars is because I can't right off figure out how to get the other apps to work (meaning not Amazon Instant) and it isn't covered in the tutorial that runs on setup.
