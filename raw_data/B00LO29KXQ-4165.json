Doesn't really play nice with my Android phone as far as directly casting goes.  If I try to cast through my Netflix app (like the Chromecast does) it nearly always fails.  Works fine with the Fire Stick Remote app, although it isn't as convenient as directly casting from the desired app.My main problem with this piece of hardware, and the reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 5 is because it worked on my living room TV (where I want it) for about 4 days.  After that I got an error message about protected content.  Can't fault them for trying to protect their content providers interests but it is at the cost of the quality of their product...  It didn't work on my living room TV for 3 weeks straight and Amazon support couldn't help.  Plugged into my bedroom TV it works fine.  It has something to do with it being a newer TV but as it worked the first 4 days and THEN stopped I feel like their efforts have gone too far.In summation, don't buy this unless you're sure your TV will play nice with it...which is kind of hard to know without having one to test.  So, for the price, go buy a Chromecast.  Sorry Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Brandon Rawls"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My kids love it. Way better than Netflix.

I have a 10 year old flat screen that is not smart, but still works just fine. The Firestick allows me to access YouTube, Netflix and Now Amazon Prime shows. I had tried to use the Chrome stick in the recent past and was unable to get it to set up properly, while the Firestick worked like a charm with my computer and TV. Set up was super easy.The only issue I had was in regard to getting one month of Amazon Prime free. My account was charged the full amount up front. Maybe this is how they do it, but that seems a little shady. I decided to go ahead and keep my subscription for the year as I do enjoy many of the new shows they have out now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SophomoricOne"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I just received my new amazon fire tv stick and everything works well. Except the remote. I have had to use the app for my phone because having the stick in hdmi port the remote won't work for me unless I point at it behind my tv.  I would appreciate if amazon would send me a remote replacement so I don't have to use my phone app I downloaded.  Will make rating better once get a replacement remote", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jennifer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works great ! Glad I bought it.
