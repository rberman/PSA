[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works as advertised. Easy to install.Five stars for this.However, the remote is not user friendly. It slips through my fingers - it's hard to grasp. When it's face down it's hard to pick up. And the jog-dial does not always do what I want it to do.Thus the 4 stars.Message to Amazon:Put three finger sized indentations along the left edge to make the unit graspable - and distinctiveMake it easy to pick up when face down - the bevel on the back might look cool but it's not user friendly, I have to slide it off the edge the table to pick it up. Maybe make the radius on the front larger and thus easier to graspMake the jog-dial work better - it jumps more than one selection at a time and it's hard to feel or find unless I am looking at itI have normal sized hands and work with my hands so I have a sense when a devise is hand friendly or not - this device is definitely not hand friendly. Maybe it needs to be just a tad larger...with a grip on the back...It's an inexpensive device but it can be a stunning looking and working device at the same time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Roy Prince"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy install and simple to control.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jennifer Huen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very useful.
