I have had so many problems with it losing connection and having to disconnect my internet only to \"reset\" the stick.  At first I thought maybe it was my speed or possibly a weak single strength in my house but each speed test is showing i'm getting what i'm supposed to.

In searching for answers online, found a forum devoted to the same issues i was having.
