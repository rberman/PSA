It happens almost all of the time.  No, its not my internet connection...i run speed check and i am always between 16 and 25 Mbps, usually over 20.  It has to be on the content delivery side.  Problem is worse during prime time viewing.  Great idea, if they could deliver the content.

We have a Sony media player and Sony Blu-Ray w/streaming, both of those helped us to cut the cord on satellite t.v., but the Fire Stick is just so much better. I'm considering buying another so I can have one hooked to all our tvs. It's faster than the media players with much more content and apps. Watching t.v. has taken on a whole new meaning for our household.
