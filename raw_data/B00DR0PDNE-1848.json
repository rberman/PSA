I have had a few times where I had to unplug it several times and rerun the set-up app to get it to connect to my internet connection. Nothing was wrong with my home network, because all of my other devices worked. I reset that anyway, just in case. Eventually, it reconnected. Other than that, it connects with my apps and shows nicely.\u200b", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angelica Thomas"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works Great!!!

It works great. Yes I have a built-in YouTube app on my Sony tv, but my desire to search for things using an on-screen alphabet controlled by the directional control on my tv remote, to then have most of the videos not even load properly is about the same as my desire to repeatedly head butt my Sony gorilla glass until one of us gives way. Incidentally this is what I would be doing if I couldn't Chromecast my YouTube videos. From what I've read, the gorilla glass would probably win.The best part is once the video is streaming it doesn't use my iPad battery power. When Chromecast isn't doing anything it also shows you amazing pictures which are both calming and enticing. It's $35, I'm not sure where the decision even is.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul P \"The US Brit\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love watching netflix, hbo go, and you tube on this.
