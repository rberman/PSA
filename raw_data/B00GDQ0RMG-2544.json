My NAS video content is all in 720p and my Netflix account is set to stream in HD. This was a problem for the Fire TV Stick. On both Netflix and Kodi, it would have to pause every few minutes to buffer. This was not a Netflix issue or a internet/LAN bandwidth issue. My PS3 streams Netflix in HD just fine.A few days ago, I received my Fire TV. Sideloaded Kodi and got it all up and running. The faster processor and larger memory allows this to stream both Netflix and Kodi in HD with no buffering issues. They are both great products, but if you want to stream HD, go with the Fire TV. If you want portability and HD is not a priority, the stick will be just fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "L.
