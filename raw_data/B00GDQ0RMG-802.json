I received Fire TV for Christmas, works beautifully. I bought a stick for a second tv and the remote wouldn't connect. Amazon sent me a whole new Fire Stick and this one, while the remote registers, it will not hold the WiFi connection even after logging into my router and changing the channel and the remote itself I ALMOST THREW IT ACROSS THE ROOM. Every time I tried to select ANYTHING, it skipped to a complete different option. What should have taken me 20 seconds to do, took me 5 plus minutes. Ridiculous. I might just get another Fire TV and avoid the stick all together.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "alissa c"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing I love my fire stick as much as getting a smart tv!
