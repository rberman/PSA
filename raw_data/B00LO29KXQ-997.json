It was east to set up and even my 4 year old knows how to use it without my help! *** Im coming back to add this on my review, because I got a non-helpful review...When I received I knew what I was getting, because I did a lot of research on these. I really didn't have to refer to the instructions its pretty self-explanatory and once plugged in it will walk you though the setup process. I haven't had any issues with losing wifi connections yet, but can be slow when playing a movie, but i think that is just my internet connection itself. Bottom line its worth the money! Im glad I snagged this on the Prime Day specials!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Natalie"}]
