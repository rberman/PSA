[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am so sick and tired of Direct TV and their endless phony reality shows.  And the gouging costs!!!!  So we decided to give this a try.  After all I love reading but couldn't believe that Kindle could be a good reading experience and I absolutely love the Kindles...we have four now, and more books than I ever thought possible to get in our little house.  And I love the Kindle reading experience, probably spend 4-6 hours a day reading....So now we look forward to learning how to use the Fire Stick....and being able to watch what and when we wish.  good riddance to Direct TV and many many thanks to Amazon for all the cool stuff they keep creating.  I think they are making my old age much better than it would have been!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Austintatious"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I was really excited about the Fire Stick but unfortunately it's been a disappointment as it will not connect to our xfinity x1 wifi. All of our devices  connected to our wifi effortlessly but for whatever reason the same cannot be said for the Fire Stick. We only get error messages when trying to connect. If the issue was fixed I would gladly give a better rating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "eppfam06"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "FAST DELIVERY!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Felicia Blessing"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my fire stick.

I own 2 apple TVs and swear by them.  The firestick I bought to have while traveling and it has far exceeded my expectations.  It's fast, has lots of apps, even some that can do AirPlay streaming/mirroring (ymmv).  Access to amazon content, games, etc. make this item a no brainer.

The app section is better, but not having a remote is not convenient (for our family at least) and we have found that when we travel, the wifi better be VERY strong for any hope of the chromecast working.  Another downside to the Chromecast is their lack of partnership with Amazon.The GUI on the fire is great.  There are a few things I would change- like having a favorite app section on the home screen to easily navigate to other \"channels\" right now we mostly use \"most recent\" and I wish the \"back\" button and \"home screen\" button on the remote were in a different spot.  Overall- little things compared to being able to have channels like HBO, Showtime, Starz and Encore- along with the big three streamers; Amazon, Netflix and Hulu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "fatbald1 \"jjwise1\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For the price these things are awesome.
