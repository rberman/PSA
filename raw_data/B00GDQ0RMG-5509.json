Nice physical design.  Small.Cons:  terribly cluttered difficult to navigate interface that is very locked down.  If you're used to android or ios, you'll find it very difficult to find the content you want in a short time.  The search function should be more intuitive, easier to access.  The amazon apps available are limited and not very useful.  NO ability to stream or use google content except for youtube.  The remote uses swipe functions only, and is a non standard android controller.  If you try to sideload a better launcher, well you won't be able to navigate it.  If you sideload apps, they don't show up unless you navigate through the settings and on to app manager and launch them that way.  It feels like you're being locked down like an Apple device with less to offer and less refinement.  Chromecast is much more useful, especially now that you can stream your own photos and videos from Google cloud, and there is so much more support and integration now.  I wish I would have just bought an android stick or the nexus player.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pen Name"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This tiny streaming stick is amazing, the WiFi reception and peformance are very good for a device of its kind.Happy about the price I get it, only for 19.99, a great deal from amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisandro Duran \"Sephiroth02\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice product.

The Fire Stick immediately recognized my wifi extender and connected without issue. The remote works very well and the whole interface is very intuitive once you have used it a few times.The one huge gripe I have (worth 1 star off at least) is that the Fire Stick has to be plugged into the wall in order to work! Now that I look back at the description, I can find the small print that says it needs wall power, but I do think Amazon should make that clearer in its pictures of the Fire Stick being used and in its commercials on TV. I have my TV mounted on my wall with no wires showing and now I have one wire hanging down whenever I hook up the Fire Stick. I suppose I could take my TV off the wall and try to see if I could plug the stick in behind there, but that will be a lot of work and I don't think it's worth it at this point. I just would like to have known this fact before buying this product.My conclusion is that this device functions exactly as it claims and I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind a power cable coming from their HDMI input.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeff D.

For now, I need to let my thumb heal before trying to get the battery cover off again.

Howard"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "We have an Apple TV that we use on a daily basis and love it. We wanted this device to stream Amazon prime video since Apple TV doesn't have an app for that and Amazon doesn't allow mirroring from our iPad or iPhones for prime videos. I'm on the fence. When the dang thing keeps a connection to our wifi, it's great and functions just as we hoped. However, about 50% of the time, it will lose connection to our network, make us retype the network password 5x, and then \"connected with problems\", disconnects, and the process takes about 10 minutes before we are set to use. This is a hassle altogether. We only paid $19 for it so we will keep it for the prime video usage, but won't utilize it for any other apps, as our Apple TV is much more dependable and versatile for us.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!
