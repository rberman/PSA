Our summer camp now has DSL/wifi, but no cable available (we get NBC & PBS only on our antenna).  Bought this thinking we'd give it a shot, but lots of viewing options available on it thanks to our Amazon Prime.  It's a snap to move from tv in living room to tv in bedroom.  It works for us and we're happy to have it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "GottaLuvCruising"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Plugs in, menu comes up, and away you go.

For what you get, this seriously is not worth $40.  Looking back, I'd only pay about $20 for it.Really though, to even use it you have to lock into the $100 a year Prime membership.  I don't know, maybe if they could better describe why it cost so much, but right now it's kind of like paying the cable company for the tuner box.  I have to have it to access the service, so why isn't it included???But yes, Fire TV is AWESOME!  Lot's of fun, lot's of (okay) apps, plenty of content.  I like it alot!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "weAmazon"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great for my Amazon content and has one distinct advantage over Chromecast (though overall I like the Chromecast more): The remote.This allows me to connect the Fire Stick to my hotspot and play/navigate content from the stick to my car's entertainment system without the need for a second 'controller' device connected. I might end up buying a second Chromecast still for the car because with the Watch(TM) apps supported on Chromecast, I can cast live TV or even on demand content to my in car screens through the Chromecast. And at this price point, both devices are well worth it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "P.
