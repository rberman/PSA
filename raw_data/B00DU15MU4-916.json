[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Unboxed the unit. Waited through the tutorial that can't be skipped. Put in my Netflix account info. Unplugged it to reset, and move to another room.  Now it's dead. No power nada. Support sent me a refurbished when I bought a new unit. Price dropped 16$ the day after purchase, won't credit. I have an Apple TV that's 4 years old that still works great. 15 mins for the fire TV. Let's hope the refurb is better. Not holding my breath. If you need To sideload Xbmc I could see purchasing this heap. For straight Netflix streaming get a Roku or Apple TV.edit 04-13-15 The refurbished i received is a good working unit. I guess I got a lemon. Still new out of box and dead is unacceptable. Added 2 stars cause the new one works well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/4", "author": "Chris Campbell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is just amazing and the voice search works with Netflix and YouTube.

Installation of Android apps is a great feature but can be limited based on how the app is designed as you don't have a touch screen so everything has to be done by remote or controller for Android Apps. Fire TV Apps work great and very easy. The processing power and speed is above comparison to others. The only draw back I am seeing right now that there is no specific technical support website for it so trying to figure out some additional or special features was by trial and error such as setting up the router and Fire TV to get the best internet connection speeds for the best HD quality Viewing. I had to figure it out myself or Google it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "SCE Eagle1"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works really well, but as stated the interface is not nearly as user friendly as Roku.  Also, wish Vudu movies was available.  I share movies with my brother through Vudu and am not able to view any on this device.  The voice recognition is AMAZING as it can tell what I am speaking even with a cold.  I would recommendthis product, but until Vudu is available on the device I will not get another one for our other television.  We have a roku stick and we will be repeating that purchae.  ONLY because of the lack of Vudo.  I can live with the interface hoping Amazon will rectify this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SuperK"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It is worthless!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/9", "author": "Dana Solberg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is just plain FABULOUS!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Sharon desoua"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Family is very happy with the Amazon Fire with the amazon prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Albert Robbins"}]
