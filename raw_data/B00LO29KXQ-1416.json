I have been a Prime member for a couple of years, but the Stick keeps on asking me to sign up for Prime to access the Prime features (shows, movies, music, etc.). I contacted support and was advised to uninstall the Stick and reinstall it, and that should solve the problem. I did just that and the problem was solved, until the next time I went to use the Stick and try and watch a show from Amazon. The old problem reoccurred and now it asking me to signup for Prime again. After this writing I will contact support again,,, and see what happens. I like the product and hope the issue can be resolved.Update: I contacted Amazon support and was able to resolve the problem. So far is all good. The problem was that I have two Prime logons and I didn't registered my Fire Stick under the main account.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "RBC-RP"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's just like the Amazon Fire,", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anthony A Greene"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great tv stick", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "clinton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "With my Amazon Prime account this is an amazing entertainment device.
