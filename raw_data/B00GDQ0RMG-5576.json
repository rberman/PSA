[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got this when it went on sale for $19 bucks.  IT'S SO COOL.  We have an apple TV, and this firestick has a lot more capability, for a better price too.  The remote even works better than the apple tv remote.  I love that iphone users can still link up their music to hear on the TV, or even download an app to use the iphone as a remote.  Very high quality!  I mostly use it for Netflix, Hulu, Prime TV, Pandora...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Nikki"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Limited for now but good!

I have to reload my internet with it everytime I turn it back on because it tells me that it is connected with a problem, but there is no where that tells me what that problem is.  (and for those that think it is just my internet, internet runs same wireless apps off my wifi on my apple tv, xbox and blu ray players with no troubles.  When I have gotten it to work it streams fine but overall I am disappointed with this product because my experience with Amazon is that they put forth good products, I just think the bugs are not worked out of this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "nickdiesel"}]
