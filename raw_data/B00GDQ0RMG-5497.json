One more device to be plugged in, in a tangle of stiff cords behind the tv. The cord comes awkwardly out of the side of the stick, so it could not be plugged directly into my television along side my directv hdmi input without rearranging the plugs. The power supply cord that it comes with is a black square with the amazon logo that does not fit on a standard power strip. All this disappointment and I haven't even turned it on yet ...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Scott Bazzett"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Generally I like it and didn't want to give it just 3 stars because we did get it when it was offered for just twenty dollars definitely making it a great value. BUT, there are several cons we've found in the two weeks since it arrived. We have had serious connectivity issues and finally had to use the included HDMI extender because the WiFi connectivity was junk when it was connected straight into the TV (I guess the TV blocked the signal some - it is a wall mounted TV and we used the side input), now the connectivity is fine but the stick hangs out and is sloppy looking, which we could have just kept the computer connected if we wanted things hanging out the side of the television. If it had cost us full price I probably would have sent it back for this reason alone. We also dislike that there isn't an HBO app so we still have to hook up the computer (although we did know that when we purchased it).As far as pros, it is nice that it frees the up the computer, has HuluPlus and Netflix and the Netflix app is a more recent version than the one on our old bluray player that doesn't allow for more than one user. We don't use any of the games so I can't attest to that, and the remote TV app for my phone makes navigation nearly as easy as on a computer. The remote app on the phone will not wake up the stick however so the remote can't be put away which is another nuisance.For $20, it was a great deal, but it doesn't have great connectivity (despite being dual-band), it does keep us from having to replace a still functioning bluray player with one that has updated apps, and I am interested in seeing how it works when hooked into the stereo receiver instead of the TV if we ever get that set back up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AlySun_22"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is awesome! totally makes the prime membership worth it. Just the free television alone is amazing. gret selection including most HBO stuff.Set up was super easy, and it all runs very quick.super simple interface so you can find anything you want very quick. Rent single shows or entire seasons worth of stuff all at a reasonable price.I wish there was an app for the iphone to be able to use it as a remote and to share my screen but hopefully one day.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "l m"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Time to cancel DirecTv.

Netflix displays much better (and with more controls) on Fire TV Stick than on Apple TV.

However, little if any reason to choose it over competing products but for watching Prime Instant Video on the TV, which is why I bought it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "A.
