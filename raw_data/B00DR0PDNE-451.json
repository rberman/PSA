You still have to look at your laptop screen. ( were it not for this would give an extra starTHIRD BEST FEATURE: HDMI connection is nice but it has a problem. The problem has an easy solution that will cost you only $7.99. (PROBLEM) The chrome-cast device gets hot and stays hot.The heat affects components inside the TV. (SOLUTION) buy a 6 inch male male HDMI cable to extend the device connection so that the heat from the chrome device does not conduct to the TV. Cost $7.99. Problem solved and you're good to go.YES I WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING CHROME-CAST AND  I WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING OUT FOR THE REDESIGN I EXPECT THEY WILL IMPROVE ON THE HEAT PROBLEM AND THE SOFTWARE FOR WEBPAGE CASTING HOPEFULLY THAT BIT WILL BE A FREE UPGRADE.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"followup\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Chromecast is super reliable.
