I have relied on streaming through my PS3 but unfortunately my crappy  internet service provider does not support HBOGO.  I saw that the Fire Stick was reasonably priced therefore I ordered it.  Placed order on a Sunday and it was here by Wednesday (a whole 3days before Amazon said it would be here).  I couldn't wait to get home from work and watch my favorite shows using the Fire TV Stick.  Set up was easy and I was able to watch HBOGO with ease (thank you Mom).  I even downloaded the Amazon fire TV app to my phone so I am able to control my TV with it.  No need to purchase the 39buck remote with voice command.  The app has voice command and the ability to search through a keyboard.  The only regret I have is not ordering this sooner.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Moe_Moe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "First and foremost, I've tried several of these contraptions. This has been my favorite so far. It's crashed a couple times but only cause we've used it to much and it over heated! It's quicker, it's smarter, it's menu is cleaner.
