[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "It is an amazon product, and it shows.1- Apps are second class citizens. The main menu contains amazon specific items; apps can be reached under a menu item unlike roku where apps are prominently displayed on the screen. Recent menu will show the recently used apps and watched amazon content which is a redeeming factor if you want a shortcut to your netflix, hulu, etc. apps.2- The main reason I gave three stars is that the fire stick blacked out a few times. This happened during watching amazon content; it'd black out right after movie/show started, but came back very quickly. There were couple of other problems (distorted screen, unresponsive remote) with a third party app but that could be that app's fault.3- The remote is nice but feels a little flimsy.4- Fast forward and rewind does not feel very responsive during watching amazon content, but works OK in other apps.5- It feels *very* warm even long after the active use. I'm not sure if it goes to sleep mode by itself or not.6- I like the voice search option that can be used by installing an app to my tablet. But search results seem to be skewed mostly towards amazon content. It'd be great to show all available viewing options (amazon, netflix, hulu, etc.) for a given title in a clear interface; right now one has to go through all search results to see if there are other viewing options for a specific title.I already have a roku and I bought this fire stick for a very specific app that roku didn't have, and so far it serves the purpose. That's why I'm not worried about \"little stuff\", but if fire stick would be my only streaming option I'd probably have a different opinion. It could definitely use one firmware update or two but in general it's a good product for the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "d0_0b \"d0_0b\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Though my wifi signal is strong, about every other day if I use HBOgo it pauses every 15 seconds or so. I suppose it is buffering. Turns out lots of folks have my problem yet there's nothing about the problem with the app in Amazon support. Also installed the HDMI extension as another site suggested and nada. When the new Apple TV device comes out this fire stick will be kindling.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

We bought it to replace our several year old Apple TV box.  The second bit of good news is that I did not toss my vintage Apple TV box, that we use to watch Netflix and other entertainment including standard Apple TV entertainment offerings.Unfortunately the Amazon Fire Stick signals can't keep up with real time and we are constantly watching frozen screen events. Our Internet service is provided by Comcast and we have no service issues with Cable TV entertainment or with Apple TV.  In my area Amazon Fire Stick can't keep up with real time for regular Netflix entertainment offerings.  I am going back to watching Amazon Prime entertainment from my iPad through Apple TV via AirPlay onto my TV screen (or on my iPad).  Maybe the day will come when Fire Stick will command the same bandwidth from Comcast Internet services as Apple TV does so we can use it to replace Apple TV and gain single remote access to Amazon Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NickJ"}]
