Use is pretty straightforward. You turn on your tv, Fire comes up as source and it loads a menu.  You use a very small remote control to access the menu. Not a lot of buttons to figure out.  There is a nice, quick tutorial upon installation. A major issue, however, is that every couple of days, I've got to unplug the unit and let it reboot.  That gets a bit annoying.  I recognize the reboot symptoms when the remote quits working.  Annoying, but I'm using it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J. Moore"}]
