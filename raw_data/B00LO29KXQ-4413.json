[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am thoroughly happy with my Amazon Fire TV Stick! I am a Prime member, so it has a lot to offer! Although I can't compare it to other devices, it's easy to manage. A suggestion would be to illustrate how to open the remote in order to place batteries. I had to pry it open using a knife. Also, if you are not familiar with Input features on your TV, that too may be an issue. It's also inconvenient to keep changing from the actual TV input to the Fire stick input viewing.Overall, I am enjoying viewing Amazon Movies and TV shows on the Fire Stick rather than on my iPad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chrissie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's great .

Kept saying signal not strong enough though wireless bridge right next to it and 4 bars out of 5 in strength. I did watch a whole movie from Prime list with no problem except it did not fill my whole plasma screen. Haven't tried since because when I switched back to Dish my whole screen was pink background. Had to turn everything off and do full reset on Dish system. I am using an HDMI switch since my Plasma only has one.Only other item of note is you don't know how to work somethings and troubleshoot unless its working since system relies on video tutorials. Little pamphlet doesn't help much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Debbie W."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product easy to setup and use..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jason Joseph"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works great.

Now can't get Netflix to work after trying everything Netflix support says to do.  The Amazon prime video still works great, which is 50% of the reason I got it. However, Netflix was the other 50%, which DOES NOT WORK!!!And I did check Netflix on phone and PS3 - both worked.
