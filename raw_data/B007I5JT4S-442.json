[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I just got a new MacBook Pro, and was excited to give Apple TV a try.The good - images (still images and slideshows) are wonderful, and it has that Apple one-click and it works kind of setup. YouTube plays well as long as you use Safari, but for some reason sound won't play using Chrome browser.The bad - I first tried it while staying at a friend's house, and found the video choppy -- downloaded videos play smooth as silk on the laptop, but suffers from stutter on the TV. I thought it must be their network or something, and went ahead and ordered one for myself. But I have the same problem here at home, and I have a state of the art setup with high speed everything.And the real reason for such a low rating - Apple support has been a mixed bag -- the first woman I spoke with was snarky and rude and suggested I reset everything in my house and I found her completely unhelpful; the next person I spoke with was more helpful, and suggested I download the latest updates, which I did. They may have improved things slightly, but there is still this hesitation that gets in the way of a wonderful experience.  At least he gave me a case number, so I can call back and see if they have more suggestions. But I think this is a bug on their end, and one they should acknowledge.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Apple TV is a useful gadget. I bought it for my girlfriends bedroom when she first got a tv. She does not have a cable box, DVD player, or game console in her room. This device made it possible for her to do quite a bit, and she is extremely pleased with it. She mostly used it do netflix, but there are many other useful apps. She often uses the remote ability to play her iTunes from her computer through it as well. The only issues she ever has from it are a result of her outdated and slow internet connection.The device itself is visually appealing. It is very small and has the signature minimalist Apple design. The remote included is also very impressive. It is simple with limited buttons, but does everything needed. It is made out of metal and feels like a quality product. For the sake of comparison, holding the remote feels a lot like holding one of the older generation iPod Nanos. I believe the one in mind is the third generation that was tall and skinny, and came in various metallic colors. The remote has a nice weight to it and the buttons seem durable.After a year of owning the Apple TV, my girlfriend still loves it. I would state however that other options may be just as good at a lower price. The Roku players are a very similar product that are cheaper than apples version, and I'm sure she would be just as happy with one of those.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Alex"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Initially I thought to buy Roku but due to the easy interface of what apple had I preferred this ...I'm just loving itYou will enjoy if you have MacBook/Ipad", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really love the Apple TV for streaming TV and Movies through my ipad and iphone.
