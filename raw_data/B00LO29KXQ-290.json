I have a newer Apple TV that did not have the Amazon Instant Video app on it.  I really loved my Apple TV, but I have to say I love the size of the Firestick and its remote.  The best part is the price.  Also, recently my dad was in the hospital long term and with the convenience and size of the Stick, we were able to plug it in and watch some great tv.
