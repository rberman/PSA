Occasional loss of connection but I assume thats related to my Internet connection and not the device.  Some apps don't cast properly (ABC) but must of what is wanted can be found on Hulu.  This is a great alternative to expensive cable or satellite.  I look forward to more apps and improvements to overall quality of current apps", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kyle M Golden"}]
