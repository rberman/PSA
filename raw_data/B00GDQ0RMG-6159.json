I have this and Chromecast and already prefer this. I think it is very helpful to have some user interface on these things. Also I can mirror my HTC M8 with no problem.

The second no comes with the fact that the included USB cable is only useful if the television port is right on an outlet. In my case, with my television being on a mount, this required rearranging my entire setup just to use an occasional accoutrement to my AV system. I also use the ChromeCast use device which has no issue powering from the powered USB hub on the television I see no reason that this device should require wall power. Also having to physically put the unit to sleep is an extra step that should not be requires. Since it must be connected to the wall power a simple off command on the included remote should have been a no-brainer just as with any other independently powered A/V device.As far as I can tell it provides the services promised but the exclusion of a longer cable and no way to stop it from sucking power without going through several menus makes this \"meh\" in my opinion.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Boos mom \"angelandboo2\""}]
