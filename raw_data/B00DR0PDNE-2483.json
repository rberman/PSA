Am excited that they've opened up their SDK so that more third party apps can develop for Chrome.  I think that will open up a whole new world of apps.  The price is right and the installation is quick and easy.  Definitely worth buying one to try it out for yourself.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BP"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "If I could have paired it with my system it would have been great...could not use it.
