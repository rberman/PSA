I live near the water.  I already got the fact that the Chromecast \"stutters\" with the microwave on, but it also \"stutters\" because of local use of marine band radios.  Everything that can be cast to the Chromecast via the Google Browser's \"cast\" downloadable option, can be cast to a Roku.  Long as it's on the same Wi-fi, it works.  Roku, because of the frequency, never responds badly to the microwave or this marine radio traffic.  I bought the Chromecast, never having used Google Chrome (happy with Firefox).  I was frustrated about casting BookTV and other video sources that don't have Roku channels.  But, just the browser was all I needed, which is free,  it can cast to streaming devices, and you don't need a Chromecast to do it.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Starboard Home"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works ok, but beta version of Chrome PC to chromecast is still definitely beta.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kelly Gene Kimmitt"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "doesnt work that well", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "jim"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very good!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Masachika Terashima Junior"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works awesome,  but really Amazon?
