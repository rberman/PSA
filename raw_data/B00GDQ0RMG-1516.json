Do not buy it. It is absolutely terrible. The wifi will be at full strength and it will lose the connection, it will buffer maybe 20 times during a 30 minute TV show.

There is far too much clutter on the screen, too many other programs seem to overtake my \"recently viewed\" or my list.  I am hoping I get used to all the clutter and can learn to disregard. I don't find the arrangement of information to be organized, for example, I have NetFlix, Amazon Prime, and the other streaming services such as Hulu etc.  They are all over the place so it is a hunt 'n peck to find something.I am THRILLED though with this feature -- when you are done watching a show, if a series, it goes right on to the next episode without the need of using the remote to select again (as with Roku).  This little feature along is worth all the other things I don't care for.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "deborah"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Serves my needs, works well but wish it provided more information on the fire sticks operation and which programs are eligible for viewing with Amazon Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susanne Nobile"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I got a Fire Tv Stick for free for buying Dish's Sling Tv Program for 3 months... This Fire Stick is probably the worst product I have ever used. When I am watching programs with it, it seems to screw with the router. It will disconnect the fire stick and every other device using the internet. Then you have to forget the wifi network and then re-establish the network. Then it will take about 4 minutes to reconnect my other devices back to the wifi...I thought this was a fluke, but I have tried three different fire sticks... And it is not my router.... I play Xbox 1 and use my other devices all the time on wifi and never have problems..When ever I use the stick, it kills all the connections to every device..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Justin"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "We love our Amazon fire tv,but the fire stick still has some bugs to work out. It freezes or says it cannot connect after watching TV for a day. You ha e to disconnect the power entirely to reboot it.
