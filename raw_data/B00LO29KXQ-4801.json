[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "None of the images, even on the box show that a power cord is needed. All my other cords are in the wall and not viable. It will be a major inconvenience to remove the TV from the wall and snake an extension cord up to power this devise.  The Fire Stick does work well and I am happy with the Amazon Prime and Netflix subscriptions. I think I would have gotten Cromecast which uses a USB port rather than an HTML port, eliminating the need for a power cord.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

I finally have amazon prime TV and Netflix on the same device! The connection is always good (Internet depending of course) and it's pretty simple to navigate. It does plug in via HDMI and yes it does have a mini USB power cord port off the side of it that you need to use in order for it to work.  Amazon seems to still be leaving that part out of their commercials and advertising.So dumb me, just plugged the thing into the HDMI port and was wondering why it wouldn't work. Then I dug into the box more and found the plug and power cord (complete palm to forehead moment). Other than that snafu (which was mostly my fault) it has worked flawlessly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Loyal Amazonion"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like this thing but, after owning it for a month and three days, the left directional button is starting to rub on the controller, making me worry that further degradation will lead to a stuck button.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Burdenofhope"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use and fun.

I snagged it when Amazon had it on sale for just $19 and it is so worth it.  I have Amazon Prime, so the amount of offerings you can get for free is staggering.  Set up was beyond simple, and we started using it immediately.  Well, well worth the cost.  Also download the free Fire TV Stick remote for your Android phone.
