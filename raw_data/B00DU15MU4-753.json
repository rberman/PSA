I find the remote to be a little difficult to get used to, but I'm sure I will.  For some reason, I thought the Fire TV would connect me to the internet and in effect make my TV a monitor for my computer via wi-fi connection.

Your help desk/customer service people have been very patient and excellent, going above and beyond.
