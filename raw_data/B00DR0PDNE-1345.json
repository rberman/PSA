You had to download an app to your phone/tablet, or use a computer. What I failed to understand from the description (I have to admit, I bought on the recommendation of a friend, and didn't spend a lot of time reading the information), is that you have to use a phone/tablet/computer to control the device. This is not a plug-and-play that allows you to go to a netflix app on your tv. You are, for example, going to the netflix app on your phone, but through this device, broadcasting it onto your tv.Since I intended to use this in a guest room, this was not a reasonable option, so it went back.
