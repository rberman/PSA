Yes, if I did a side-by-side comparison, I would probably notice that the Fire TV Stick is a little slower, and takes slightly more time to buffer, but for the money, it's one hell of a great device.If you have two TV's, I would probably recommend getting the full Amazon Fire TV for your primary TV, and the Fire TV Stick for your secondary TV. Or, if you travel a lot, the Amazon Fire TV Stick is a great way to get your movies at the hotel.If you have only one TV, it's kind of a tossup. The Fire TV Stick would definitely do the trick, but the one thing I do miss on the Fire TV Stick is the voice search remote, which you can get as an add-on, but after paying for that, you're almost up to the cost of the full Amazon Fire TV. The Amazon Fire TV also allows you to play more games than the Amazon Fire TV Stick. If that's important, go with the Amazon Fire TV.It's probably also worth noting that the voice search remote feels better constructed. Has a little more heft, and feels better in the hand. It's also worth noting that you can get the voice search capabilities using the Fire TV Android app (iOS is supposed to be \"coming soon\")All in all, highly recommend the Amazon Fire TV. It would make a great Christmas gift as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "Joe \"Programmer, Reader, Gamer\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works greAt. Love it.

I was told it was the developers fault because they did not develop the games and apps I purchased for the Fire TV (per customer service guy CC).  I get that, but really? What do I need the Fire Stick TV for then?  I can watch Amazon movies, apps, games, etc on the Kindle or my cell phone.  Why invest in this system?  I must be missing something.  I counted how many games I can get on the Fire Stick TV, 10 under the family heading.  So once again, I must have another device that does exactly the same thing as the 10 other devices that I already pay for.

Movies load very fast using my subscriptions ( hulu plus , netflix )I currently have 2 laptops on wifi ,2 note 4's and a ps4 running and movies are perfect.Remote: seems flimsy but honestly it works perfectly fine , voice commands and keyboard usage is great using the fire tv app on android. I do not like using the navigation on the app because its too delayed and the clicker works better for thatUsage: Navigation is fast, downloading apps was a breeze and I even have games that loaded from my cloud with i was surprisedAdditions: I like the face that it has a screensaver when not using. i like it if you pass out or just want something nice to play when your not watching anything.-Screen mirroring is a huge benefit for our note 4's BUT i wish it was a quick app versus having to go into the settings to enable it  but its fine.Overall: This is absolutely the best bang for the buck and unfortunately i didnt get 2 for the discounted price but still may get another at full price. I have no comparison to chromcast or roku but the fire tv stick is awesome in my opinion.the stick actually picks up more wifi access points in the neighborhood compared to my new laptop which is pretty sweet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Patryk"}]
