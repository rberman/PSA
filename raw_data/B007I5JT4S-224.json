If you have an iPhone, iPad or any Apple computer product, you should have an AppleTV. We ditched cable and use our AppleTV nearly exclusively. We also use our Playstation3 on occasion. This one we bought as a wedding gift and they love it. Everyone should have one in their home. We love streaming our PhotoStream pics on it when we have guest over. It's the easiest way to get your photos up and displayed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Craig G \"CG\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works good except that we haven't had it for a full year yet and the menu button on the remote isn't working properly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Theresa Beasley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "sisters have not complained about this xmas gift", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christopher A.
