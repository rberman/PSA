WiFi drops all the time. Every second time I try it it says lost connection. Netflix can't connect 3 out of 4 times I try. Constantly tries to load and fails. I installed Plex, very slow, disconnects etc...I thought problem with the router(I have attached modem with WiFi) I replaced it with netgear 3500  same problems. So I tend to believe its a stick itself. I'll ask for a replacement or refund.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Alided"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Used it only once so far and it worked perfectly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S. SILVERMAN \"Steve\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I had no problem installing this product, and all features work well.The only issue I have with this product is the placement of the Home Button on the remote.  For some reason whenever I pause a movie, I somehow hit the Home Button instead of the Pause/Play Button, which brings the display back to the Home screenThis requires me to go back into the  app (Netflix) I was in.The Home button should be positioned in a different place on the remote. I highly recommend this product to others.  It has worked flawlessly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charlie The Pug"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got this when it was $19 to replace my roku stick and couldn't be happier.

Is it perfect? No, but at the $19 it cost me it was money well spent. Comparing this to other streaming devices I own (Samsung Bluray, Apple TV & 2 Vizio smart tv's) it works very well. It's very responsive and I have had no issues streaming. I would definitely buy again even at the $39 price point.Update: I am still enjoying this several months in and I've ordered a second one for a small tv in the kitchen.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dustin Haralson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far so good! We use it everyday! Works great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CaliberCable \"Signature\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I like it. It had me a bit frustrated for a half hour trying to get it to accept the network password and moving around the onscreen keypad. I finally unplugged the power cable for a few seconds, plugged it back in and it connected right away. I went to the website support to learn that the upper ring on the remote is a navigation button most useful for typing on the keypad. Boy did I feel stupid. That's all behind me now and I was really glad to see that, like the Kindle fire HD, it's possible to sideload other apps. So now the Fire TV Stick can access all the drives on the network where I keep all the good stuff. My TV is built in so another thing I was glad of is the remote does not have to be line of site, it does work very well through the wall. The one thing I would like for it to do is disconnect from the network without having to \"forget\" it, thus having to retype the password with my new friend, the remote ring. Maybe it's just me but I really don't like leaving all these electronic devices plotting against me when I'm not there to supervise. If you have a Prime account the Fire TV Stick is a nice stand alone device to use, just plug it in and leave it there. If you don't have a Prime account, get the stick anyway and go get some apps to load onto it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AmazonB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome and got a great price.
