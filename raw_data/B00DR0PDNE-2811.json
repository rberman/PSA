I had hoped it would basically turn my television into a wireless monitor. It doesn't really do that.It does a great job displaying Netflix or Youtube videos which is what is in fact made to do and \"as described\". The technology was just a little different than I expected. I had hoped to be able to put in a DVD or even use my flatscreen television as a giant monitor.I had made the assumption that it was some kind of wireless HDMI device, which it is..just not to the extent that I had hoped for I guess.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jacqueline Waters"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Changed my way of looking at TV.
