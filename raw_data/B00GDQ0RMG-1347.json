I've had it for three months now and have yet to make it through ONE night of streaming, JUST ONE, without having any streaming issues. I constantly have to disconnect, reconnect to the internet to get this device to work. It's a complete JOKE. No, it's not my internet that's the problem, it's the device. I live in an apartment complex and have tried it on my internet and my neighbor's internet, took it to a friend's house and tried it on their internet. I very rarely experience any issues whatsoever trying to stream content on any of my other devices.
