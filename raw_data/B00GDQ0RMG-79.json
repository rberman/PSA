It got very hot like a fire stick. Thank God my husband found it first thing in the morning. When I got up all my Kindles Fires were off too. and when I went to pull out the Fire Stick it was so hot I had to put it down. When I call Amazon the guy told me that I should have stayed on that station for a half hour to an hour to make sure the Fire Stick was off. Or it could turn it self back on. I do not need a product that can turn itself back on. Thanks anyways. No Fire Sticks in this house, they need a on and off switch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dragonflydance"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great investment", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Natasha Robertson"}]
