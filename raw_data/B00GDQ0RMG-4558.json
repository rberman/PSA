At first we had issues with it not registering. We ended up calling customer service and they fixed it. So it worked, slowly. Didn't use it during the week (I binge watch on the weekends) and it stopped working. So I removed it and reregisted it and ended up calling customer service again and they couldn't fix it. So I ended up calling the kiosk and they took it back even though I threw out the box. This new one works flawlessly with the help of the Almond range extender that I bought. Now I'm completely satisfied. Awesome product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome! puts every movie ever made in the palm of your hands!

Before you say it's my Internet, it's not. I've checked. The remote super lags, sometimes it doesn't even work. Everything I play (netflix, hulu, etc) has those buffeting type lags. It worked fine the first few days, smooth, no problem with the controller. But now not so much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica Saefong"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Fire TV Stick is nice alternative to Roku and a great addition to my Samsung plasma. Great user interface. Much less clunky than a Roku or integrated SmartTV interface. Loads quickly and keeps good connection with WiFi. Hulu Plus app could use some updating to make it less buggy. Use with surround sound receiver is problematic at times as sound takes a second or two to initially play from stick, through speakers. Overall a great device though. I'm considering getting a second one. Will throw out my old Xbox 360 as soon as Amazon adds HBOGO app to TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "on the air"}]
