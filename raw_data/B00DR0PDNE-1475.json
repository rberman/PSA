[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "It has been almost a year since I bought this, I bought it with this in mind \"It's a google product, it's probably something Google wants to try to see if it would work\", so it's $35, I'll pay $35 to beta test this toy.  At first, I did a few youtube and hulu plus with it and there is really nothing else I could use it for.  Hulu Plus was easier with my roku than chromecast.  Then couple months later, there were plex support, so suddenly I can watch all my home video collection with this thing.  Then later, there is popcorn times support, so this chromecast is just becoming more and more useful to me.I can see how this can be completely useless, but to me, this $35 is one of the best $35 I spent.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ed Tse"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Incredibly useful, though not quite as amazing as I had originally thought. You need to set them up at first to get them on your home wireless network. This, which while easy, means it's not quite as convenient as being able to pack it up with you and move locations (friend or family's home) and stream right out of your pocket. It is simple enough that if you need to do that, however, it could be done with just a few minutes setup. The app paired on my phone works like a charm, and the only time I've ever experienced lag was when casting my screen directly without the app having the capability built in. Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube all have native casting support, which works great. The ease of use combined with the price means I'll be buying another at some point to keep around as either a spare gift, or a useful tool that's in reach.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thomas A.
