I contacted Roku on their support site on my computer and got into a terrible situation.  I was transferred to a company called vTECH who took over my computer and put $735 on my credit card all the while I was protesting and asking for control of my computer. My credit card company called me and told me I was probably involved in a big scam and deleted the charge.  I think Roku should provide reliable, honest support for their product.  I had to cancel my credit card, report this scam to my local police department, the state Attorney General, the Consumer Protection agency, the credit reporting agencies and now I have to change my payment schedules on many accounts...all because I had faith in a company called Roku.  AND after all that, I returned the Roku streaming stick and we still do not have Netflix!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "J.

He isn't good with tecnology so Google's Chromecast was not a option because of how you need to use it. I needed something which brought its own remote, no using a smartphone app that could get him confused. I found out that Roku Streaming Stick and Amazon Fire TV Stick could do the job done. The Fire TV was my first option but was out of stock until February 15th and his birthday was Feb-4th. And the end I chose the Roku.Before Buying it, I noticed that it said that some channels were not available for all the countries. I decided to check in their website if there were more information about the channels available for my country (Dominican Republic) and found nothing. Then, I sign up to see if I can add netflix to my account but it didn't work. Every channels I tried to add the web said \"We're sorry. At this time, we don't support adding channels from the web for your region.\", which left me at the same point that I started.I start thinking that I am already subscribed to netflix using a credit card issued here (Dom. Rep.), Netflix is one of the channels that they (Roku) promote the most even it is in the remote by default. I decided to buy it. As you may imagine, it was a bad idea. Not only Netflix is not available, not even a single recognized channels is.This might be pretty good for USA residents but it shouldn't be sold to outsiders, it's just a waste of money. I would have preferred buying a Chromecast and dealing with weeks of teaching (my father). And yes, it says \"Not all content is available in all countries\" but even if you ask, you won't find out if it works for you until it is too late.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "A.
