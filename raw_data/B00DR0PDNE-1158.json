IE you have to use your phone, tablet, or other device to use the Chromecast.  This isn't normally a problem, unless you consider that using your phone/tablet ties that item up until you're done using the Chromecast; however, with Amazon or Roku, you can use that product to view whatever it is you're wanting to view, and not tie up your phone/tablet.  Something to consider.

It worked great for a while. I bought a Netgear R8000 router because i thought my wifi signal was weak.

I have over 20 2.4 ghz routers around my house so all i get is this thing searching for data all the time. For the price I cant complain but it doesnt work even for streaming music on my home theater.
