[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great Potential, so it gets 5 stars. I know this may seem contrary to what you might expect, but I want this device to be successful, so I'm rating it high despite my troubles.I can't get my device to connect to my router (which supports an xbox one, two laptops, and a few smartphones just fine) most of the time. Looking  online, it seems that the fire tv stick is very susceptible to white noise. Unfortunately I live in an apartment complex, so I have tv's and routers and all kinds of digital signals all around me which bombard my fire tv stick. So the only time I can use it really is about 2 am when everyone is asleep and their devices are off.I love this stick. I have gotten to use it a few times and it has been amazing. However, getting a message that it is not connected to the internet (even though my router is fine) and that I should restart my router every day all day is pretty lame. I hope Amazon comes out with a fix to this (somehow). I would really like to enjoy this wonderful product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Justin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Amazon Fire TV stick.
