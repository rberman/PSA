Having owned several Roku boxes that have worked perfect for the past three years I assumed that Amazon would have made a decent product, I was wrong!  The USB Fire TV stick overheats as it is super HOT to the touch and the video is constantly freezing although the audio continues to play.  If I start TV show on HULU I only get to see the first two minutes and the screen either freezes or goes black but sound keeps playing so you are only able to hear the show and not watch it.  For the extra $60 I will buy another Roku box because the Amazon Fire TV Stick is a total piece of junk.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Janet L.
