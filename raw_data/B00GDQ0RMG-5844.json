[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Using Amazon's game controller remote eliminates lost remotes!!! --My kids often misplace small remotes.  Amazon's game controller remote WILL link to the Fire TV stick, and it is almost impossible to lose it in a living room!!!  The voice remote @ $29 will also link to it.I really like being able to play music through Amazon and the Fire TV stick.  For about 30 minutes of nonuse, the Fire TV Stick displays a slide show of really beautiful scenes!We have both the Fire TV stick and Amazon's regular Fire TV device --- unless you're a gamer, the less-expensive Fire TV Stick will probably work just fine for you! ---", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "craigery"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For such a small device, the Fire TV Stick really delivers. If you're an Amazon Prime member, then you'll find oodles of TV and movie offerings. You'll also find many of the streaming offerings available via other devices, including Netflix, Hulu+, and Crackle. The menu system is well laid out and easy to navigate. The streaming and viewing experience is excellent. Now the only thing that would improve this device would be to marry the Apple and Amazon ecosystems so that you could access digital content from either service over this one device. Perhaps one day! In any case, the performance of this device is superb and it would be difficult to complain.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike C."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wow, It  works so much better than what I expected. So much better than Chromcast.The fire stick really allowed me to enjoy the full extend of my Amazon Prime membership.I spend the whole day figuring out everything, and it has been a lot of fun.Pros:The UI was very informative and easy to navigate.The  remote even thou it's simple, it's very functional.I love how easy it was  to browse my photos in the amazon cloud drive.Very easy access to the Amazon Prime Videos.Cons:no on/off buttonno IOS app YET?Overall I'm very happy was my purchase of the Fire TV Stick.The $20OFF for prime membership was the first reason for my purchase to try it out, but have to say if I knew how good this was, I would gladly pay at the full price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "X.

That's what drew me to the Fire TV Stick. It replaced an outdated HDMI wifi converter for a Samsung TV.First - this thing is loud. I watch TV at night when my partner is sleeping. The clicking noise the remote makes is unnecessarily loud - imagine trying to click through 100 episodes of your favorite show. Terrible.Second - there's no backlight on the remote and there's no tactile feedback (small nubs) on any of the buttons to help orient you.Third - the stick lost connection 3 times during the first hours of use. The only way to fix it was to unplug it from its power source and wait 3 seconds. The feedback provided by the device when this happened was unnecessarily obtuse. I resorted to online forums for help.Fourth - the browsing experience is subpar. It feels like work rather than a joy to browse for something to watch. Browsing shouldn't feel like you're looking through a spreadsheet...Again, I love Amazon. I've been a Prime member for years. For me, the Fire TV stick is a great concept and I'll be sticking around for at least a few versions to see if Amazon can nail it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Cassie L.
