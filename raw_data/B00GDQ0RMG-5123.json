It's safe to say that the Fire Stick TV is an amazing bargain!  So far, this product streams all of this media flawlessly.  I have found very little delay in getting video to begin playing.  I use the Fire TV Stick in my basement gym and my wireless router is one floor up.  Even being a floor away this thing performs very very well.

Love the ease and the video steaming capabilities.  Unfortunately the parental controls is lacking.  Turing on parental controls requires the user to enter the five digit pin number to use even the basic items that are free.  It would be nice to have a function that only requires a pin when something is going to be purchased a movie, app, or in-app purchase.  Makes it impossible to allow children to use the device even to watch free G rated movies unless the parents are there to enter the pin.BTW, when entering the pin the numbers are present, so the kids see exactly what you entered.  Have to give it two stars for the programmers not thinking of those users that may want to protect from children freely charging the credit card on file.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "James H Quackenbush"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Everything works great except that even though the wireless connection says it's \"very good\" I have trouble getting the streaming to work correctly even though the connection with my laptop being in the same room shows 14mbps which should be plenty for 1) fast buffering and 2) HD streaming but the Fire Stick seems to want to have a much faster connection to stream correctly", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Edgar Angulo-diaz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We just started using it but have already watched five movies that we enjoyed a lot.
