[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic product, I wanted something simple to replace my Apple TV and this was a fantastic option. I think this is 10x better in almost every way except that most if not all of the applications I have used do not have auto play and that gets very frustrating when I want to have Netflix on in the background while I am doing work. But I guess that's not the chrome casts fault but the developers.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nitzan Levi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "excelente producto", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elias Chicas"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Does what it supposed to.
