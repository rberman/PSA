I could just hook up my HDMI wire to my laptop with better results. It was supposed to make my life easier but it doesn't. I can't watch anything on Netflix for more than like two minutes without it stopping to reload. I didn't think I needed to pay 99 dollars for the box which I'm not doing. So i'm very agitated with the product in that regards. It has made streaming like AOL dialup in the early 2000sAlso, Hulu Plus NEVER streams right on the fire stick. I still have to use my laptop to watch it. It is steadily becoming a waste of 40 bucks. With Amazon you have to pay the 60 dollar difference I guess it you want things to stream correctly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "kia"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Product works very well, easy to install and setup... unfortunately a large number of shows require an additional subscription or a small fee... even for prime members. .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeff Arnold"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Took over an hour to initalize, then failed to see any wirless networks.

I seemed to work perfectly for me until it was being used for long periods of time.  It would freeze.  I figured out if I went directly to settings and then to system.  Go down to restart.  It would restart the firestick and at the same time resolve any issues.  Works perfectly after that.

SLING TV is a pay per month service and not affiliated with the DISH Anywhere app.  The Fire TV devices are wonderful however Amazon needs to do a better job in explaining about their 3rd party apps and where to find out more information about them.  I have already voiced my concerns with DISH however since they are not the creator of the App they have little say in the matter.  Had I done a little more thorough research I would have been able to make a more informed buying decision.
