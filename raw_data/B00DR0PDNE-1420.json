People complaining about not being able to cast videos from their cell phones and what not, well maybe that was the case, with the cell phones now days such as my Nexus 5 i can easily cast pictures, videos I can even cast my entire cell phone. And there's also this app called \"Plex\", it's just amazing, it lets you manage all of your media that you have on your computer stream it through the plex server to your Chromecast, and it looks really professionally done it looks sort of like Netflix. I purchased 4 Chromecast's for all of my TV's. As i mentioned, don't be discouraged by the bad reviews, this dongle is worth every penny.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Nenad Jovanovic"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "No need much of explanation, it is simple awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Senthil"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wonderful device", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "PHILG"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Overall great, especially for the price.
