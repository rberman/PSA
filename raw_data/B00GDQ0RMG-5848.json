A majority of the currently supported apps can be found on the product description so check if you are concerned  it might not do everything you want.  The ability to sideload apps makes this small dongle a pretty powerful little computing device.  I had XBMC up and running in about 10 minutes and was streaming hd content over a local network without delay.  People complaining about HDMI not powering the device obviously can't read and don't understand why that would be a bad idea.  While HDMI does have a 5v power pin, it really isn't intended to power a device.  The power pin is used primarily to trigger signals... like when to turn on a tv.  Even if the 5v could work as a power source, it wouldn't be good for powering a strong device without a battery.  While 5v can charge a phone,  it is still just supplying a small amount of power compared to a 12v wall adapter.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Have had this for a couple weeks now and I love it.

Alder"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "My new Fire TV Stick arrived a few days earlier than expected. Yeah!1. My first problem was getting the battery compartment open on the remote. VERY difficult. Although the plastic is sturdy, I certainly didn't want to break it. There is no helpful indentation or grooved surface to help you get a grip and slide that open. So that was a small frustration.2. Next, the instructions seem to 'imply' that the Stick will work 'if' close enough to a router. Well, my router is 3-feet from my TV HDMI ports and the stick would not work. So I plugged in the power source. To the credit of the designers, the entire device with power brick and cable is incredibly compact.3. Getting through the setup process took just ten minutes. The only problem I had was I entered the password wrong for my WiFi and had to repeat that step. The ten minutes includes me watching the 4-minute orientation video.4. To fully test operation, I attempted to launch a Prime movie and I got the Blue Screen of Death (BDOD) - \"HDCP Unauthorised. Content Disabled.\" (Yes, British spelling!) After 20-minutes of trying remedies from the Internet, I used the help feature to call Amazon. My call went through without delay and a representative was able to help me solve the problem is under ten minutes.It turns out, the Stick does not like other HDMI items plugged in. I use all three HDMI ports on my TV. Temporarily unplugging my other devices solved the BSOD. Apparently Amazon thinks people will somehow steal digital content. Once the BSOD was cleared, I have everything plugged back in and fully operational and the error has not manifested again.5. Operation is very straight forward and simple. The variety of content is well worth the purchase price and I like that I can easily transport it to a friend's house, etc.The net cost for my Fire TV Stick is actually a savings because I have eliminated other paid services. My monthly entertainment costs are now LESS.UPDATE: JAN 1, 2015Downgraded from 5-stars to 1-starReason for downgrade... the BSOD - Blue Screen Of Death is back. The reason for the BSOD given by Amazon customer support is 'the device is detecting other devices plugged into other HDMI ports and it thinks you are trying to copy content.'INSANE and I'm calling it a lie.It is completely unreasonable in today's technology to think that the Fire Stick will be the only device plugged in. There are multiple HDMI ports for a reason! People have DVD, Blu-Ray, Game Consoles, Sound Systems, etc. plugged in. Does Amazon think we should unplug those items anytime we want to watch something through the Stick? Does anyone at product development understand how difficult this can be. Think of the possibilities: a disabled person whose existence is regulated to a wheelchair. How easy do you think it is for someone in that condition to manipulate even a 'small' 36\" television without assistance.INSANEIn my humble opinion, anyone who is going to steal content is not going to be stopped by this insane programming restriction. Therefore, why inconvenience, frustrate, and destroy customer relations with thousands of other consumers by presenting the BSOD just because they happen to use multiple HDMI devices.Amazon, if you are listening, a device update needs to address this immediately -- if you value your customers. Do you?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "9/9", "author": "Don Uhrig"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Had the Fire Stick for less than 24 hours and had the same authentication problem. Every other device I have will keep their connection to the router but not the Fire Stick. I rebooted the router and the modem several times. In looking at my WiFi analyzer the signal strength is very good. Issue is with the Fire Stick. On top of that Amazon was very happy to accept my money on the release date but delay delivering the Fire Stick while at the same time they released it at Best Buy. Tried several times to explain to Amazon staff and their best response was \"Well you never know whether a 3rd party site might be selling used items\" - what a farce of customer service and of product design.
