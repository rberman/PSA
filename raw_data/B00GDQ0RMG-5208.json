As of 1/3/2015, the Twitch app is horrible! It doesn't even allow users to login with their Twitch account to view the (potentially less-popular) streams that they prefer. Users are stuck watching popular streams picked by someone else. Overall, FireTV Stick is nice, but I already had all the other app functionality on my TV before I bought the FireTV Stick. I had much higher hopes from Amazon. Unless/until Amazon significantly imrpoves their Twitch app, I'll consider my purchase as a big disappointment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Doug M"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Using it Now!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Greg Beck"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Would be great if you guys would support vudu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "matthew langford"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great way to view on-line content.  It works very well and is much faster than getting content using my Sony Blu-ray player.  Only problem I've noted is that it does occasionally \"freeze\" or lock up on initial access and has to be \"re-booted\" (remove/restart power).  But once it is running there are no problems.  Uses RF remote instead of IR which is great because it will probably be hidden in an HDMI jack on the back of your TV.  But if you use a universal remote like the Logitech Harmony, as I do, you won't be able to control it.  However you can set it a source device on the Harmony remote to get everything up an running with one touch and then use the little RF remote to browse.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Grumpy \"net pro\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love the Amazon fire stick!

It opens readily, as do the various programs, but it the streaming is a little herky-jerky.  It's not the smooth streaming I've come to enjoy on my Chromecast device.
