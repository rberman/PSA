If you have Prime, it takes even longer to load - hours and hours.  The unit seriously overheats with the AC power adapter and is supplied with a very short hdmi m/f extension that doesn't help trying to get a better Wi-Fi signal position.  The remote control is a joke, and a ridiculous design for installing batteries.  All in all, this is just pure junk and a complete waste of money and both hardware and firmware are junk.  I'm only giving it a star because I have to.  Don't waste your time and money.  Once again, Mr. Bezos has ripped me off.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Tony V"}]
