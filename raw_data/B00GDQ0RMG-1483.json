I was looking to cut costs and I am already a prime member so I gave this a try.  It is actually saving me money in several ways as my family wants to stay home and watch \"TV\".  The amount of programs available is really amazing.  We didn't have any problem setting it up.  Although getting it to sync with my IPad is a hit and miss thing - I am not sure what I am doing wrong.  We only have 1.5mb internet speed in a very rural mountain area and have only had a problem once with streaming.  It was the Aviator movie and it is very long, so the break was welcomed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "peggy johnston"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cindy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works very well", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brett Bussing \"splicer\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It was great.
