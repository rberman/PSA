[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very nice device with a few small issues. Definitely needs more apps but my work around is to stream from my kindle fire and mirror to my fire tv. Not sure if this is more of the fire tv issue or a kindle issue but I have a lot of issues streaming between the two. Powering down and rebooting the kindle and the fire tv seems to solve the issue. My other issue is why can't l seem to make it work with my soundbar. Other than these issues if you are a prime member it's definitely worth your time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Has no space for a lot of different games.Awesome for what it is.Amazon based.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jason"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Isabel"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "When this thing works, it's fantastic. The beefy hardware is fast, my son likes playing games on it without issue. However. This is my second fire TV, and they've both had the same problem. Once it goes to sleep, I have no audio when it wakes. I have to unplug the optical cable, reset the sound settings, and power cycle until audio comes back, then I can plug it back in to NY receiver and enjoy audio.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GuardLK \"Banana Phone!\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far so good.

I use an OTA antenna along with Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime subscriptions. I have a non-smart TV in my living room and I was looking for a device that I could add to the TV to get Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime along with games. Fire TV is advertised as having 8Gb of storage however only 5.5Gb is usable. You also need to keep 500Mb free for system updates so really you only get 5Gb of usable space. Fire TV box did not originally support external thumb drives but they now do. Usable space is still an issue though. It does not allow you to install app data on the usb drive. The native app and app updates get installed on the USB drive but the local drive is for saving additional app data like additional content and in game achievements. This means that Fire TV still only has 5Gb of usable space for app data. GTA San Andreas for example stores the app (50Mb) on the USB drive and the app data (2.5Gb) on the local drive. Just that one app takes up half of the usable space of the local drive. I just have Netflix, Hulu, iHeartRadio, Plex and GTA San Andreas installed and Fire TV says that I'm low on space and to uninstall some apps. I was looking forward to USB drive functionality but it did not help one bit.Pros:Easy to use interface.No buffering when streaming video.I can cast my Nexus 4 and 7 (Android Lollipop 5.0) to my TV screen.Supports external thumb drivesCons:Only 5Gb of usable space. Additional USB drive does not help.Voice search only searches Amazon Prime (not Netflix or Hulu)No way to filter between free and pay TV and Movies within Amazon Prime.No way to setup/update wireless settings when a wired network connection is plugged in.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Enodrano"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "love it only thing that is missing is amazon prime music", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "The dude"}]
