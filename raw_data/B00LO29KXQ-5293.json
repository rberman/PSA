It took a little longer than I was hoping, mostly because there were so many updates to do. But that's to be expected and really, I can't complain too much.It works great with all the apps I use on a regular basis. I primarily watch Hulu, but I occasionally use Amazon Prime Instant Streaming, Netflix, and Pandora. They all work flawlessly. Any issues that I've had have likely been because of my Internet service.The only blip I've had was some strange sound issues that occurred for a few days. We thought it was due to the Internet service, but once we restarted the Amazon Fire TV Stick, all issues cleared right up. We haven't had the same issues since.I'll definitely continue to use this for quite some time to come.

The initial setup required an Amazon account to use it and mine was already tied up to my account out of the box. The fire tv stick is better than my Chromecast because of the real remote and a searchable user interface. Navigating the UI is easy and the streaming is flawless so far. New apps must be purchased through the Amazon app store. So if you have kids, I recommend setting up a PIN to prevent any surprise charges. Unlike a conventional IR remote, the fire tv remote works on Bluetooth and so it doesn't need to be pointed at the tv to operate - this is great. I give it a 4 star because the connection between the remote and stick seems to be lost at times (navigation goes unresponsive). The other negative is, I never got the miracast to work on my fire tv stick, however Amazon says the stick is miracast enabled.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Yogi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wonderful implementation of the concept of a streaming device. It has a fast processor and it feels like it. My only concern is that HBO GO is not yet available; however, many HBO series are available on Amazon Prime (which I have).I do not know what the experience is without Prime but I suspect it would be fine. I currently don't really use Prime Videos or Music that much with this device but I do use Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, Plex and TWIT and it works great.I own the AppleTV and Roku (1&2 series boxes) and now this. I purchased for $19 as a special for Prime subscribers. They all have strengths and weaknesses but this is a solid placement from Amazon! Roku is still my favorite... but by only a hair.My only cons are that I only wish Plex was not a purchase App. I also hope the app store / Channels get more numerous as time rolls on.

But it shouldn't be!  It's that little \"oomph\" that makes a real difference as you move around the interface - making it feel much faster than ChromeCast (which I also own) - at least from Amazon Prime Videos.Installation did have some troubles - wi-fi kept dropping out constantly.  But after a day or two, this cleared up (firmware upgrade?  not sure.)Netflix has lost connection a time or two, which forces me to enter my credentials again.  Annoying - especially without a keyboard.It's nice to have Plex on the system, too.  My only complaint is that \"casting\" from the Kindle Fire HDX Plex app to the Fire TV is currently not supported.  Hopefully that will come in time.  You can still get to everything using the remote (when I can find it...)I find myself mostly using the \"casting\" option from my Kindle Fire HDX or iPad instead of the Fire TV interface.
