Not only is it fun and useful enough to recommend to friends, it's also inexpensive enough to give as a simple gift. I can't really speak to its ease of use since I'm somewhat techie. That said, I have had no problems using it from my Android tablet and phone as well as my Macbook Air and PC running Windows 7. Some people have pointed out that an Apple TV or next-gen game console offer the same functionality, but you're unlikely to buy such a device for every TV in the house. The Chromecast is inexpensive and simple enough that you can put one on all your televisions not hooked up to media servers and still access everything everywhere!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JCo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Have to have a router to use it and is a great product.
