[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I probably have more than 10 different ways already to view streaming media and movies... so why not add another?I currently have my laptops (Macbook Pro and PC), a PS3/4, a Wii u, a PS Vita, a 3DS, a smartphone, 2 tablets, a Chrome cast, an Apple TV, and a smart tv... now, what does the fire stick bring that my current devices can't? Honestly, nothing. It does what any of my other devices can. Regardless, it's a nice little addition to the guest room that I bought it for.First off, the interface is fast and very responsive. It's a lot faster than my outdated 2010 Apple tv. You simply plg the USB shaped stick into any available HDMI slot, plug in the AC adapter into the stick, and plug the other into an available outlet and you're good to go.When you turn it on, it will prompt you to register your stick to your Prime account (If you have one). This takes about 2-3 minutes. This is mainly so you can watch all of the movies that you have on queue or want to purchase.I chose a random movie and clicked play. The movie started almost immediately, and the movie played in HD pretty well. There were a few drops where I saw it drop from HD to SD. I guess that was a latency issue. For the most part, it was pretty stable.The sound was loud and clear during my movie playback.The remote that comes with the stick has a very simple layout. The remote too is responsive.Like with most other streaming devices, you can download apps and games. I downloaded a few apps to watch clips and such, and the apps were available on the main screen after it is downloaded. I don't really have any complaints about the device. I got it on the pre-launch Prime member exclusive $19.99 price, so there's really nothing to complain about.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ethan H."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the fire stick, its amazing.

Today I added the H2 (History Channel) and it wanted me to activate. Specifically, it says \"Free access to all HISTORY and H2 content when you activate\". You have to go online -- address provided -- and type in an Activation Code. When you get to that point (in my case, on my iPad), you have to choose your cable provider before it will activate. Guess what ... Cox Cable is not listed as a provider. I searched online for information regarding this and found my exact query answered already by someone from Cox. The answer was they have no plans to support that action.So, I am apparently out of luck watching History and H2 and probably a bunch of other channels like so inhibited. I'm not sure where to turn, but I am NOT A HAPPY CAMPER with this shortcoming. Unknown whose fault this is. I just know Amazon promotes all these apps and I guess I missed the fine print saying \"some cable subscribers need not apply\"!!!The bottom line remains, BUYER BEWARE!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thom"}]
