Highly recommend for anyone who has Amazon Prime.  Don't forget to get the game controller also, you will need it if you really want to take advantage of all the things that Prime has to offer on your Fire stick.  Although the specs on the stick are lower than the Fire TV box, there is no noticeable loss of quality or performance from our perspective.  The little controller is now the most fought over controller in the house.

I also purchased the Fire Stick for $20 as part of a promotion.The stick is great if you have a lot of Amazon content, photos in the cloud, and the ability to mirror devices via Miracast.  The WiFi connection is not as good as I hoped it would be (particularly as the TV's connection is nothing to write home about), but again, I can mirror my screen in a pinch.  The remote app is...interesting, but I'll put that review on its own product page.  Overall, I have not used the Fire Stick as much as I thought I would, but this is partially due to the placement of the TV it is on and partially due to the lack of FreeTime.The Fire Stick is definitely worth $20, and I think it is also worth $40 in general.  For my particular wants, I think the Fire  TV box would actually have been a better purchase, if not for the promotion.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AudibleQun, a.k.a.
