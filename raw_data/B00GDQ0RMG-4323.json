This thing was dead and not working when I opened the box.The only thing it did was over heat to the point of burning down my house.Worst item I have ever bought on Amozon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Ryan Sethman"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Not as easy to hook up as the commercials would have you believe. It comes with a small \"extension cord\" which gives you a couple extra inches to try to make it to an outlet. However, if you don't have one pretty close, then you have to use an actual extension cord, which I can't imagine is too good, and it looks like tacky. I have a power surge strip connected to my outlet by the TV but still had to use the extension cord that came included and the power strip now hangs off the floor by several inches, it looks stellar. Do you notice none of the photos show cords hanging off the stick? Yeah. Exactly.I got it because I want to be able to watch Amazon Prime movies and my Apple TV doesn't support that, since Apple likes to make it nearly impossible to use anything but their products. It did work immediately upon plugging in, it recognized my account without requiring me to enter the information, which is nice. I am interested in seeing the \"free\" movie selection that Amazon Prime offers, to see if this pays for itself over time. It wasn't expensive, which is refreshing, butif their selection is as limited as Netflix, then it's somewhat pointless to have.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DK \"TBlythe\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My TV has rabbit ears. I get the three channels that I watch, very clearly. Why do I need this thing?I watch NETFLIX on my Kindle Fire HD and Prime movies too. Why do I need this thing?I looked at the reviews on Amazon and saw how many there were and I got curious. Can that many people be that thrilled about this thing?Saw that it wasn't available until Feb 2015 so I put it on my wish list. I waited and read more reviews, wish list is free and easy to change.Curiosity finally got the best of me and I ordered it. Got a shipping date. Got a new shipping date. Waited for the postman to deliver on my new promised date. Didn't happen.The next day it came. I opened it and stuck it on my TV and plugged in the power. Nothing. Did I get a broken one? Are all those people lying?Checked my TV and discovered I had not selected the correct input for the TV. Fixed that and got a picture of this thing asking me to log into my WiFi. I did.THIS THING IS AWESOME. I have been living under a rock. Why didn't someone drag me by the neck and make me get one of these things before. Maybe they just couldn't find my rock.I am glad I didn't get cable, this thing has more stuff than I will ever watch and except for the initial cost is basically free. I know the WiFi is not free but I use that for other things so for this it is free.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "night player"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the ability to never have to pay for cable again.
