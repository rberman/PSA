I bought this because Google advertised this as a unit that could broadcast baseball games from your computer to your TV. I hooked the unit up and to my TV. Then I opened up my subscription to MLB (Major League Baseball) waited for my favorite team to start the game. I proceeded to get MLB going on my TV, when I tried to get the actual game stared it would not access the live action. I tried every way to get it from the menu, but each time I clicked on to the action it would jump away. Then I put a request in to the Google browser, \"How do I get  the games on MLB from my Google Chromecast\" Then I arrived at a  page where everyone was complaining about the same issue not being able to access baseball from the Chromecast unit.

The ability to just plug this thing in and be able to watch Netflix/Youtube while using my phone as a remote control is almost magical, and this is coming from a tech guy. Mirroring almost any tab from Chrome is also a really neat feature if you want to watch a video from a website that is not supported natively by ChromeCast, such as Amazon or Vimeo.I wish more applications supported ChromeCast but hopefully the situation will continue improving in the future.
