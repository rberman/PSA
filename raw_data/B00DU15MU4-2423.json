[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love, love, love my Fire TV.  Bought it for the free month trial, but don't want to send it back - so many good shows, and it works so much better than Netflix.  Would like to see more shows on it, but I am sure it's coming.  Set up was easy and the whole not needing a line of sight for the remote to work is great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "cfmom"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing!!  Quick and easy to locate shows we want to watch.  LOVE the voice feature - of course we had to search for Gary Busey.  It features movies, TV shows, games, apps, music - everything in one place.  And with Amazon Prime, much of the things we like to watch are free.  Extremely easy to use as well.  Highly recommended and the price is right.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Val"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Gotta say this is awesome. They say big things come in small packages and this takes the prize.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Sharon Sanderson \"NanaSharon\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like it, it set up fast as promised. Everything quickly responds. I do wish it had other Apps available like TWC TV and HBO go like Roku. Most Smart TV's have Amazon as one of the options to connect to as well as most of the others that Fire TV does. This is better for less experienced users. The voice feature you have to hold the microphone button down and remember to speak clearly and not to fast.  Adding the other apps as I mentioned would put it over the top. Hint to Amazon. See what you can do about adding those I mentioned please. I'd recommend it for inexperienced users and even for more experienced users as it goes right to the icon screens.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Maureen Fink"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this device, especially the voice recognition feature.
