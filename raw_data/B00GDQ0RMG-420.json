It is easy to hook up, set up and use.  The picture is clear and there are options, like games, that we may or may not use.  Unfortunately, the primary reason we purchased the Amazon Fire TV Stick was to replace our old Roku device which occasionally had delays while we were watching a program.  Like advertised, we do not experience long uploading breaks like we sometimes experienced with the Roku.  We DO however, experience at least 5-10 skips during each one-hour program we watched.  These skips are like a record player skip where the show may repeat the last 10 seconds or advance 3-10 seconds.  I was hoping that this new device would provide us with uninterrupted programing that the new technology promised to do but is not and therefore give it a 3 star rating based on performance.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BBC"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Does exactly what it's supposed to do.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel Vane"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Value with Prime far surpasses Netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Stephen Bryant"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got exactly what I paid for easy set up as well", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James Huff"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent value, easy to set up and easy to use.
