Until my purchase, I have been using an HDMI cable to mirror my laptop\u2019s screen to my TV; this worked efficiently, though I was looking for more of a wireless type connection. I purchased 2 of these devices, one as a gift to a friend (in Canada), and one for myself (in the U.S.). Thus far, the product works as expected.I typically use my Nexus 7 tablet to mirror Netflix or YouTube via Chromecast to my TV. I love having the capability of using almost any device as a remote for Chromecast. Though, for some this may be an issue, as you will need to always have some sort of device to control Chromecast. Chromecast is quite small, cheap, and is definitely a \u201cbang for your buck.\u201d After receiving the product, I was prompted to install a firmware update; unfortunately, this firmware update took several hours to install. I was quite eager to use the device, though was extremely bothered by such a long wait. I do however appreciate such an update. Now, despite that, I highly recommend Chromecast to anyone who is looking to replace their wired connection (ie: HDMI cable).Pros:- Easy to useI particularly like the YouTube queue feature. It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like; it allows one to queue videos (in a list) to be automatically played in order. - Easy to set up - Compact - CheapCons: - Slow firmware update (for me it took several hours to download) - Limited to Chromecast\u2019s apps and Google chrome for streaming - Netflix may freeze every so often in order to re-buffer the videoI hope this helps a consumer make a better informed purchase.

Even with excellent Internet speed, it plays about 1 out of every 10 YouTube videos part way before failing. The other 9 times it just returns an error message. I've reset it to factory specs, restarted, and given it every chance to work.

Nothing much to say. Took a couple tries to get it connected to my router (Actiontec, on Telus in Canada). One thing buyers should know is that tab casting from the Chrome browser is not perfect, at least yet. I had to plug in my laptop to get full CPU speed, plus use the included HDMI extender to get better reception, in order to get smooth playback in streaming video sites. You may still experience some lag and/or audio sync issues though, and you won't be able to run the tab casting in high resolution unless you have a very fast connection. Unfortunately my TV is far away from the router so I don't get the best connection. Youtube works excellently. Great price for such a capability.
