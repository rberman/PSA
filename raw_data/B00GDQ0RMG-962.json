The first unit worked until the just after the warranty expired and Amazon was not willing to take it back. I had plead with them to do RMA on it and send me another unit. The second one I got and have had it for right around month and it is already not working. Both the units keep dropping the wireless network signal. The router is less than 15 feet from the firestick.Do yourself a favor and go with the Roku.

This is a big limitation since we had hoped to be able to stream all of our tv on it.  Also, much of the tv or movies that I would like to show my children are for rent instead of included in my membership.

It's much cheaper compared to other devices like the roku or google tv. I have had zero problems with it, no endless buffers or bad video quality. You will be happy that you chose to buy this. I would recommend the Fire tv, but this is like $60 less. It's nice that the device is so small and discrete, less cords and cables. People don't like the device because they say if you lose the remote its just a useless stick...That is so wrong... There is this crazy thing called apps. I downloaded a remote app and it works with zero problems. So yeah, this is a great product and I recommend it to everyone!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "travis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "perfect to watch Netflix Amazon Movies and much more", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "sebastian valerio R"}]
