The device is only 20 ft from a router and all my other electronics have no problem connecting to the internet. Loses several stars for this reason, terrible for trying to watch a couple shows or movies without the hassle of reconnecting the device to the network.Also all the movies available to purchase through Amazon default to purchasing in HD, and it takes a couple of extra steps to purchase the less expensive SD version. (Let's be real Amazon, you make enough money off everyone, there is no need to try and force HD for a couple of dollars more per show.)For now it looks like using the more user friendly PS3 amazon prime app will be the way to go. Especially without needing to reconnect the dang thing all the time to be able to do anything.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anthony Mancuso"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!
