The first problem is compatibility. It will not work with Windows XP so the tower in the living room will not work with it. My Amazon Kindle uses Google's operating system but it will not work any way. I tried to install it on my AT&T; Samsung Galaxy III that uses the Android operating system but could not get it to work. The only place it works is on my Samsung laptop with Windows 7 but only with the Google Chrome browser.Then a message pops up saying that using Chromecast can degrade the video. It is true. Some video sources are OK but if the original is not the best  or if the server can not keep up with the buffering it is worse.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Jerry W.

Another thing that annoyed me was once I got it set up and working the video/audio did not match and I didn't want to change to a lower resolution. After I took the unit out of the TV and tried watching some videos I recorded from dish I wouldn't allow me to. Said something about HDCP.I guess for netflix subscribers it would be ok but a lot of work needs to be done.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dave T"}]
