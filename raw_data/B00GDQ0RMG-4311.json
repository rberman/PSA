The only way it would work was standing directly in front of the TV, then if you pushed a button it would skip about 4 spaces.  Very hard to control.  Couldn't go back or forward normally.  Called, got a replacement remote yesterday.  I can't get it to work, but hopefully my son will be able to get it to work over the weekend.  I really do hope it does work, it looks awesome.. I am afraid the remote needs some work though.  Even getting it open to put the batteries in is a challenge.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cathy Vignali"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "After just a few days, Fire stick is all it was cracked up to be.
