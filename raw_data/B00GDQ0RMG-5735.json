I also found the interface  screen a tad difficult to navigate. Netflix displays  a terrible picture. All the other free tv offers are terrible programing that you will not want to watch. Over all it serves it purpose for amazon tv and movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "jack roche"}]
