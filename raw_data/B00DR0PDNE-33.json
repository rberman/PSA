The HD picture quality is excellent. The problem is controlling the device. I have a iPhone 5, Samsung tablet, laptop and a desktop PC. Out of these four devices the laptop and the PC are the most stable. The iPhone and the tablet occasionally freeze and then you must rebooted to get it to reconnect to the device. This can be very frustrating if you want to stop a movie and can no longer control it. My evaluation of the applications that control this device is there not ready for prime time. I'm sure Google will eventually iron out the problems. Until then I don't plan to buy another one. And yes I do have the latest OS and the latest Chromecast apps are installed on both my iPhone and tablet. My laptop is wireless and my PC is connected to my router by a CAT5 cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James Russell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Esteban"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I highly recommend that everyone purchase a Chromecast.
