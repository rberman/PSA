Unfortunately, the remote control got defect, it can consume up the battery in few hours.  I talk to Amazon Customer support, they are super helpful and they give me two options and I took an option to receive 30% off instead of resend the Unit back because I got the Unit all setup. Overall great experience and value.Only small things that Amazon Fire TV is too new, it does not have a lot of Apps. But I do see more apps coming.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mary Lagrange"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works great - quality of picture and sound surpass my expectations.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "harold Parker"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I enjoy it very much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LaShawna"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A few issues but they were related to our Kindle Fire.
