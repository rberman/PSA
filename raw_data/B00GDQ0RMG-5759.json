I finally discovered yesterday that the software in both the Fire TV Stick and set-top box do not support quotes, forward and back slash characters in the wireless security key, so you end up trying endlessly to type the passkey in only to have the device to fail to connect with no suggestive error message about what the problem is. I was able to work around the issue for the set-top box by plugging directly into the route via a network cable, but the only solution for using the Fire Stick is to change your wireless key to remove any non-supported characters from your passkey. I was surprised this is even an issue given that every other wireless device I use (there are 12 other wireless devices connected in my network including Tivo's, Printers, Smartphones, Kindles, Nook's and multiple computers) and have used didn't have this limitation, hopefully Amazon Developers will go back and fix this bug and include the fix in future builds for the Stick, however I'm not waiting for a fix and will be returning this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "E.
