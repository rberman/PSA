It's not meant for games but the steaming capabilities are unparalleled", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "chris jacobs"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We got this for our master bedroom since we don't watch TV in there much, and the Roku wasn't cutting it anymore. We have the full Fire TV Box in our living room which we love, so we went with the smaller stick in the bedroom, and it's awesome. It's just like having the full box but in a tiny package. The remote is a little smaller then the box version, so that took some getting used to, but it's not a big deal. Overall, it's perfect for bedrooms or areas where you don't watch as often.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Ashley Dirks"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My Great Grandson loved it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "yellow shoe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to set up", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Janekg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Item delivered on time, was as described.
