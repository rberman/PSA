I always heard my friends tout their RoKu and since I had an amazon prime account figured I would give this a shot since it said it had more choices than Roku.  I have been very pleased at the ease of use and choices that are on my fire tv stick.  I really like the fact that I can use it on our outdoor patio or in the living room or anywhere else so easily by just plugging and playing.  The extra $20 bucks I spent to get this was worth it.  all my prime music and movies Netflixs kids stuff like pbs kids and Disney is great to entertain the kids for a while.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dschmidt74"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "wonderful, great never heard of movies, love that it comes loaded with the music  you have purchased", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jennie Torrell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "this product works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jim"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great way to get all the amazon prime video features on our tv..
