I must not have read the description well enough.  Not an easy install if you are running cords through the wall. Now I have a power cord running up to a mounted tv.

One thing it doesn't show here is the power cable you need to attach to it so make sure you have a power source near by.  On top of the regular Netflix and amazon prime setup, there is a series of other media sources but on top of that you have music as well as video games which I didn't see that coming.  Overall its more than I expected.  But its not as good as the amazon fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gift Card \"New Godzilla\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Yes I got it.  It is great.
