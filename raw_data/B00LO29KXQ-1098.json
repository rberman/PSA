I especially enjoy using it to access movies and TV shows that are part of Amazon Prime and thus free.  The stick is fairly easy to use, especially for the basics.  I had to google, then download the full user guide to verify a few things.  I suggest Amazon with include a full User Guide with the package - or, at least, make reference the where one can find it online.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mac Guy"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great!!

I had just about decided to stop it. Then enter Fire TV. . We have watched several movies, but what I am most happy about is being able to watch earlier episodes of TV shows. We are now watching Extant, which we got started in the current year, for example. So now I record but don't watch the current shows, but watch the earlier emisodes, 2 or 3 evenings a week.After a while we will work up to real-time.As for a couple in our seventies, the Fire TV is very useful and I recommend it highly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The remote is so bad, i had to take 2 stars off. It is unusable.  It is twichy and goes from unresponsive to over responsive.  You will spend more time trying to get it to select anything and not go past it, or double select.. its impossible.Yes, there is an app remote for Android and IOS, but that is no excuse.  This remote is more unhelpful, than helpful.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian H."}]
