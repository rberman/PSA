[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Fire TV, don't get me wrong.  BUT, as regards content, my recommendation is this:  If a title is not available on Amazon Prime, always check Netflix first.  If Netflix has it, you won't have to buy or rent it from Amazon.  (I'm sure Amazon is aware of this.)  It would just be nice to have Netflix content accessible by Amazon's Fire TV Voice search as well.  I think we would all feel great about Amazon and Netflix working together. (Remember the Macy's and Gimbels story?) Netflix doesn't have first release content like Amazon does.  But they quite often have it not so long afterwards though.  Like I say, check Netflix first.  It could save you money for other content offered by Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/6", "author": "Donald Howard"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome, awesome, awesome little device. As an owner of both a Roku 3 and this device, I must say that device will help u to cut your cable cord and be free of monthly cable bills as I have done. With the Roku 3, I was a little hesitant about cancelling my cable tv as I would have been missing out on live TV.  With the release of the Fire TV (that has all the capabilities of the Roku 3 and then some) and a little program known as XBMC installed on it, I was able to tell my cable company I was no longer in need of their TV services. Now I watch whatever I want (live or not) whenever I want. AWESOME SAUCE!!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Kendall K. Sands"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "What's not to love?

In addition, I may move it from room to room when they are not using it. Since the children spend a lot of time here, I think this is a great way to monitor what they are watching and for how long.  Usually I will choose content from Amazon and add it to my watch list.  The children know they can feel free to enjoy anything I place there and they ask if they see something they would like to watch otherwise.  The equipment is attractive, very small and so easy to get up and running.  I highly recommend Fire TV, especially if you are a prime member.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "M.
