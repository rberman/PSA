But that doesn't mean that they get everything right. This device is incredibly slow and full of glitches.  Chromecast sprints circles around this device. Doesn't even compare. I thought I \"upgraded\" from it but it's clear that I took about 175 steps back. Right now I have waited over 10 minutes for the device to do what Chromecast used to do in seconds. Until they fix everything this is the biggest scam on the streaming market. As of now Roku sprints circles around this device and that should be embarrassing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cullen Mauritzen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love love love this little thing!

The quality casting from the chromecast to the tv from Amazon wasn't great and I figured these would fix that. Wrong. While they are neat and have great features, I cannot get them to play videos without buffering a million times. I pay a lot of money for the fastest internet my provider has. NO other device has this problem. After two weeks I couldn't stand the constantly loading and buffering. Unhooked it, hooked the chromecast back up and we've had zero issues with videos buffering. The only thing I needed this for that my chromecasts couldn't do for me was play my Amazon videos. Guess I will look into a Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.

First stick simply died, second stick constantly freezes, loses connection when everything else in the home is working fine. The stick does not appear to be a robust product and will be switching to roku which just always works.
