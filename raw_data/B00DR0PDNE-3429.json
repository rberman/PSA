[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "There aren't many things that the Chromecast can do, out of the box, but it does them all VERY well. Netflix and Google Play streaming work incredibly well, and Hulu Plus was just added to the party, as well. I have yet to try that functionality, but I'm sure it will be just as good as the others.For the price, I would definitely recommend one, if you're on the fence about it. If you have 5 other devices which will do Netflix and Hulu, and don't care about Google Play or the sketchy streaming from Chrome feature, it's probably not worth it. I don't have any video game consoles on my main TV, however, and the smartTV interface on my TV sucks, so this was a fantastic option.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "H.Taylor"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Chromecast is a great product if you know what you are getting. We have a Samsung TV (flatscreen, but no smart TV). We used our Blue-Ray player to stream Netflix movies. However, the Blue-Ray player took ages to open the Netflix app and navigating in Netflix was horrible and slow. The Blue-Ray player was connected to the router through ethernet, so it was not a connection problem.The Chromecast solved this for us. We use it mainly to make our TV a little smarter. Mostly, we watch Netflix and every now and then we watch some YouTube videos through it. I also tried the Google Play Music function, which works nicely for me, the same goes for Hulu Plus. The app selection is very limited at the moment. However, it is a product that is very much in its infancy, so I am expecting more apps to become available soon (-ish). I am really hoping that Amazon will make its Prime Instant Movies available through the Chromecast at some point. NHL Gamecenter and HBO Go would also be nice.Setting up the Chromecast was rather easy for me. Make sure you do have a reliable wifi connection, because the phone/tablet and the Chromecast need to communicate over Wifi. Also, the Chromecast will create its own little Wifi hotspot for a short time, so make sure you are rather close to the TV while setting up, so the Chromecast and the phone/tablet can communicate with each other.I hope the Chromecast technology will make its way into more products in the future. I would definitely get a soundbar/music system that would let me stream my music (plus Pandora, Rdio etc.) directly to a set of speakers, kind of like a Sonos, just cheaper and super easy to set up.I would recommend the Chromecast to people who want to upgrade their \"dumb\" TV or to people who purchase most their digital media from the Google Play Store.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/6", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Streaming speed is extremely slow when casting from a laptop browser. The result is that you really can't watch You Tube videos or other TV shows cast from a browser without constant pauses. Maybe this will get better, but if you want to purchase it in order to have an easy way to watch videos from your computer on a TV screen this function is poor quality as of now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kanelld"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It does everything, we were told  it would do.

Also if your on external speakers HDMI you have to shut them off and use internal ones. Right now its an inexpensive toy that doesn't have the same power results of the apps built into your tv .

Free movies, pics, videos, and music. Paired with my mohu leaf ultimate, I get high def, high quality programming without the high monthly bills from cable or satellite. My only complaints:Doesn't support amazon instant video (yet). Hope they do soon.Doesn't play well with HDMI switches. I bought a 3 in HDMI pigtail switch. It works fine with my roku2, games, etc. But it gets no signal when I plug the chromecast into it. Its a known issue though and as my rating says, it doesn't detract from the device enough to matter.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "fenriscub"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Pros:Setup was quick and easyI am a Movie/TV fanatic. I have many other means of streaming (smart TV, Roku), but when I saw this for $35, and the ability to stream from the Ipad to the TV without having to hook up the Ipad (yes I have the apple accessory) I jumped. There are also a number of shows that I can only access on the PC.
