A device that can stream YouTube and Netflix and can also be controlled from a smart phone for under $30 is a great deal. Its power is somewhat limited and can be a bit sluggish but for $30 this is not surprising. Also not being able to use it with out a smart phone or tablet is a downside but for most this is a non-issue all in all a decent streaming device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ToastyMcAwesomeness"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy set up and good support from many apps. I use iOS, and I mostly use this for casting Vudu to my dumb TV. I'd rather do this on Apple TV but it's not supported, oh well, boo to Apple and Vudu for that.There is a short delay while it syncs up and I wish there were a physical remote (maybe I should have picked up a Roku for $20), but it's still very convenient.One feature that I really like is Vudu will switch to a lower quality stream if it buffers too many times (because my broadband is slow). This is probably an app function and not a Chromecast thing but it's nice, on PS3 it will just stop playing if the connection is slow and you have to restart and choose a lower speed. I wish it would just adapt on the fly like Netflix and Hulu but again, probably a Vudu issue and not a Chromecast thing.I did die on me twice over the summer but I live in a desert, probably overheated, but it bounced back. Google made a nice and affordable product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Goban"}]
