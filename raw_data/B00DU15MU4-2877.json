I considered the Roku 3 which does get better reviews on some sites, but the tech specs and Amazon's continued work to keep ahead, well this was the obvious choice.  Netflix, Prime, etc. all download very fast.  My only complaint is that the voice search for now is relegated to Amazon apps only.  But, I understand there will be a software upgrade in the future.  It's a minor and not really worry about hassle.  This baby runs fast with 4 processors.  Near DVD Blu Ray vid qualtiy.  If you like movies and games...get one!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "D.

Power cycle just restarts the video and if you do a factory reset you have to watch it all over again.It already had all my Prime account info loaded so it connected directly with Amazon which made it nice to see the prime movies without having to register the box or do a setup.I like the prime display that shows in the upper left hand corner what is on Prime and what is not. It makes it easy to see what I get with my service for free unlike my other player I have to look into each movie to see what is Prime.One major problem is that it appears that the Fire TV will not work with a sound bar. This is a big let down since 3 of my TV's have sound bars and this box will not work with any of them. I called support and their resolution was to plug it directly into my TV which did work but it didn't solve the problem.I was able to get it working with my sound bar by using the optical cable connection from the Fire TV to my sound bar and connecting the HDMI directly to my TV and it works as expected. This poses a problem because it requires me to change the TV input anytime I want to watch the Fire TV.I am now on the fence if I should buy any more of these. If you are okay with using your TV sound or using the optical connection to your sound bar and HDMI into your TV then I would recommend this box. If you don't want to go through all that then look at the Roku 3.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/5", "author": "Jason White"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The voice search is a dream to use.

The only way to do this is to unplug the device.  Where's the reboot menu option amazon?Force quiting apps from the system-apps menu will reduce the number of reboots but you're rolling the dice every time the device goes to sleep.It's really hard to tell free prime videos from the paid content, Unless it is trending.  I bought this for that so I am deeply disappointed.All i want is a video player for netflix hulu plex and prime.  My chromecast does all of this except for prime with better control and interface.

Great picture and sound and many choices from other application. Also seem very easy to use and, for a non-tech guy like me it was easy to set up.  Would have been good to include a cable for connection (or at least strongly recommend to buy one from Amazon when purchasing Fire)--I had to go to store to buy one and a 3 foot cable cost me $25-----lost revenues to Amazon and inconvenient for me.  I lost a day of usage.  But, overall, an excellent product!,", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "VICTOR K HAUSMANINGER"}]
