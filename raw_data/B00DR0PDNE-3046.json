Not so great if you're casting tabs from a computer. Playing video on an unsupported site means having the video in full screen, great now I can't multitask! It's also a little finicky, sometimes it just randomly stops casting without explanation. Overall it's still a great buy just for YouTube and Netflix streaming.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt A"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I liked this product because it is so amazing!

It stays plugged in and basically on 24 hours a day and I can always connect and stream to it right away. Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube work great but the lack of additional programming integration such as HBO Go, Amazon Prime, and others is the key issue with the device and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me. The only update I have seen since I purchased it was the addition of Hulu Plus which was great but HBO Go and Amazon Prime are key services for me. Hopefully they will make it work soon. Other than that, great device, great software, and really simple to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Eduardo Herrera"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works like a dream.
