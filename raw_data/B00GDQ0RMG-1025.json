I'm pretty mechanical so I plugged it in without directions but nothing happened.  Thought the batteries were in wrong, but not.  Nothing lights up on the remote as if it's dead.  Had to call for support because the instructions are inept.  We finally got things going after a few tries.  There was no 5 digit code to register as the instructions said, etc.  The remote never does light up or have any indication of being alive.  Once you know how things work, it's OK.  We may not keep Amazon Prime for the videos as there is a charge for most everything you want to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Howard L.

DD+ does not get passed from TV to the TV audio out in most cases, and most home theater systems play DD+ on disks but not for HDMI inputs. Even Audio Return Channel over HDMI gets mixed down to stereo. So if all you have is stereo to start with, you don't lose anything, but if you want surround sound you may need more equipment than this stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "David L.

The Fire Stick.  I got this on Prime day and for the most part we have loved it.  If nothing else, we have paid $24 for a \"Crossy Road\" gaming system.  My 6 year old discovered this game on the Fire Stick and loves it.  Using the Fire Stick to stream Amazon Prime Videos has been excellent too.  If this only played Amazon Prime content the layout would be perfect.  But I don't like having to go to my apps just to load Netflix.  And this opens up my whole problem with this system.  The Netflix app.  It's apparently well documented the issues people have with using the Netflix app on the Fire Stick.  We often get moments where the picture freezes, the audio continues with no problem, and then 10-15 seconds later the video goes into fast forward mode to catch up.  My understanding is there is an issue with the cache in the app itself.  But I have not had any issues playing Amazon Prime content, so it's possible it is a problem with the app.  If I enjoyed the Amazon Prime content this wouldn't be much of an issues, but there is literally next to nothing that my family cares about in Amazon Prime's video library.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Joshua A Collins"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fast processor, great to add life to any TV.
