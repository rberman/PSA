[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Arrived early. Very well packaged. Easy to install. Had to temporarily remove power to facilitate its software update after I signed on.I find the remote a little awkward to use, maybe because I'm used to my Roku remote. Surprisingly, it displays at 1080p on my 720p TV. I hope that doesn't cause a problem.Beyond that, the Fire TV Stick works fine, and is very responsive. But my experience using it is limited to watching one older movie \"Lifeboat,\"  since I just received my unit.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marty O'Boyle"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "An ok product.

I've got a apple tv that's much further from the wifi that runs all the same programs seamlessly.
