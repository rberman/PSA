Remote works very well ... Like the User Interface! Great for turning an old non-smart TV into a connected one, saving me boatloads of money until technology evolves again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven Fernandes"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product. Work just like it's supposed to. Sometimes the picture can get bad but I think that's got more to do with the Internet conmection than the actual device. Highly recommended to anyone who wants stream shows on their HD TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christopher C Stein"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great device!!  Very easy to hook up, able to access all my favorite shows.  Very reasonable price!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Meaghan Ellis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I don't usually write reviews, but I thought I should since there are so many options when it comes to streaming. First, it hardly takes up any room and the set up is easy. I do not like a lot of cords around the back of the tv, this simply plugs into the HDMI port and the adapter plugs into the wall. I am pretty tech savvy but I prefer simplicity when I am hooking up things (don't we all!) I immediately started watching Netflix after everything was done. Everything has been a breeze. I've had it for about a month and I love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.
