It works as described, and streams media content from multiple applications.  The downfall is that I have had to reset it multiple times. While this really isn't that big of a deal, it does take a bit of time getting it reconnected back to the internet. I would also love to see Amazon Instant Video  supported in the near future, and with new programs being added all the time, I could see this happening soon.  Overall, it is well worth the $35 price tag", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alicia"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Works well, but very little, and I repeat, VERY LITTLE app support.  Unless you like to watch You Tube all the time or Netflix, not worth the money.  Only a small handful of apps support the Chromecast feature so you can't view photos or face book or most other stuff because they don't support being able to cast the image on the screen.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jim Badders"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "We use this occasionally to Cast Youtube, it can also cast videos outside Youtube when played on our laptop in Chrome.
