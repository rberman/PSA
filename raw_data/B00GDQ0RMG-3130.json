I had originally planned to use it for my secondary device but ended up using it on my primary tv.Pros:1. Much better interface than Amazon app on say Roku or Samsung Smart TV.2. Haven't noticed any lag in streaming.I want to highlight the cons so that Amazon can improve upon it.Cons:1. Wifi range is an issue. I had attached it on my secondary TV which is in basement. My Vizio TV could capture the wifi connection but the FireTV Stick cribbed and said No wifi connection found. That compelled me to move the stick to my primary tv which is much nearer to the router.2. I have noticed bursty traffic/commands with lags flowing from the remote(which comes with the box) to the FireTV stick. I would press a key and nothing happens, I click again and suddenly two actions happen very fast in a burst.3. Sideloading is a great feature, but it is a bummer that there is no easy way to pin my sideloaded app on the main screen. How counter intuitive is that, or perhaps not well thought through feature. If I am taking pain of sideloading an app, it means I want that app and would rather want it on the main screen rather than going deep and pressing 5 buttons to reach to a point where I can LaunchApp.4. There are so many apps which are compatible with my KindleFire HDX but not with the FireTV stick which also makes me sad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CapriCarpe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "As good as the Amazon Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jose Guzman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I can't imagine this little thing being any better unless they could cut the cord on the power.
