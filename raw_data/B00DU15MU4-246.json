[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I've now bought 2 of these (and 3 Fire Sticks so obviously I am a fan of the concept/Separate review will be written but wanted to include that 1 of the 3 Fire Sticks I've purchased has already quit working in June 2015 and they didn't even ship until January of this year 2015 - so 6 months for 39.00).  Although I would have loved to give it five stars, this is why I will only give it three.  The first one I purchased 4/2014 and it made it 13 months until 5/2015, so it is no longer under warranty and of course non-returnable.  .  Great concept, but I am really sad that it only make it one year and one month of probably only weekly use for movie night.  So it cost me basically 6.69 a month to use and I used it approximately 54 times at the most (avg. 1.85 per use).  The controller is very sensitive and if bumped or something is laid on it, it will kick you out of whatever you are watching, etc.  Since I want to play my Amazon Prime on the TV I will buy a third but I sure wish they were made to last longer than the year of the warranty.  This is one item if the extended warranty is available...I would buy it (usually I feel those are a waste of money).  The controller and box were always stored safely, in a temperature controlled room, no liquids were spilled on them, no children/no pet household.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Amazonian in North Texas \"NTAmazonian\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Screw cab and sat, this is the way to go!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Infiltrator7"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Unfortunately I didn't recognize that Amazon Fire TV cannot be used in my place (MEA) only after i receive it.

I wish the option of finding stored shows by voice command worked within Netflix, too, but it DOES work for Amazon Prime. And I can find new free selections there by using the voice command and saying \"Amazon Prime.\" How cool is that? I did have to ask how to shut the unit off.
