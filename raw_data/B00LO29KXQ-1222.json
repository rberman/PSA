I like that you can easily take it from TV to TV without a huge setup process.

Was simple and easy to set up and has worked flawlessly ever since.  Also, have used it in my large smart TV as it must have a weak Wi-Fi antenna and doesn't like connecting frequently.  The Fire TV Stick hooked right up and I used it to stream several movies with no circle of death incidences.  Also, took it on vacation with us and used it at other family members homes where it hooked up and played flawlessly.  Great device for getting and streaming digital services.  It's kind of like taking your home TV with you where ever you go...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "tiv1"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is a great deal and, because it's android, you can load KODI (XBMC) onto it.

Yet another device to plug into an already stuffed power strip. This is barely talked about in the sales literature. Second, if the device has network problems, trying to recover through the Settings does no good; you must unplug the thing and let it reboot. Other than these really annoying things it works really well and has an easy-to-use interface.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John B. Baker"}]
