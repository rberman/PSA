It took me less than 5 minutes to set it up and begin streaming. I added Netflix since a lot of the films I wanted to watch on Prime were either not available or an additional charge. Between Netflix and Amazon, I spent way too much time this week watching movies and rewatching my old favorite TV shows (Jericho marathon! :-) ). It would be perfect if it didn't require an outlet, but overall we're pleased with the Fire Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elizabeth DeRenzo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's great, Easy to use!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angela Darden"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great.
