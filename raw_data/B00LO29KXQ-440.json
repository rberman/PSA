The main appeal to me, the \"Mirroring\" or Casting from the computer to TV, would barely work. I also couldn't watch anything without AmazonPrime or Plex or some other program. I ended up getting another app on the stick and had a friend check out the casting issue. Now I love this thing. I spend a lot of time now in front of the (Fire) TV! Much better hardware and computing power than the Chromecast or Roku from what I ubnderstand. I would recommend again to most.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "El Osito Del Lago"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "If you use Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Video prime, sling and Plex, then this device will be perfect for you. All my entertainment now is via this stick. GUI is smooth and looks great but sometimes you need lots of clicks to reach few settings and sadly advance network settings can only be done during inputting wifi password. To change any advanced network settings you will have to forget the network and reconnect again. I highly recommend this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Razi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "james p."}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I was so excited to get the fire tv stick! Simple, easy to install, connects straight to my amazon prime account, great! It worked like magic.... for a week. One week of greatness. I have YouTube, Netflix,  and hulu plus only on this thing, I have amazing Internet so I know that's not the problem. The solution to all the buffering and freezing? Clear the cache on all installed apps, and restart it. Then repeat every five to ten minutes.
