Unfortunately, you will need either wifi or a mobile hotspot for this to work. That being said.. i tried it out at my sisters house. It worked great! Picture quality exceeded my expectations. I really liked this little gadget but couldn't use it but my sister was very happy to use it for me. I would definitely recommend to anyone who has wifi at home.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jean vong"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "With this 1 Dongle, i don't longer need to connect hdmi to my pc in order to watch youtube or netflix! just awesome!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Moises"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It would be nice if I could cast my browser and actually use it on my TV and it would be nice if I could cast the Google browser from my phone. I can cast any video from my computer to my TV since I can cast the browser itself but from my phone I'm limited to YouTube videos and a limited few other compliant sites. This just means that I have to go into the other room to hit pause, play, rewind...etc. If you have a laptop or a computer in the same room as your TV this is a non-issue.

I don't care about streaming Netflix from my phone to my TV, I already have devices to do that.  Also makes my Sony Bravia refresh every 30 seconds (go blank briefly).  It's a good idea, but like lots of Google ideas, it's still in beta.  For now it sits in a drawer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Matt"}]
