It's literally plug it in, go through a couple of steps and you're set. I've been using it for just over a week so far and it's been working flawlessly. Netflix runs perfect with no problems. Hulu the same. The only strange thing about it is youtube. There's isn't an actual youtube app as such but an app that acts as an interface to the Web version. Hopefully this can be rectified in the future. Also I have plex on Roku and my Nexus 7. I paid... Twice... For it on those devices. On Fire Stick it wants me to pay again for it in this device! This is something that I feel shouldn't need to happen if it's on multiple devices. Pay once yes but on every device? Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap streaming device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Code101"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Turns the TV into a smart TV.
