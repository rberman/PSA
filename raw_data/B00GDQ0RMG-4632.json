You can watch netflix, hulu and Showtime Anytime. At least for some. I have comcast and Showtime Anytime isn't available on this device. I was highly upset over this because that was one of the main reasons I got it. I am a college student and I access a lot of my family's premium channel content via my computer and now this device. When I discovered this, I also recently saw that Chromecast just got access to Showtime anytime. At this time I have two HDMI sticks and I would have to say I like the fire tv stick better if only Showtime Anytime was available I would prefer it over chromecast. To me its all down to operation and I hate having to operate my chromecast through my phone, wish it came with a remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "devanb2012"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love the Fire TV stick!

It constantly forgets the wifi network. Once you try to select your wifi it won't even recginize your password. It constantly saying it it incorrect. Even once you get pass the wifi issues, once your streaming the apps bug out. The Hulu app will continue to play sound but picture will freeze. The YouTube app will glitch for a second and the sound and video will not line up. And the cbs news app will load be fine for a few minutes. Then it will try to buffer and continue to try to buffer for hours. This is a super cheap stick and you get what you pay for. It is super cheap and very very unreliable", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Matthew Dimery"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The fire TV  was given to me as a Xmas present. It is attractive and compact and has a good selection of Apps to choose from. The main problem is I only have 1.5Mbps download speed in my apartment. The Fire TV stick streams only HD video content which requires higher than 1.5Mbps download speed, probably around 5 or 6 Mbps. I can stream 480P content thru Vudu and Amazon prime on my Samsung and Sony Blu ray players with 1.5Mbps download speed without buffering and watchable quality. However with the fire TV stick I had excessive buffering on video downloads, and no options to stream SP or 480P quality. So if you have relatively fast internet it probably works great. Otherwise use a blu ray player, Roku or a smart TV app that allows you multiple streaming options.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rick L"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i like it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sam"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Laggy.
