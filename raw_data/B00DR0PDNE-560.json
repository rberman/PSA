It worked so well, not one problem.  It is not less than 4 months later, it works for about 15 minutes. Than it is constantly loading, and gets stuck on 99%. I have tried different TVs, different internet connections. It was a complete waste of money for me. I only bought it to stream Netflix and I can't even do that. The picture is only a bit clear.
