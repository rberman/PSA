I had another \"stick\" before, but returned it within days of receiving the Fire Stick. Then bought a second Fire Stick for my other TV.The other \"stick\" could only stream using another device in the house. This meant always having my phone in my hand, or running back and forth between my TV and my PC. The Fire Stick does all the streaming for you, and you can add more apps to stream other content or play games. The Fire Stick also comes with a remote which the other \"stick\" does not have.The other \"stick\" would constantly lose connection to my wireless network. The router is only 15 feet from my TV! The Fire Stick has never lost connection. Even the one all the way across the house doesn't lose connection.Anyone loking to buy an inexpensive streaming device for their TV should spend the extra $5 and get the Fire Stick. It is well worth it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Donovan Ridenour"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I'm sure this device works stellar with city Internet.

I really like it since I can install a  lot of the apps from the app store, which you cannot do with the AppleTV. The only gripe I have is that this device stutters from time to time when I am streaming Netflix in HD.
