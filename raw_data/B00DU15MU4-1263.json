[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I am still trying to learn how to use this device to its full potential.  We live in a remote area, so I wanted to try some sort of streaming device and I heard good reviews overall with the Amazon Fire TV, plus we are Prime members.  The kids love the gaming remote and we have been able to use it for our family game nights (Game of Life, etc.).  Would love to be able to figure out how to transfer all apps, games and files from my various Kindles to our TV using Amazon Fire TV, but I am still trying to figure that one out.  Additionally, I don't like that I am able to download apps, like \"PBS Kids\" and others, and then I receive a password that I have to enter on my computer at the PBS site, and then the PBS website says that they do not yet support our cable provider????  We have Time Warner...so I am still confused on that whole process.  I am thinking about purchasing the \"Amazon Fire TV for Dummies\" guide....will try to update my review at that point.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "E.

Works awesome! Already had Amazon Prime and added Hulu for $8 a month. Large amount of content; nearly all the stuff we watched on cable. Now our tv watching is deliberate and not just playing flip channel until something looks good. TONS of choices for the kids.
