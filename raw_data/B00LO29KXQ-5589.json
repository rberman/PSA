Currently we have 2 Apple TV's hooked up to 2 different televisions and a networked HTPC that we use for music, DVR, Skype, etc on the big tv and are pleased with all three of these as well as the OTA antenna for local channels (we cut the cable).  This was ordered to go on the small gaming tv in the kid cave.  But so far it has failed to impress and will most likely be returned for a refund in the morning.PROS:Sexy packagingLoaded with Apps with the ability to download more (unlike the Apple TV)Cloud StorageCONS:Kept dropping my home network while only feet away from the WAP (our router is so hot we can pick up a usable signal 1/4 away)S - L - O - WTerrible picture and sound qualityDid I mention S  -  L  -  O  -  W  ?  ?  ?Spent the extra dough and get something that works (I like Apple TV) and have also tried Roku with good results.

It didn't find my network, and further more, the menu wouldn't even show up. All I had was a blank screen, and when I tried to use the remote, I heard it clicking as if it was working, but nothing still would not show up on the screen.
