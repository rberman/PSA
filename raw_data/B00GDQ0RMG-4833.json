That is for sure. And the RF remote is amazing. I love the play/pause button for web content. 5 stars for being a great way to watch youtube, which I do quite a bit.However, I'm used to watching CBS shows on cbs.com. I can't find a CBS app that works, and if I try to watch CBS shows through amazon video they want me to pay. I'm not inherently against paying, but these shows are free on cbs.com. Ergo, I find myself preferring the old laptop and mouse setup over Fire TV stick... the very thing I was hoping it would replace. 1 star for having no browser and charging for free content. Also, I plugged the fire TV stick into the venerated power supply that came with it and it still whined to me about wanting more power. It works great, it's just whiny.Averaging 1 star and 5 stars = 3 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.

The one thing that seems to be difficult is trying to cast things from your phone or tablet or laptop to the Amazon fire stick. It seems that there are barriers to let's say cast HBO GO to Amazon fire stick. I don't believe amazon has an HBO Go app so it seems they're trying to eliminate you being able to view HBO Go via another device by casting which chromecast does very well. Other than that there are many apps to download and use and it rivals Netflix if you have Amazon Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt L."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gazi Mahmud"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Only thing it is missing is support for directv so that you can log in and watch their online content", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brandon"}]
