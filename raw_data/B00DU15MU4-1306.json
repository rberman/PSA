The games are great, the picture is clear and the voice recognition is awesome.  I don't have cable and can't think of a reason why I ever would.  The Amazon Fire fits all of my TV needs and has some cute games as well.  I will keep the game system though.  ;)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jennifer \"Jennifer\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I don't get many of the offerings ever if I have a 30  days free.
