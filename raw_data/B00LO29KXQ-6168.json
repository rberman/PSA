[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I just hooked mine up and maybe it's too soon to say but I LOVE IT!I already had a Prime subscription and was able to buy my Fire Stick for the awesome price of $19.99 so i figured if it didn't work it was ok but since it works that was an amazing deal!I can stream the free Prime shows & movies on my tv rather than sit in front of my computer or watch on my Kindle Fire so that's a big plus. I also can access a vast amount of free kid shows including Sesame Street so that alone makes it invaluable as a mom.Can't wait to watch all of the seasons of the Good Wife!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Crystal Moreno"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Longtime prime member and owner of 3 Roku boxes (one per tv) and a Chromecast.  Given my family's penchant for streaming video, testing out the Fire TV Stick at the $20 pricepoint seemed like a no-lose proposition.  Unfortunately, Amazon missed the mark with the Fire TV Stick and it will be returned for a Roku Stick (another tv in the house = another streaming box needed).DON'T BLAME THE STICK, BLAME THE PLATFORM: It is not that the Fire TV Stick fails, it is that Roku does everything Fire TV does but does it BETTER.  Fire TV really pushes Amazon content over all other content (Netflix, Hulu+, etc.).  That is unfortunate because, at this point, Amazon Prime Video is not the first place many people go for streaming video content.  I use Amazon Prime Video and have season long paid subscriptions to certain shows (i.e., Walking Dead) but 9 times out of 10 when I fire up the tv I go to Netflix or Hulu+ first.  These apps are buried in the Fire TV interface and require a heck of a lot of button clicking just to get to the content.It seems as if Amazon is trying to make people forget about the other apps out there and steer users to Amazon Video above all else.  Hey, it's Amazon's platform and they can do what they want, right?  Sure, but I'm not interested in using a device that makes it somewhat of a pain to get to the apps and shows that I watch the most.The fact is that Roku does everything (sans gaming) that the Fire TV does but DOES IT BETTER THAN FIRE TV. Roku has easy access to all of my most used apps and doesn't play hide the ball when it comes to content.  Some people have remarked that the Fire TV Stick is faster than Roku.  I guess it is a little quicker but Roku boxes aren't slow by any means.  I have two older Roku models, the HD and LT, and both are plenty competent.And what about Chromecast, you say?  Well, I wanted to like the Chromecast, I really did, but my family just doesn't use it.  The lack of a physical remote is a much bigger deal than Google anticipated and requiring the use of a smartphone to get basic use out of apps like Netflix or Hulu+ is just not smart.  In fact, I had a choice to make when it came to testing out the Fire TV Stick: Do I unplug my Roku or my Chromecast to test Fire TV?  Chromecast, hands down.  Even though I do not see myself using the Fire TV Stick, I will likely keep the Chromecast unplugged since it has gotten zero use in months.SEARCHING FOR CONTENT: This is where Fire TV completely drops the ball.  Search only allows you to search through Amazon's own video content.  Frankly, that is terrible.  If I am searching for a show/movie, I want to search ALL of the major apps for the show/movie!!  Roku's search is much more robust and useful, searching across a number of apps and showing whether the show/movie streams for free or if there is a rental/purchase fee.  Poor form by Amazon to search only its own video selection.  Most consumers who purchase a Fire TV device are savvy enough to know that there are other options beyond Amazon's video library.  Amazon's search limitations left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.WHAT ABOUT THE ACTUAL STICK? As for the actual Fire TV Stick device, it is a fine piece of equipment.  The stick will hide behind the tv of most users so once you plug it in, you'll never see it again - which is good if you want to keep your home theater set up clean.  It's just a black stick, nothing to see here.  As for the remote control, it is basic and feels cheap.  Very light.  No shortcut buttons and no 10 second back up button during video playback like the Roku remotes have.  I have found the 10 second back up button extremely useful over the years.  The matte finish is nice for keeping fingerprints to a minimum.As discussed above, the Fire TV Stick is plenty quick in scrolling through menus but I have not found that to be an advantage over the Roku.  Roku scrolls through menus plenty fast as well, so any advantage is minimal.CONCLUSION: The Fire TV Stick is not a terrible thing, it's just that Roku does everything (again, except gaming) BETTER THAN FIRE TV DOES IT.  Pushing Amazon content above all else and a terrible search feature doom the Fire TV interface from the get go.  The Stick itself works well, although the remote control does have a cheap feel to it.  If you watch a ton of Amazon Video content and plan on continuing to do so, the Fire TV Stick is fine.  If you like to use a number of video streaming apps such as Netflix, Hulu+, HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, Crackle, Youtube, etc., as well as Amazon Video, then do yourself a favor and check out Roku.BOTTOMLINE: The Fire TV Stick is an ok streaking option but surely not the best out there.  Fire TV is just not ready for primetime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "11/17", "author": "LawStudent"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "No need for another spec review. I've had a chromecast since they came out so that's my point of comparison-Amazon \"recommends\" you use the actual plug to power the stick, which is far less convenient than using a usb port on the back of the TV (like you can do with the chromecast). We tend to move the chromecast from room to room sometimes and this will make that a far bigger pain.-The second time I used it I got HDCP issues (blue screen with error message) when I tried to play content. I think it was just a connector issue. It resolved after unplugging and plugging it in a couple times and cycling TV on/off. I havent had this problem with any other HDMI connected device, ever.-With the chromecast, you get the sense that it is only a medium for whatever content you're telling it to play from your phone/tablet. With the stick, it certainly feels more like an individual device with it's content menu and provided remote. This will make it slightly easier to manage content as a parent coming and going. With the chromecast, it's a bit of an awkward handoff trying to control the device from your phone if it was started by a different phone. (Trying to pause something!!)-(So far) The companion phone app feels pretty useless except for text entry and voice search, though I haven't tried the latter and don't really plan to.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/6", "author": "HM"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Less than ten meters from the access point, running off a 10w wall wart, network still keeps dropping.

It frees up my other device so my goddaughter can watch her cartoons while someone else uses that Kindle.  I like the apps that are available and the interface is pretty straightforward.  I like how I can set the screen saver to randomly cycle through my cloud photos.  Pictures look nice on there and navigation of my cloud photo albums is pretty easy.  I like that I can listen to music while navigating menus and browsing my pictures.
