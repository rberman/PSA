I like the voice activated feature.  I love the fact that I can get Watch ESPN on this device.  I watched the NCAA Regional Tournament on ESPN3 and the picture on my HD TV was fantastic.  The only complaint I have is that when trying to select a move on Netflix, the movie descriptions are tiny.  I'm an old guy and I have to get out of my easy chair and walk to the TV in order to read them.  This is a disadvantage over my ROKU device but easily correctible.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gary W. Johnson"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Need some work still.  Not up to par with the Roku's yet, but it is all on the software side, not hardware.  I need to power cycle mine weekly as it stops responding.

Only complaint, to get the free Amazon Prime moves, you need to clink \"more ways to view\", there are three other pay for view options - only after clicking \"more ways to view\" does one get to amazon prime.  Perhaps I missed the part of the video to get directly to AP but it should be as easy as getting the pay per view option.  So far my son's (8 and 10) have been able to navigate that but I can foresee the day that their Dad (me) and their Mom forget to take this extra step......", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gregory L.
