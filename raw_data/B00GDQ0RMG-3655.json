The FireTV stick, on th other hand, is the FireTV's slow-witted brother after the horse kicked it in the head.  It's slow, jerky and mine were plagued with wireless disconnect issues.  (Tested 2 different sticks, 2.4 and 5 GHz with 4 different APs from 4 different manufacturers and various settings with AP is less than 10 ft away through drywall with wood studs.  A Roku 3 in the same spot is flawless.).Combine all that with the cheap remote (without voice search) and this isn't worth the savings over the full FireTV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Better than my Roku box.
