The user interface could use some refinement. Unfortunately the device will not maintain an internet connection. Perhaps I just received a defective unit.

No skipping or buffering - fast response time. Now to program our smartphones, although included remote control works well. Have to give credit to Edward Jones' book, \"Amazon Fire TV Stick Made Easy\" for helping us with surround sound connection, as well as many other practical hints. We purchased this stick to take advantage of Amazon Prime, and are now watching HBO miniseries for the first time.

I received my Amazon Stick before scheduled date.  I ordered three, one for me and one for each of my daughters. The 14 year old is enjoying the games; the 18 year old is disappointed about the movie selection as most of the pictures she wants to see, are for a fee. I also have Amazon prime for is to watch TV shows and movies. I have a Roku box and wanted to compare the differences. The Amazon stick have fewer apps than the Roku. The Roku have over 200 apps and the Amazon Stick have 81 apps. The set up for the Amazon is easy and takes only min before you're watch movies. The picture quality is excellent and no buffering or hesitation that you will sometimes get with the Roku. I really would like to see more apps, and add new movies weekly. Over all I like the stick so I'm keeping it. But I can't put up my Roku box yet.....(crackle) (Hulu) the best thing of all I save $200 dollars monthly.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Keisha Taylor"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Purchased for our sons room!
