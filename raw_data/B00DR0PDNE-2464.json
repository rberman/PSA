Netflix and Youtube are great, but there isn't much more you can stream app wise.We use it mostly to cast tabs from Chrome on our laptop. It worked great for a few months and since then has been continually losing the signal. We can't make it through a one hour episode of a show without having it crash at least 3 times. For a couple of months now the support page has said it's a known issue and that they're working on it...Great idea. Disappointing execution.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Vanessa Dahlberg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I never knew how much I would really use this thing til it arrived.

It makes Netflix streaming so easy. I just open my phone (which I admit is at my side at all times) and I get to a movie or show right away.Previously, I had to hook my laptop via HDMI and then to pause the show, get up and walk over the computer. Now, its right at my phone (Samsung 4S).Set-up was easy boda-bing. Even for a low-tech like me.Just in time, too. I was just starting on the old \"24\" tv shows and this makes it a snap. Netflix remembers where I was and we just continue on. Also, having fun streaming Youtube, and Chrome tabs.Product recommended.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "J.
