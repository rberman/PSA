Wasted several hours being bounced from one level of tech to another.  This is a major problem and unlike Amazon's traditional level of service.Will not connect with the Fire TV Android app.  Tried everything they told me to do.  Simply won't connect.  Love the stick but am disappointed re this problem.  Tech support has me going in circles.
