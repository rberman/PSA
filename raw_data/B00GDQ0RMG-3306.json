It is not. I spent the portion of 3 hours on the phone with Amazon, Netflix (which was why I initially purchased it) and Comcast.  Amazon's help desk is outsourced, so there language barrier and the first guy didn't reset anything correctly and told me it was an Netflix issue.  Netflix double checked everything on their end and sent me back to Amazon....This all started this past Friday evening.  Last night (Sunday) was the first time I was able to use it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Debora L Perillo"}]
