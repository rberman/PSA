[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is an amazing little bit of technology for the price. DirectTV had lost the ability to access YouTube, where a lot of the educational programming my kids loved resided. Getting Fire Stick gave me back access to the YouTube channel to which I had subscribed AND opened up access to some really fabulous programming through Amazon Prime (worth the money you should subscribe.) They love Creative Galaxy and I love that they are learning things that will underscore their ability to read, think and create.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is by far the best I have tried! Much better than chromecast. I LOVE the remote option because it gives people the option to use it without having to have access to my phone that has the app!I only wish it had volume control and that you could turn the tv off with the remote. Maybe you can but I havnt figured it out yet. I love that we can turn the tvOn with it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Luvmy4boys"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Control stick is a bit light on useful features, but overall a good purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William Warren"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.
