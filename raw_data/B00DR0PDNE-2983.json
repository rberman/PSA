After an hour of trying to get it to connect, I gave up and decided to return it.

I also use a couple of the newly compatible apps (BeyondPod and Avia) but I really appreciate it for casting tabs from a computer.  Now people should realize that the quality of casting from a pc  is highly dependent on the computer's processing power since it is really mirroring the tabs and has to \"double render\".  I've tried it with three different desktop/laptops and performance is in direct correlation to the power of the processor. It actually works really well with my most recent $200 Acer Chromebook. The double-rendering, of course, does not apply to Chromecast-supported sites such as Youtube, Netflix and HBO Go, as they cast in the same way as apps from your phone--sending just the link to be picked up and rendered by the Chromecast itself.This is why the future is so exciting for this gadget.  Google has already announced plans to support a lot more apps and release the SDK soon in 2014 so that any website can incorporate the technology.  Once that happens, you won't be mirroring videos from the pc, but rather casting them in the efficient, high-performance way.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CAC1031"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Google has a whole list of routers that aren't compatible with the Chromecast, or require a workaround.  I don't know if you can access the list BEFORE you buy. but it's worth a look to see.  I researched Chromecast vs. Apple TV on YouTube before buying this, and saw the two have different advantages.  Chromecast's advantages were price ($35 vs $100) and flexibility -- I have a PC and android as well as Apple products.  Apple had more features and benefits.
