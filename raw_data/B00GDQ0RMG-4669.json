The screen mirroring feature is what I was hoping would work well, but its buggy and doesn't actually support the full Miracast standard. I'm hoping Amazon will fix that soon.

The TV too has a Prime application and it works far better than the Amazon stick. Both the TV and Stick are connected to my home WIFI and the reception and streaming is far better in the TV whereas the Stick very often disconnects from the network and frequently stops for buffering. Both these devices are at the same distance from my WiFi modem and I don\u2019t understand why the Stick cant stream as efficiently as the TV. It is very annoying to see \u2018No Network\u2019 message from the stick.In short, I am very disappointed with the Fire TV Stick's performance and capability.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Arun"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy with the purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Julie"}]
