The issue is not with the WiFi, because my Roku stick& Wii U don't have any issues- but the fire stick just can't seem to stay connected to WiFi.

There are a lot of options with all the games, movies, tv shows, etc.  The negatives are that a lot of the tv shows and movies are Pay Per View so that would quickly bring the $99/year you pay for Amazon Prime up.  We couldn't figure out how to use it on a different tv so I'm not sure that's possible.  Also, there was so much buffering that we cancelled it during our free trial.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tammy Cachat"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "More than expected.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susan Kirby"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Have played 2 movies thru Amazon Prime and both worked ok except when I wanted to fast forward or rewind I got this awful noise thru the sound.
