That means you have to manually input EVERYTHING.  There are some apps that can be \"casted\" but they have to be connected manually the first time around.  The response rate is also slow (albeit better than apps on Smart TV).  After using both the fire stick and the Chromecast, I'd recommend the latter.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tra Vu"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A must have for anyone who is a prime member.

Unfortunately, this has even more problems than my Roku.  I plan on trying it on a tv that's closer to the router to see if that helps.  Its not as easy to navigate either unless you're primarily using Amazon to stream with.  Netflix, Hulu and others are not as easily accessible as Amazon options.  The Roku set up is easy enough for my 2 year old to use so that is why I didn't want to switch which tv I use it on.  I don't think its a terrible product if its going to be right next to your router and you don't stream with anything but Amazon.UPDATE:  I moved this within 2 ft of my router and it STILL is having a load of issues.  The screen freezes but the audio will still play.  It takes forever for a video to load, and will randomly just go to a black screen in the middle of playing.  I am so disappointed with this purchase...which is a shame since I was so excited about it when I ordered it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lethatsme"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great !!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bruno"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent little stick.
