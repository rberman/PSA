The extender  isn't long enough to work, should be at least 6 ft to improve finding wifi away from an additional device (TV). plenty of nice apps for free and I received a year of prime for 49.00 instead of 99.00 because my hubby is a college student. Works better than expected and has screensavers that are nice as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Diane"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Disappointing considering the other offerings in the same price range. It seems to me that the chief function of this device is to sell additional Amazon products. I find the interface inferior and the remote control app problematic. I would think that I will replace this item within the next 6 months. I would replace it sooner but I do not want to go to the trouble of retuning it. It does function and is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James D.
