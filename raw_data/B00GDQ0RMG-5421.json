It even comes with its own remote. The only thing I find frustrating is the fact that it requires it's own power supply.  Mind you that this is the case with all the other guys too. (IE roku, chromecast, etc)  The remote is very useful, however with a 5 year old at home I find myself using the app more often than not. This is by far the best way to make that dumb TV smart. :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joe Workman"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Would not stay connected to Internet!!

My typical channels are Amazon, Netflix and Pandora. This being an Amazon device, the main menu is geared towards your Amazon content. But it's easy to download the other apps such as Netflix and Pandora. The response time is much faster than the Rokus. Granted the Roku 3 has a fast interface but those versions have poor ratings. I have this device on the backside of a TV and the signal to the remote works great. I also have this on a TV that is on the opposite end and floor of my house from my router. No signal problems. The only downside to the stick, VUDU isn't an option but it can be side-loaded.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin \"Kev\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Useless device, terrible handcontrol .. too sensitive, will not stream netflix. unfixable still. Netflix cant fix it, Amazon tech cant fix it, they gave me a full refund.  my roku units (all three work wonderfully) as well as my apple tv, so it is NOT a streaming problem. it is a Firestick SOFTWARE problem.beware buying this if you enjoy netflix.  its junk.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "donna wieder"}]
