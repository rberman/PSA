Very much in tune with Amazon's shipping core.  The omission of an HDMI cable is annoying, but typical.  For $100, you'd expect this device to be ready to go.  After finally getting all the plastic coating off of everything it's ready to plug in.  The battery cover on the remote is very difficult to remove.  In fact, I almost boxed it up and returned it on the spot.  Very poor design.  I dread having to replace the batteries.  Making matters worse is the slippery design of the remote.  It's very easy to drop, and the fact that the remote os mostly battery cover leabes you with nothing to hold onto whioe removing the cover.  No thought went into the design of the remote, obviously.  Using the remote is worse.  The buttons are way too close to the bottom.  It's loke ho;dong a log by the tip while trying to press a button.  This makes 2-handed usage a must.  The angled bottom angles the wrong way.  Again, poor design.  Compared to my other set-top box remotes, thie buttons on this remote are 1 inch closer to the bottom, and that inch makes the remote almost unusable.The keyboard is alphabetical.  How very...unique.  The whole setup is unnecessarily difficult to navigate.  Everything is where it shouldn't be, and navigation is just...backwards.  Counter-intuitive would be the best description.As for the drab interface, I don't know why there is such a lag.  Just drawing the screen is slow.  Navigation is slow.  Moving through everything is slow.  I would try different batteries in the remote, but don't intend to ever open that up again.  There is a delay between screens that the remote couldn't possibly cause.  I suspect the ad server uses most of the resources.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to disable the ads.  Heck, I can't find a way to control ANYTHING on the home screen.I've come to the conclusion that it isn't MY home screen.  It's merely an ad platform for Amazon.  I habe NO CONTROL of it whatsoever.  It's hard to feel that it's my device.  It's like using someone else's computer.  You know, it has a wallpaper and color scheme you abhor, sounds that set you on edge, the mouse is set up to be used with the other hand and is the wrong size, the mouse movement tequires that you keep picking up the mouse and going to the other side, the double-click on the mouse is way too fast, the buttons on the mouse don't work sometimes, the keyboard is from a telephone, the system obviously has redirect and ad-serving viruses, the avatar has an image is your least favorite person, and you feel as if the hardware was probably slow 10 years and 3 OSs ago--let alone cirrently.  I guess the key word to describe the Fire TV here is VIRUS.After the lengthy and overly complex setup frustration, the device registered on my account--sortof.  Somehow it didn't really sync to Amazon.  I was ready to use it, but had to wait for a lengthy update for this new device to download.  I say download, because, despite the long wait, it only downloaded, without install, as I discovered later.  Lots of things just didn't work.  After a Google search, I discovered that it needed an update.  Great.  Amazon sent me old equipment, without even bothering to update it.  The update took about an hour to install.  Keep in mind that the download was already complete.  I think it rebooted 4 or 5 times in the process.  This sort of exerience really cuts down on the excitement of using the device, but I decided to persevere.  Archaic and sluggish would be the key words here.This is, first and foremost, an advertising device, and it shows.  Starting with the ad banner at the top of the home screen, every single row is a bunch of ads.  Every item on each row is--you guessed it--ANOTHER paid service or app.  As far as I can tell, the \u201dupdate\u201d merely added more ads to the home screen.Apparently, what you see on the home screen is a plethora of ads, pay aps (their store), and a sprinkling of teaser aps that were rejected by all the stores.  Nothing is actually installed except the ad machine--which delivers an overabundance of unwanted content in place of what you want.  Navigation is awkward, at best.  Sometimes, it's unresponsive--but occasional over-responsiveness was perhaps to compensate.  Sometimes while navigating rows of ads, things happen and the row moves around on me.  This is aggravating, as it is irrespective to action on my part.  I can't adequately describe this annoyance, but you may move right to an item, and something gets larger or smaller somewhere, or perhaps something is added somewhere.  Like most everything else with the Fire TV, this behavior is erratic, but it feels as if someone else is remotely controlling the unit you're trying to use.Setup is lengthy.  Seriously, a video?  The training video is indicative of a device that is hard to use, and the Fire TV lives up to this in every respect.  Amazon has apparently placed all their effort in serving ads, locking you into Amazon and preventing you from doing anything you want to do.  I even read that, of you try to run other software, they detect it and physically fry the FireTV.  I couldn't say if this is true or not, but it wouldn't surprise me.  Amazon does not play well with others.Amazon has taken the Android system, bastardized it, removed everything that is good, multiplied the bad more than a thousandfold, and crammed it into the FireTV.Once you're finally to the home screen, it's...intimidating.  Buried in rows upon endless rows may be the app you're searching for.  Should you find it once, Amazon will cleverly move it, so that you have to search again.  This search is a lengthy, frustrating, and unrewarding nightmare.Oh, there is a search button on the remote.  Should you master--or tire of--the overload of endless advertising hiding what you want--or perhaps you are a glutton for punishment--you can try the search button.  This is laughable, actually.  Voice recognition sortof works, but has no bearing on the apparently random search results.  Did I say results?  I meant more ads.  Very infuriating.  Just to be clear, the search is linked to the Amazon ad machine, and provides ads only.  Each result list is solely a random selection of ads from which any useful or desired content has been carefully redacted.  The search does not serve any other purpose.  No results from YouTube or Netflix or any other app are included.Yes, instant video does work.  Some are even included with Prime, but those aren't worth watching.The device does support Miracast, but screen mirroring is clunky, slow, unreliable, and generally of poor quality.  I compared to another set-top box and a Miracast adapter.  Screen mirroring works...sometimes.  When it does work, think lag.  I wish it was my network, but this is the only laggy set-top box.  I got a Windows tablet to work twice in 18 tries, but each try is a lengthy process that keeps timing out on the Fire TV side.  Even after connect, it takes 30 seconds or more for the mirroring to start.  I tried 4 Android devices, between tablets and phones.  I did get one to connect, eventually--once.  I was never able to connect it again, or any of the other Android devices at all.  The Android tablet that connected didn't stay connected very long.  I tested each Android device, and the Windows tablet successfully on the other set-top box.  So, mirroring is out on the Fire TV.When trying to install apps from the store, I was unable to figure this out, actually.  I did manage to look in Amazon's app store on another device, but the selection is limited, the search provides only unrelated results, and there was no way to install them on the Fire TV.I did manage to sideload some aps, but nothing I want.  The Fire TV seems to go out of its way to prevent me from doing anything I want to do.Even renaming the device is difficult.  You have to use the web browser.  Really?  For $100, the Fire TV isn't finished enough, after several YEARS, to handle this on the device?The Fire TV goes to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.  Unfortunately, I can't get it back.  Once it goes to sleep, a power cycle is the only way to get it to show up as an input on my TV.  This renders the device totally useless.  I was able to get back in after a reboot.  What a pain.  What good is content that you can't see?  Surely, disabling sleep mode will fix this.  I went to settings, and behold...nothing.  There is no setting to disable sleep mode--or change it in any way whatsoever.Let's see.  So far, I've spent hours getting the thing set up, trying to reduce the clutter on the home screen, and dealing with all the problems inherent to the device.  The one thing I still haven't been able to do is actually use the device.  Where I was enjoying my other set-top box in minutes, the Fire TV seems to be an unfinished project.The Fire TV cannot use the Play Store, so that's out.  There is apparently no way to fix the home screen.Netflix and YouTube are apparently just cobbled apps.  They are clunky and as unpolished and unrefined as everything else about the Fire TV.  How disappointing.  I'm beginning to think that this is endemic to Amazon.  Their store app, their Kindles, their Fire TV, their app store, their \u201dinstant video\u201d--it's all clearly a third-rate effort.Actually, none of the apps really \u201dfit\u201d.  Despite the search bar showing a microphone, pressing it takes you to Amazon ads.  Even the directional controls have unexpected and undesired results.  Often, the function of the buttons on the remote is not compatible with the app, and produces unexpected and undesired results.  Basically, the random function--or lack thereof--the remote is just another cue to the fact that this is just a cobbled bunch of third-rate apps.So, let's see.  The Fire TV does the following:- fill my screen with ads- have a search that doesn't work- not allow me to customize in any way- not allow me to install apps I want- not provide any content I want- not have reliable screen mirroring- not work with YouTube or Netflix- not function reliably- prevent me from performing the simplest tasks- basically die after 30 minutesWith all these features, I'm left asking myself, what use does this box serve?  Other than overstuff the home screen with ads, what does it do?  The endless rows of ads on the home screen serve as a constant reminder of all the shortcomings and things the Fire TV CANNOT DO.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "end user"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I'm a long time Amazon user - Ive had prime for years and numerous Kindles readers and Fires over the years (currently the HDX).  In fact, I love the Fire so much, I bought this (on sale for $34) as a test to see if I want the $99 one.  And I'm really glad I did.The 2 stars reflects a comparison to Roku and the short version is this:  Roku has nothing to worry about.  The stick does everything Amazon says - the problem is the interface. It is clunky (almost bizarre) to the point that I considered sending it back but decided to hang on to it for backup (the Netflix app on my Roku has been acting up) and portability. But I will definitely not be getting the $99 version.  Trying to navigate this thing is barely a step above trying to navigate the apps on a Smart TV.It does not have a YouTube app. It has a link to the YouTube site - that's all.  That link works just fine (you can sign in) but, again, its too difficult to navigate (trying to navigate YouTube with a TV remote just doesn't work). Roku has the app which allows you to navigate YouTube from your phone or tablet and play a vid on your TV - you cannot do this with Amazon Fire TV - or tablet.If you have Prime and do not have a streamer, this will probably do you just fine.
