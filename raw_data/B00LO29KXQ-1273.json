I have an XBox 360 and an order Blueray and needed some sort of update to take advantage of current apps. The Fire TV stick seemed like the best low cost solution. It is - love the interface, plays all the latest apps, easy installation, etc. - but you need a very fast, strong and consistant wifi. My only available internet is not-so-great cable.  My computer and other devices work okay, although sometimes not great.  When the signal isn't the best Fire TV stick doesn't work at all. If you read all the one star reviews you will see it's the same thing; hanging, video stops, black screen, etc.  When my signal is good it works fine.Of you have strong, reliable wifi I think you'll be very pleased. If not, I suggest waiting for later versions where, hopefully, Amazon will have addressed this weakness and fixed the issue.Bottom line - 5 stars for constant, 1 stars for function.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "H.

Finding movies, etc. could be streamlined. The cast feature for prime instant video would be very well received. Take advantage of the phone's navigation, rather than relying on the device's menus.Streaming Quality 4/5 - Great quality, although I ran into some WiFi compatibility issues when used on the same network as the Roku 3, as well as a few other circumstances where I have had network drops.Music 2/5 - Could benefit from some serious enhancements to navigation. Would be awesome if the Amazon Music app could cast to the FireTV stick and could be used as a remote. Navigating artists alphabetically with the remote is terrible. Playlists are acceptable.Value 5/5 - I got this when it initially went on sale for $10 off. It's been a good product. I have both a Chromecast and Roku as well, and this has features I like and others I don't enjoy.Overall 4/5 - Having a remote with a dedicated pause button is the biggest win this gets over chromecast (besides streaming Prime Video), but otherwise, nothing has really wowed me in comparison.Note: I plug my device into the USB port of my TV, and it works fine. I had more trouble with WiFi connectivity when using the included adapter. I think this is merely coincidence rather than causation, though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jon O"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick that I received from you did not work, the setup did  but we could not see anything but a blue screen and a message telling us that our TV had a HDCP Error meaning that my TV was not HDMI compliant. Long story short is my second call to Amazon Customer Service resulted in talking to an American tech named Zak versus a Philippine tech, who took the time to listen to me.My son found an article describing the problem and the fix, it turns out that this is a common problem and the fix is a HDMI Splitter. Zak found one for me on your site but it wasn't sold or shipped by Amazon resulting in it's taking 10 days to reach me. I finally got it, installed it, and viola, the Fire TV Stick works slicker than snot which is what I told him when he called to see how things were.We especially like the remote, it is so much smoother and faster to scan your offerings than our TV remote. I guess my biggest gripe is I had to fork out another $30 bucks and another 10 days to be able to use my Fire TV StickAfter all is said & done I would definitely recommend it, like I said, Slicker than snot.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paully"}]
