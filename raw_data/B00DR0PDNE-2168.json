We decided to try out the chrome cast.  It's awesome!  I can control the TV on my phone from my chair.  It's wonderful.

Plus the ones that are out there already like netflix do changes to their app often to improve it.My only advice is that don't us the usb power from your tv and just plug it in to the wall.  Tv's like sonys do not power this properly and will give some issue from time to time so go strait to the wall", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "VMonk"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "35$ well spent.. !The so called smart TVs are not so smart...
