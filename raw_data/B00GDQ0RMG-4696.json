SO GLAD I DID.  We have been Roku Streamers for years - cut our cable long ago.  The Amazon Fire Stick has a much better platform than the Amazon Roku app and makes watching Amazon Prime shows much easier.  My only complaint is that the remote is TINY and is easily lost by any children in my room, so I have to hide it from the kids.  Way to go Amazon, I'm impressed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mrs.V"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was so easy to use and love that my TV is now able to watch my Amazon Prime!

Having used Chomecast before I figured the Fire Stick would be easier to operate for her as it eliminates the step of syncing the phone to the tv.  So far so good.  She has figured it out and has had no issues with it.  Great deal for $19. If it goes on sale again I would snatch another one up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tara"}]
