I've been a Prime member since 2005 and have 2 FireTV, this FireStick and Echo now, kindle, etc... This is awesome. I got it for when traveling to pop it in and be able to watch my stuff. It works just like FireTV and so far have been happy with all FireTV products. My only complaint is I wish they would allow you to search everything and not just Amazon stuff with voice.This would be 5 stars if the remote had the voice control like the FireTV and I wish it didn't require to be plugged in. It would be nice to just plug it in and go. Otherwise it's awesome. Got it right at Christmas time and all the family loved it. Made it so easy to get to Netflix and Amazon stuff for the kids. Amazon keeps stepping up and doing some great stuff!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jasonstuff \"jasonstuff\""}]
