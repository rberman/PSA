Netflix runs fine, but my tv already does that. You can't cast web pages to the stick like you can a chromecast (i don't own a chromecast but i've seen it do it.).

This device hooks up straight to an HDMI port and has a micro usb cable for power. I tested on my living room TV with the usb port on the TV for power - it seems to work fine, but the TV this device will be used on doesn't have a usb port, so I'm using the recommend external power plug-in.Pros:-Fast-Great Looking UI-Dual  channel WiFiCons:-Minor Bugs-No IR (for universal remote control)-No EthernetUsing the device for a little time now, I have enjoyed the UI of the the Fire Stick main page and also the UI in the few apps that I have time to use(Amazon Prime, Watch ESPN, PLEX). The Fire Stick also seems extremely faster than other streaming devices that I have used (Roku 3, Apple TV, Chromecast). I had no issues with finding my local wifi, and have not had any issues with dropping connection or any buffering of sorts.The Fire Stick a few times have locked up in a app, but usually hitting the home button on the remote has resolved most issues. Once in the approximately 2 weeks of use, I had to reset the device because it was unresponsive.UPDDATE:(12/8/14) Changing from 4 to 3 stars (I would probably give it 3.5 if I could) After having the Fire Stick a little longer, I still enjoy the speed and the UI, but the crashes in app and have lost wifi connection where it doesn't even find my home network and I have to manual reset the device to make it functional. For the $19 pre-sale price its still a great device with hopefully updates with App crashes. But in the same price range -  I like a Roku Stick over this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "C.Z."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great little streaming stick. I have chrome cast, playstation, and smart tv. It is fun to compare the technologies. The quality of the stream and the ease of setup are great. I just use the usb port on tv to power it and it runs fine(it recommends a wall wart usb socket which it comes with for always on, updates, and caching of video). I like it over the chromecast for the hard remote and the netflix android app kept having issues.Negative on this and the smart tv app is make sure to give it time to connect before opening netflix or you will be prompted to type in username and password again! grr.The battery case to the remote could be easier to remove, right now it's a hair too much.I do not like the android fire tv remote app! they have a weird touchpad that is not intuitive.

Compared to the Roku box, the Fire Stick has a slow moving interface and slow response time. I didn't expect to have to download any of the apps to use, but it was only a minor annoyance. I downloaded Hulu Plus first, which gives rise to my prior statement. As I scrolled through the selections, the response from the remote was slow and it seemed the frame rate dropped to less than 10 frames per second. In addition, using the Fire Stick to input commands felt cumbersome, considering that it is a minimalist remote. Maybe a future update will fix this issue.Also, the home menu seems to be too cluttered and noisy. Compared to Roku (or even the PS4, which is still my primary streaming device), the Fire Stick's menu is all over the place and finding stuff easily is not its strong suit.With regards to the picture, I noticed that the device does not refresh at anything higher than 60Hz and sometimes it even dips from that. I have a Vizio 4K tv which native streaming services output at the higher refresh rate of 120Hz. Hopefully a future update will allow the Fire Stick to output at the higher rate.Overall, the Fire Stick is an okay device which has the potential to be much more. I won't be replacing my current streaming devices with the Fire Stick, but I think I'll give them to my kids as stocking stuffers since I only pay $20 for two. At this point, the Roku is still king of the standalone streaming devices, but if you have a PS4, Xbox One, or other device that streams I would use those over the Fire Stick as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C Bolts"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Pleasantly surprised at how great the product actually worked. I bought one in lieu of purchasing another Fire TV and possibly look for a less expensive alternative to it and a Google Chrome. The main reason I looked at it was its capability to play Plex TV. I was concerned as to whether or not it would be able to handle 1080p streaming from something that was not from the Amazon library. I tested it out on numerous movies and tv shows in different qualities and it was able to handle them better than even my Xbox One. The user interface is the same as the Fire TV, but at a fraction of the cost. It's great if you want to conserve counter space. It functions much like a Chromecast, so you should either have an outlet near your TV but it's even better if you have a USB port on your TV. The other big advantage is that it has built in storage so you can store apps versus casting it from your device. Suffice to say I gave my old Chromecast to my sister. I know this is gonna be a great stocking stuffer this Christmas.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "TechnoNerd"}]
