[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I find it very hard to maneuver through the series listing.  In addition,  when I turn it back on, instead of going to the next series that I should be watching it takes me back to several series that I have already watched.  When the internet freezes, I have to start all over again to search for the program I was watching.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "ladypro"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product!!!! All I needed was wifi, an hdmi port on the tv and a nearby outlet. And the onscreen instructions told me exactly how to connect to wifi. It really was that easy!

There is definitely a lag in the video and audio from the wireless router.The applications on Fire Stick is very limited and need continued development.
