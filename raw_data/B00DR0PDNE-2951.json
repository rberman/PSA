[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Chromecast in its current state is currently lacking in functionality, and it is not a \"one device does all\" solution.  But for what it does, it does a very nice job on your TV at home, and is handy to keep in your gadget bag while you're on the road.It is not ideal for everyone or every application.  Here are a couple of observations in my usage of it.What it is good for--Chromecast can stream any content from a tab in your Chrome browser to the Chromecast, once you've installed the free Google Cast extension.  This means that you can likely stream just about anything in a Chrome tab to your screen, which is especially nice if the site has a \"full screen\" option for their video player--you can get a full screen video on your TV by doing so!  But keep in mind that while you \"project\" video in this manner to your TV, your computer is doing all the processing and must be kept running while the video is playing.  However, if the video player or application is Chromecast-aware, what happens is that your computer, smartphone, tablet, etc. is more like a control device, and the Chromecast does the actual processing and streaming, where you can then turn off your device.  As of a few weeks ago, YouTube, Netflix and Pandora (via their mobile app) were Chromecast-enabled and in my testing, worked well.  A handful of new services are available or about to be made available as well.Not so good?  There are not many applications for it yet, but that is the price us early adopters pay for it.  Also, the device will need to be powered with the included wall wart and micro USB cable if your HDMI connection is not powered, or if your TV does not have a spare USB port to power it with.  The Chromecast also does stick out from whichever input you use, but they wisely include a short HDMI extension so you can angle it off in another direction; this could have been a bit more flexible and a hair longer, methinks.Overall though, this is a great early version of an up and coming streaming product.  It works well in its intended usage, so it is a good addition to your arsenal of video and audio sources.

Roku is half the price, but it's just not a slick as the Apple. Now Google has this Chromecast at half the price of the Roku and it's even slicker and easier to use than the Apple TV.  I don't know how they do it, but Google makes a fantastic product and the price ridiculously low.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark Goodall"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Bottom line up front: most people will be better off buying a\u00a0Roku 3 Streaming Media Player.The big selling point for the Chromecast was the fact that you could stream YouTube content to your television. Roku never had this functionality, instead they would have the user install less-than-reliable \"private\"/third-party channels to get it.  Well, in mid-December 2013, Roku released a new, official YouTube channel that replicates the YouTube-streaming feature of the Chromecast on the Roku 3. YouTube channels for other Roku devices will be released in 2014, although they will not work on Roku models introduced before 2011. Chromecast's \"killer app\" seems to have been killed itself.That being said, the Chromecast is a perfectly adequate device if you manage your expectations a bit. It works with a very limited number of services, although more are being added. You have to control it from another device, like an iPad or Android tablet (and even then, it works with a subset of the various versions out there).The Chromecast is easy to set up and use, and is unobtrusive. It is also considerably cheaper than the Roku 3, and although I don't want to generalize, if you have a device capable of controlling the Chromecast, the price difference probably isn't going to be a deal breaker for you.For me, the Roku 3 is the real winner.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Frank G. \"Once More, With Feeling!\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "$35 to see Netfix and You Tube?

Overall I would say this is a solid piece of tech. The setup could maybe have been a *touch* easier (for iOS it involves connecting to a Wifi network the dongle creates, then connecting the dongle to your protected Wifi network). It was easy enough for myself, but if my parents were to try to hook this baby up, forget about it... it'd never happen without me coming to the rescue.The one thing I did not realize with this device, and how it differs SIGNIFICANTLY from players such as Roku, AppleTV, etc. is that this will / cannot work w/out another device of some kind. Whether it's a tablet, phone, iPod touch, or another PC, you essentially tell the Chromecast to stream \"x\" and it does so without issue. The starting device (say, iPhone) does not have to keep its screen on, and essentially the battery does not drain because the show isn't playing from that device, but natively from the Chromecast. This is good because it saves battery, but is inherently BAD because since it's made by Google, Apple has zero interest in making their things (ie- iTunes music) compatible or playable on the device without significant work. Yes it can be done, but again, that takes extra know-how. I think this is probably my only (and fairly significant) complaint. I didn't want to spend $99 on an AppleTV, however, so this is something that I guess I can live with.All in all the performance is pretty darned good. I have witnessed a bit of waiting while it buffers, and it seems to buffer much more than what my computer does, but at the same time you don't have to have a PC on to make this thing shine. It's very much so worth the $35 and looks great for the streaming. As long as you're aware you have to control this from another (powered) device, and you're OK with this, Go with the Chromecast. It seems to have better functionality than a lot of others (including AppleTV).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Randygk78"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I've had the Chromecast for about a month now, and am overall pleased.  It is fantastic for streaming Netflix, but as many others have pointed out, there is a lot to be desired in streaming websites.  I got the device to watch Netflix and to watch shows online I miss during the week.  Netflix has been flawless, but the internet shows have enough delay between audio and visual to not make it worthwhile to watch on the Chromecast.  Hopefully Google has improvements coming and network apps will support Chromecast soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SEB"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "First time a google product has let me down.  Unless you are willing to buy a brand new, certified google chromecast compatible wifi router and take the time to re set up your entire network, don't get this product.
