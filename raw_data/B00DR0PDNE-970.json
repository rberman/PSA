Bought 4 over the holidays for us and family members. Easy to hook up. Took a little bit to get used to using my phone as the remote but I love that I don't have another remote to fuss with. Even my dad who's in 60's uses this with ease. I highly recommend If you watch Netflix, Hulu etc it's awesome!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ttower"}]
