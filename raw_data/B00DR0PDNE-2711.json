Good buy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Milagros Acevedo"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Overall the Chromecast is a good purchase. I was going to get a roku, but I liked the idea of not having an extra remote and the portability of the Chromecast (ability to move from room to room in the house). Streams well, but works better with some devices than others. For instance, I have a Samsung Chromebook that I thought would be a flawless pairing- not so much. With the Samsung Chromebook particularly the video streaming is slow and commands are significantly delayed. Using and iphone or ipad works great though. Also I don't t like how it needs to be plugged into a power source on top of being plugged into the tv. Gets annoying with sparse outlets. All things considered, you can beat the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Landon M.
