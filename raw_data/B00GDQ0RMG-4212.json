[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great and easily hooked up to my wifi.  The only issue I had was when I tried to  putt the batteries in the remote.  What a pain.  I finally used a knife and was able to pop the cover off and put the batteries in.  Other than that all was good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mjo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really like this.

Lacking in apps but what it has works without any problems. Would be nice if in the near future Vudu or another UltraViolet app would be made available so those of us with with movie collections in the Cloud could access them without having to have another device hooked up as well. Overall it is great. Does what it is supposed to do just needs a few tweaks to put it on the same level as Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Forrest Gladden"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was easy to install, even for a non-techy like me", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karyn"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Buffing is constantly interrupted.

It also plays Netflix, showtime, hulu plus, Pandora,and others. I also have a chromecast but like the fire TV stick better because of the remote for the fire tv. It is nice not to need to use your phone as a remote. You cannot stream content from your computer to the fire tv stick like you can with the chromecast. I now use the fire tv stick almost exclusively.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Samantha M."}]
