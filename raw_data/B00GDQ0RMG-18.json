I have an three Apple TVs for my TVs and use them primarily for Netflix, HBO Now, Hulu, etc. I only bought the Fire Stick since it's only $39 and I already subscribe to Amazon Prime. WELL the Fire Stick is fantastic--very fast, wide selection, with well arranged content, especially for the price. Since it also has Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Now in addition to Amazon Prime, I rarely use Apple TV anymore.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dreamspinner"}]
