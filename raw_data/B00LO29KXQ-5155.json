[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have to say I'm seriously impressed by this little device.  It is about 85% as good as it's larger cousin the Amazon FireTV.  The menus are fast and responsive,  video playback is smooth,  wifi reception is good.  It plays a smaller number of games than the bigger version, but what is available plays smoothly and nicely.The only drawback I've found is that the included remote is far lower in quality than the one included with the larger FireTV.  While it feels okay in your hand, it doesn't have the nice grippy finish of the better remote.  Also, the buttons are kind of mushy and don't have a nice positive feel to them.  Also, a small downside is the need for an external power brick with this.  With it's small form factor we could hope that it would be able to draw enough power directly from the HDMI input,  this appears to not be the case.  I'm sure this is something that an advancement or two in HDMI tech will fix eventually, and I can't really blame Amazon for that.Also, like it's bigger cousin, there is not yet any included support for HBO Go.  Which is a shame because if it was included this or the FireTV could replace my Roku 3.  I'm sure it will come eventually.  The support for Amazon Prime Video, Youtube, Netflix, and a large variety of others is great on this device, and I'm sure will grow as Amazon increases it's developer pool.To put it succinctly:  This is one serious little media streamer that is very worthy of your attention if you're on a budget.  If you can swing the few dollars more,  get the regular FireTV.  The better remote will make a huge difference in the experience.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "justinflood"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far this has been a great device. I simple pulled the AppleTV connector out from my TV. While I'm still becoming acquianted with the navigation, it seem about as easy as the AppleTV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "George \"I read to understand and have the best advisors in the world\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This was one of the WORST experiences of my LIFE!!! This device is NOT compatible with ALL televisions! I spent 3 hours on the phone with (outsourced) tech support with not one but two devices. I told the first rep on the first device my TV type. Rather than checking for compatibility issues she sent a second firestick. Same issues. Audio no visual. Two hours later still no resolution. Finally provided an URL to check device compatibility. NO GO!!!  this should have been disclosed on the sales page. CHECK YOUR TV COMPATIBILITY ***prior*** to ordering this device as no disclosures on the buy page. That's 3 hours of unpleasantness of my life I'll never get back! *****BEFORE***** ordering this device do yourself a favor & find device compatibility. GRRRRRRRRR. They couldn't have cared less. Sad for a site I've had so much respect for previously. I had to give 1 star ONLY because it won't accept a ZERO star rating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Avid Reader"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hernan Cabrera"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Pretty incredible product.

The photos and ads kind of don't show the necessary power cord.  However, as far as the actual services delivered, it is great!  Love the fact that it is already to use with my Amazon Prime membership for all of the extras available.
