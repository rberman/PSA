At the price, its a steal. Suddenly, you can turn any TV into a smart TV. I actually own a Vizio SmartTV, and I still have the chromecast plugged into it. I prefer to use the chromecast when I can because it tends to be a smoother user experience, and has a wider variety of things I can cast to the TV. It is also nice to be able to switch contexts on my phone instead of having to go through the TV to a different baked-in app to watch something.I don't have it hooked up to a device with great speakers, so unfortunately the music casting functionality is lost on me, but I have friends who use it just for that and it works great with their setup.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Michael"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love gets access to a lot of great things enjoying it and easy to set up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "adourose"}]
