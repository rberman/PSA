I then bought the fire tv stick for the kids room and was amazed on how fast this little stick is compared to the apple tv that I moved it to the livingroom. Sorry kids....I'm sorry that I am only comparing it to the apple tv, but that's all that I had besides my son's playstation 3.There is no lag in this little thing, it's fast, and consistently keeps a strong WiFi signal, and the remote is amazing, not better than the fire tv box remote, as this one does not have the voice option.What I love most about the stick is that I keep it plugged in a cabinet on the back of my dvdo edge not behind my tv, and even being stuck in the back of an entertainment cabinet with the cabinet door kept closed, it still maintained a strong WiFi signal and there was no problem controlling the unit with the remote as the remote is bluetooth.Now, how I compared this to the apple tv, I had them both on at the same time and used Netflix at the very same time and put on the same movie which was world war z with Brad pitt.I started the movie at the very same time and the movie started up right away compared to the 10 seconds that it took for the apple tv to start the movie.I then skipped the movie ahead and the movie once again started up right away while the apple tv took forever to start up again.This thing is fast and now my apple tv is catching dust.I was trying to figure out something negative for this review and I found one thing, instead of me using the wall outlet to power this thing I am using the USB connection on my tv which does power this unit, the only problem is that when the tv shuts off so does the stick, which means when the tv comes on the stick is starting up with the tv. Which may not be a problem to most, but if you have an hdmi switcher/line doubler it will automatically turn on the line doubler signal.That's really it, I love this little thing, I am not sure how much more they can improve it is they come out with a second generation model, but I look forward to seeing how they can perfect it.Oh, and one more thing, just in case... for the gamers, the ps4 controller does not work with the fire tv stick, it does however work for the fire tv box. And it works well for the box, much better buy... I am not sure why, but it will not recognize the ps4 controller.Thank you", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Enrique Vargas \"E.

It installed extremely easily in about 3 minutes tops on my HDTV, which is not a Smart TV, and it coordinated with my wifi seamlessly. I've already watched several Amazon Prime movies, some old TV shows, and also have Netflix.  In the month I've had it, I've only had one buffering issue, and that was for just about a second and then it corrected itself.  The remote is really easy to use too.  I'm just sorry I didn't buy this a long time ago, because although my cable services \"boasts\" about 200 channels, frankly, these extra channels are mostly local or regional channels for high school or college sporting events, or programs of that nature. The Fire Stick gives us some more options, and best of all, no commercials.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hawaii 5-0"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The cons: can't use a keyboard on the Amazon Fire \ud83d\udd25 Stick. Otherwise, it works flawlessly. But having to key in on the search bar can be aggravating. I'm sending it back for the actual Amazon Fire \ud83d\udd25 device. Also, depending on where you're using it, you may need a wifi extender so that the stick or the device can receive the signal. As for the programming, it's way more movies and TV shows. To get NFL Now Plus, doesn't work right now. I ended up buying the Nexus Player device and an HDMI expander because I only have 2 HDMI to be able to connect everything I want to include my home theater system. I have a sound bar to include a home theater system. And it definitely makes it dramatically better.
