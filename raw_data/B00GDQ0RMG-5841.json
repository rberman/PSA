It does not mirror the device screen. Everything is just of the Amazon system which is good but not good for customers.The search function for what to watch is not good.  You have to manually move the pointer around which is quite inconvenient.I decided to return and stay with my Roku device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer \"Hien Nguyen\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love it. If they get Acorn TV it will probably replace my Roku and get all 5 stars. It matches or exceeds Roku in most other ways, and I am an Amazon Prime member so they have me.

Otherwise I nominate this for the worlds stupidest device.I entered network and account information - which ALL worked fine.  Then at the very end, after it accepted all that info it launches an  animated stupid and ridiculous video that goes on and on.  What makes it so bad is that they are FORCING you to watch it, describing what I already know and what has already been done.  Home and other buttons cannot escape from it.If the \"back\" button is pressed, guess what - the video starts over from the beginning.Jeff Bezos and the engineers that designed this should be locked in a small room and forced to watch that video on a loop.Seriously this is a bad device.  Looking to sell mine ASAP.Chromecast or Roku are far superior.Update:  After trying to use this for a while, my opinion stands.  This is a terribly designed device. It actively prevents one from seeing information about shows, movies, etc.  There are only 3-5 items displayed on a screen at one time and even then it can only be moved one item at a time - there is no \"page\" forward or backwards.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "JustAnotherTechnoweenie \"abused_commuter\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It keeps freezing (keeps on showing the loading message) when I change from an app to a prime video.

Amazon has put in a lot of thought into it and it shows with movies to music.  I love playing my prime music to a slide show of pictures.One thing it lacks to my Chromcast is with the fire app, you can't cast what is on your phone right to the fire stick.  A drag, but a smaller issue to how well it does what you want.  I don't game, but it is so much better than my Apple tv or Chromcast.The remote it comes with is an rf remote not it like the Apple tv, so it is useful!Can't wait for generation 2.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ski Utah \"review dude\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just got it and works great.
