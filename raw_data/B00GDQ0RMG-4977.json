Super simple to hook up but I am still having trouble scrolling through to see what is available on Netflix, etc.  I think in a little more time though I will have it figured out. At least now I do not have to connect my PC to my TV via HDMI cable. I think they could have given you a little more length in the power cord though. I had to plug into a power strip.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "april showers"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Janet Barnes"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have a Chromecast a couple generations of Rokus and I have to say the amazon stick blows them all out of the water. I use these streaming boxes/sticks mostly for Plex and I'm going to replace my older rokus with the amazon stick after getting one and testing it. The only issue I ran into was during setup, the amazon stick did not want to download the update but after hooking it to the included HDMI extender it worked like a champ(not sure if this was a placebo or if it genuinely helped).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ryan Spindt"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this for $19 back in October. I am in Costa Rica and you will not be able to get some of the apps, but I was able to get the Netflix app which was the main purpose of the purchase, so I do not need to connect my laptop to the HDTV anymore. I was also able to get some good games and other apps. One thing that I would like to mention is that you need a good internet connection for streaming (at least 3 mbps) as this device will try to stream always in HD. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and my family and I are enjoying Netflix more than before.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Daniel Zu\u00f1iga"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV always works better and is more responsive than the Roku's.
