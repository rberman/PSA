The stick does NOT stay connected to a network mine would only work for seconds at a time. I ended up just getting the regular Fire TV which I LOVE and I have had no problems with. After I purchased the Fire stick and it wasn't working well I thought it was just Fire TV still needing to work out the bugs so I purchased the Roku 3 only to discover after hooking it up that it can't be used with a public network in which you sign in through a webpage making it worthless to me because I live in an all inclusive apartment building which has a building WiFi network. So I went back and exchanged for the Fire TV which is great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nicole"}]
