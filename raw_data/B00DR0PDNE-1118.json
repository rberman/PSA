I always had my laptop hooked to the TV bc in the past wireless HD was horrible. Chromecast wouldn't be the best for gaming but awesome for movies or TV shows. So far I have had no problems with video and audio syncing. Chromecast has had no buffering issues with my computer and my wireless, and literally took me 5 minutes to hook up and start a movie on my computer. Theirs no point in getting a smart TV when chromecast made it to easy to stream from any device on the same router.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Nicholas armstrong"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This is the worst streaming device I have ever used.  It worked great for about a week and then it started really messing up.  I usually only stream netflix for my daughter.  Within a 30 minute show, it will stop to buffer at least three times and will sometimes stop working all together.  Sometimes I can get it to work again, other times I cannot.It is incredibly frustrating and it was a complete waste of money.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jessica Rooks"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kinghkp"}]
