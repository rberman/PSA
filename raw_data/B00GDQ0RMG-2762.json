The set up was super easy and I didn't mind having to plug it in (my roku had to be plugged in). The usb cord was long enough and I keep my tv on a tall dresser.  The only reason I am docking a star since the operating system is fast and set up was a breeze is that if you have Comcast and HBO, HBO Go will not work. Wish I would of known this prior to purchase but I can still view on my XBOX One so not a game changer.***update***I have dropped this down to one stars. Hulu plus stopped working as well as the issue with HBO go. I called and they confirmed it is a big issue they have had for a while. The product at this point became nearly useless to me and I returned for a chromecast which I live and all apps work", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jesse R"}]
