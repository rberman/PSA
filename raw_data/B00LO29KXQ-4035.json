But I was very pleased with what I found when I started selecting movies from Amazon Prime. I found I could not only see a complete listing of the cast of characters (most with photos) I could also find other films in which that character had appeared. I also subscribe to Netflix which runs just great with the Fire TV Stick. I had previously used a competitor's product to access both Amazon Prime and Netflix.
