I have phones, tablets, PC's, TV's, blu ray players, gaming systems, etc. that can do what this thing does, but for some reason, I bought it anyway.  I think the most intriguing thing (besides the price) was probably the size of this thing.  I mentioned I have a ton of over things that can do what this does (except chrome browser mirroring) but none can compare to the size.  I have one connected to my TV and anyone walking by would never know it's there (as opposed to, say, my ps3 which you can see and hear when on).I've played youtube videos and movies from netflix on this and I've tried the Chrome mirroring and I haven't run into any issues at all.  I've controlled it from my iPhone, Galaxy Note 8, PC's running Chrome browser (after downloading the extension), and iPads and all work without a hitch.  You can forward, reverse, play, and stop your videos all from any of those devices.By far, the best use I came up with was watching NFL Sunday Ticket using this thing.  I subscribe to NFL Sunday Ticket on DirecTV and I was able to cast games using the Chrome browser.  This allowed me to move one of my DirecTV receivers out of a room that was hardly being used.  That alone prompted a 5 star rating for me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Albert Estacio"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player.This is one cool device.

I just had to update my HBOGo and they've added Chromecast now so I can stream, Netflix, Youtube, and now HBO from my iPhone and iPad to my TV.

BUT, Chromecast requires that you plug it into either a USB port or wall outlet for it to function properly.  This removes one of the most convenient aspects that you are lead to believe in the commercials.  If your TV doesn't have a USB port, or there isn't a nearby wall outlet, then you will not be able to use this product effectively.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "carter"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For $35, this can't be beat. Simple to set up, works with my iPad and Android phone, and has a variety of supported apps (Netflix, HBO Go, YouTube, etc.). It is improving as they add more every week. Other similar systems seem to be at least $50. A Chromecast would make a great Christmas present.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Derek"}]
