Since it was sold on Amazon, I mistakenly thought it would work with the Amazon Kindle.  Soon found out that is not the case  :(  I hope Amazon can get an app that will make it work.

I have watched several Netflix movies on it since without any issues. The documentation however is pretty sad. You need a USB and HDMI port on the TV and you will need a smartphone to load the Chromecast software on. Once an account is created your good to go and multiple phones can operate the device. The Galaxy S4 is nice because I can use the phone as a remote for the TV. All you do is launch NetFlix (and other apps) on the phone, pick your movie and click a little icon that the Chromcast Software adds to the Netflix application and the movie starts. Very easy and the unit is cheap and solid built.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mudbone"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "If I could give them 0 stars I would. First, they only have customer service by email - I would give them zero stars for that alone if I could. Second, the only instructions that come with the box are brief and on the box. It did an update after I plugged it in, but the technician I repeatedly emailed still didn't know what version of software I was running. Thrid, it messed up my computer and I had to reinstall my operating system - not happy about that. Fourth, I could see everything on my TV I was suppose to except the picture and all the technician could say was their engineers were working on the problem.  I have less than a three year old Windows 7 desktop I wanted to use with it and it just would not work right.  The software solutions they sent to me seemed to mess things up more and then they just went dark.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/5", "author": "angsw"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I am usually a huge google fan.

I can start running Netflix from one device, then if I turn it off, I can even use a different device to pause the show.  I bought two since down from $35 to $30 now, and was worried about whether any conflict in use/setup, but it was fine because they have separate setup id#s.  Only issue was that I had to do both setups from my smartphone (Android; LG Revolution) because after the first one got set up, and I went to do the second one with my husband's different smartphone (also Android but newer; HTC One) or our google tablet (Verizon Ellipsis 7), neither of them would see the second Chromecast device during its setup process, whereas my smartphone saw it.  Once the second setup was complete, then his smartphone and the tablet saw the second chromecast device.  p.s. Also bought the \"Unlock the power of your chromecast\" by Aaron Halbert to make sure I get full use of it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jennifer Bernold"}]
