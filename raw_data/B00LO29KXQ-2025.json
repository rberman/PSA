I also love Amazon! However, I find that this stick sometimes has a hard time staying connected to the network. Also, it does not do well when I try to go back to Netflix because it always makes me log back in again (could be a problem with Netflix, but either way my watch time is lessened). I still like it and use it often.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Great little device. I've had it for about a month now. The small device can't handle getting a little warm, because there is no way to turn it off without unplugging it. Once it is hot it gets very laggy and the video has a hard time keeping up. Unplug it, wait a few minutes, plug it back in and it work fine for awhile...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nic Olson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fifteen minutes after the FIRESTICK arrived I was watching some great programs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "emily himelstein"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The fire TV stick works as advertised. It provides a cheaper alternative to steam apps on a TV. I used my Xbox360 to stream video, but lately has stopped working correctly.

After using it daily for several months, I believe even at full price, the Stick is an amazing deal vs the competition. I love the design...the remote...the interface...the ability to play games...plus, it works very well.For $39 the Stick is a truly great product for streaming. Paired with Prime, and you've got a great little entertainment combo.I use it so much that I almost wish I'd bought the beefier Fire TV over the Stick simply because I'm using some side-load apps (Kodi) and games that could benefit from a faster processor, etc. But, for 95% of what I want, the Stick is perfect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bryan Starmer"}]
