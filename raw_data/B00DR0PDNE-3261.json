It will only get better over time. I've noticed that sometimes it slows down playback. At first I thought it was because was using the USB port on my TV set to power it. But it still happens using a normal electric outlet. But even with that been said I still give this product a 5 star. Because I do believe this is software related and with the proper time it will be fixed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hebert Bernardo"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Its ok , but limited to few applications like Youtube etc. Tab view only on google chrome and not full HD :(", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eno Kapo"}]
