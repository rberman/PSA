It's exactly what I hoped it would be and even better. My dad is, to put it nicely, not the most tech savvy person in the world, and he LOVES it and has had absolutely no problems getting the hang of this device. The interface is so sleek and user-friendly, even for an Amazon product, and I was honestly surprised by how nice it was. We use it mainly for watching Netflix but it's super simple to use Amazon Prime and the other applications like Pandora and Hulu as well. The games are a nice touch too but I haven't really spent a lot of time using those because I only got the standard remote, which is a bit of a pain with the games. I'm sure they'd be great with the game controller, though. All in all this was such a great value, so simple to use and set up and it's perfect for streaming, and I even plan on getting a few others for upcoming family birthdays because it beats the hell out of a gift card any day.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rhiannon Gagne"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I like the stick. I bought it because I travel a lot for work and wanted to watch my favorite shows when I am away from home. However you cannot use it at hotels because there is no way to login to the Internet without a browser so it defeats the purpose of mobility unless you use your personal computer which I don't bring because its too heavy to carry two computers.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Happiness is in my grasp"}]
