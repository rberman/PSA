That's one of the features, but this is what I mainly use it for. It's easy to setup and extremely cheap for what it can do.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Spec \"Spector\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I use this to watch Netflix, Youtube and MLB.tv on the living room TV. It doesn't call attention to itself so it's easy to take it for granted, but you wouldn't want to give it up. It's a bargain at $35. Also there's a Chrome extension called Videostream that will let you stream locally stored movies from your computer to the Chromecast, so you can use it as a media center even though it's not marketed as such.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David L.
