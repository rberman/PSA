Nothing but issue after issue. It continuously looses its connection. I reset, I unplug, I do everything under the sun and occasionally something works but more times then not it just crashes again. Then most times when I reset it, it doesn't want to accept my Amazon password. Then when it finally does, it just leads to another issue. Right now it states \"no network connection\". My laptop, my Kindle, my phone, all connected-but not the stick.

Watching Strike Back. The chick playing the LtC has great freckles. Great action adventure. Easy to install. But, you will need at least three HDMI slots. My only concern is heat. It feels hot after an evening of viewing. Not sure what that is about. But, all is well. For the price, it's a well worth it. Great value. Buy it.
