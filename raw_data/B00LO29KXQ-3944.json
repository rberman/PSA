Luckily I've been able to power it off the USB port on my TV so no extra outlet space is needed. Something to keep in mind however if you don't have a USB option and are tight on outlets. It loads slower through menus and searches than the plain Fire TV, but I haven't had any issues with buffering once the program has started playing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jimboslice"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Not a bad product and serves the purpose.
