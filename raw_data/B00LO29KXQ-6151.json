Yes, if I did a side-by-side comparison, I would probably notice that the Fire TV Stick is a little slower, and takes slightly more time to buffer, but for the money, it's one hell of a great device.If you have two TV's, I would probably recommend getting the full Amazon Fire TV for your primary TV, and the Fire TV Stick for your secondary TV. Or, if you travel a lot, the Amazon Fire TV Stick is a great way to get your movies at the hotel.If you have only one TV, it's kind of a tossup. The Fire TV Stick would definitely do the trick, but the one thing I do miss on the Fire TV Stick is the voice search remote, which you can get as an add-on, but after paying for that, you're almost up to the cost of the full Amazon Fire TV. The Amazon Fire TV also allows you to play more games than the Amazon Fire TV Stick. If that's important, go with the Amazon Fire TV.It's probably also worth noting that the voice search remote feels better constructed. Has a little more heft, and feels better in the hand. It's also worth noting that you can get the voice search capabilities using the Fire TV Android app (iOS is supposed to be \"coming soon\")All in all, highly recommend the Amazon Fire TV. It would make a great Christmas gift as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "Joe \"Programmer, Reader, Gamer\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works greAt. Love it.

I was told it was the developers fault because they did not develop the games and apps I purchased for the Fire TV (per customer service guy CC).  I get that, but really? What do I need the Fire Stick TV for then?  I can watch Amazon movies, apps, games, etc on the Kindle or my cell phone.  Why invest in this system?  I must be missing something.  I counted how many games I can get on the Fire Stick TV, 10 under the family heading.  So once again, I must have another device that does exactly the same thing as the 10 other devices that I already pay for.  They can keep their TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/8", "author": "KimG \"Kimberly\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It's pretty simple, after the initial update, the Amazon fire tv stick no longer worked on my tv.
