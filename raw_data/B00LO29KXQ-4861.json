I like them both. The Apple TV however has been very buggy lately, whereas I have not had any issues with the Fire Stick. It is very portable and Amazon ships it to you with your information already on the stick. The only knock is the apps are fairly limited. Remote control is easy to use and responsive. For price/benefit it is one of the best. Can do about everything similar models do but for half the cost. Very happy with the purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Seabass"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got for introductory price of less than twenty bucks.

As it turns out, this reasoning is irrelevant because the Fire TV Stick and a sea shell are virtually identical in their abilities to connect to wifi.Here are five ways that a sea shell outperforms the Fire TV Stick:1) Meets expectations: a sea shell will do everything you expect it to.2) Saves time: you won't waste hours of your time trying to get a sea shell to do something it is incapable of.3) More informed customer service: Amazon customer service CAN tell you why a sea shell can't hold a wifi connection.  However, they do not have information about why a Fire TV Stick can't hold a wifi connection.4) Truly wireless: Because a sea shell doesn't plug into your TV, you can place it anywhere in the room to enjoy the same level of connectivity that the Fire TV Stick offers.5) Less expensive.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "16/18", "author": "Jeff Cropp"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Simple and very easy to use!
