Within 24 hours I bought another Chromecast.I couldn't find many free apps that were of any value. Most of the apps were loaded with advertising and delivered little content.Also my Fire TV Stick keeps crashing due to network problems. Granted I don't have a fantastic wireless connection, but everything else I use can cope with my network.I'm hoping in time the Fire TV Stick experience will improve, but as it is I only use it to stream Amazon Instant Video.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert E.

I can't believe I missed out on streaming for this long. SInce its my first time with this I decided to try out the stick vs the tv. The stick is definetly the right choice for me. I hate using voice controls (awkward talking to an inanimate object) so I do not need this function. Setting up was literally just pluggin in the little stick. I already have youtube and hulu accounts so I just simply logged myself in and started watching tv. The wait time for each load is not particularly long. I have an older computer for watching videos so the load time is just slightly same or less.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bunny"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it, makes using the internet on TV so easy", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rachel Senyitko"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I was very pleased. I found it extremely easy to set up. It's a must for a Prime customer. You can easily watch your Prime shows or listen to your Prime music through your tv.  I found the Fire Stick apps much simpler to use than the apps on my Blueray or tv. The interface is smoother and simpler to navigate.I would have given 5 stars but I feel that the claim that you have all these shows and movies, is a bit misleading since you do have to be a subscriber to most of these companies that the apps represent, in order to watch the tv shows and movies.Please consider changing the wording. Also, the way some tvs are set up, it would be better to have the power cord, connect to the bottom of the stick instead of on the side.Overall, I loved this and would recommend it to my friends and family.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paula H"}]
