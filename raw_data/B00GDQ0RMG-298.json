I had to use my phone as a remote and when I got a call or text it was a hassle to go back and forth to the program and a call. The Fire stick is easy to use has its own remote and works great!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire Stick far exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It only takes minutes to remove it from the box and have it up and running.  I did buy the MINI USB Cable for powering just to eliminate having to use the AC adapter and couldn't be happier.  Once it is connected, there is a short  tutorial that tells you all you need to know.  What pleases me the most is that I can immediately go to my wish list to see what I want to watch..  In the past I always had to access my list through another device.  Watched it last evening and I was amazed at how quickly everything loaded. . So happy I purchased the item..  Great value for the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SANDI M"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "megan186"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's awesome!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tamika Ezell"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It's good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Maximino"}]
