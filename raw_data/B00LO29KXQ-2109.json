We used to have a ROKU, which was freezing and buffering all the time. This product doesn't do that.  Another problem I had with my ROKU was I could NEVER RWD or FF a show, without it freezing, I then had to unplug it and wait for it to reboot. With the Firestick all of those hassles are gone. I can also take it with me on vacations, since now I can hook it up to a hotel's WI-FI.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Maria Sampaio"}]
