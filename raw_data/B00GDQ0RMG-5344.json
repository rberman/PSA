I've been impressed with the usability & responsiveness of the UI.  It's especially good for browsing & watching Amazon content, but even Netflix is quick and the video streams appear to be higher quality than the same streams on my Samsung smart TV.I would say the Chromecast is the best overall streamer at the moment, given the number of integrated apps.  But if you use Amazon video, it makes sense to own both.  I've been using Chromecast for Youtube & HboGO and Fire TV Stick for Amazon & Netflix.
