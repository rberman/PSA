[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Now when someone is looking at their computer and laughing, instead of getting up to gather around the small screen, we cast it on the big screen.  Our family enjoyed this product so much that we bought one for other family members.  They likewise enjoy casting.  Good purchase and used often.We do wish that we could cast everything on our computers onto the tv...i.e. pictures and video from the photo gallery.When we are not using it to cast, we enjoy the beautiful pictures that Chromecast has added.

It's a good and easy way to project certain items on the \"big screen\" but I thought you could do more like pictures for example (I know you can from internet sites) but I thought that you could do pics from other PC's in the home.  No can do.  It's limited to internet based programs/apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lang J.

I own an AppleTV and this does not even come close to it.  I'm sure it may work better with an Android device but if you don't have one it's extremely limited.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gilbert Lopez"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have had Chromecast for less than 6 months.  When I first got it, it was fine - it even would cast Amazon Prime video without turning off Silverlight, then suddenly stopped doing that after a week.  It did a fine job of showing YouTube videos for awhile, until one day it stopped being able to show them in full screen but instead only in tabbed browsing, making them way too small on the TV screen to be enjoyable.  That was maybe a month or two into my owning it. I decided to get a subscription to Netflix and use the Chromecast with it a few months ago, and again, at first that was fine. Then finally it quit working altogether - everything is set up same as before, checked and rechecked, booted and rebooted, but the Chromecast didn't even last 6 months.  Every technical support page says to do the same few things that in searching around I find many, many of us have tried and have just ended up out our money - no fix.  I have never had so many disappointments and failures in a product I've purchased before.  So much potential, but it is completely unreliable not just for me but for many users, apparently, and is not compatible with enough products anyway......think twice before buying this!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "D.

It took a few weeks to get my Chromecast, but the wait was worth it. For 35 dollars this small device is a must have in a any household with an HD TV and Wi-Fi internet. It is very easy to set up. I opened my Chromecast, followed the instructions and within minutes I was streaming on my television. The image quality is superb is you have a good internet connection and good tv. The fact that you can stream from Android phones and tablets, IPads, iPhones, and PC's should be the biggest selling point. I gave these on Christmas and they were a great gift.
