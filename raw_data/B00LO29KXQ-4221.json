[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "It required one help call on my Fire HDX.  I should have know that I would have to turn on Blue Tooth.  After doing that, it worked like a charm.  I purchased it primarily to access Amazon Prime streaming TV.  It works extremely well.  Also tried mirroring my HDX to the TV and that was also seamless.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John W.

We first tried the Chrome one and returned it because it was too complicated and didn't work with my router.  I bought the Fire TV stick, plugged it in and it welcomed me and worked great!  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for this type of service.  I plan to use in in our camper this summer, too.  Thank you for your wonderful product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Granby Grammie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got my fire stick a few days ago.
