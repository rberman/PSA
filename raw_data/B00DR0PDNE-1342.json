I have a old streaming device and I was looking for a replacement.  I got my chromecast and got it started and setup.  It worked great, it was slightly awkward to use the iPad for a control but it worked a lot better then my other device.  A few days later I went to turn it on, and my iPad couldn't find the chromecast.  I used the find new device and that didn't work. I tried to reset the device per google's instructions and it didn't work.
