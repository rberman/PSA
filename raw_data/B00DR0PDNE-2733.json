And even though Netflix is available through the Roku, or various game systems---I don't have any of those, and don't want them. I want fewer ugly, black, power-sucking boxes in my life, not more.So, Chromecast is small, and hidden---and the price is certainly right. Still, I hesitated. I was dubious about Chromecast when I read about it, because I thought I would be streaming from my Android phone, which seemed like it would produce a poor image on my much larger TV screen. What a dope! The phone just facilitates the streaming process. But I'm getting ahead of myself...I ordered my Chromecast, and while I was waiting for it to arrive, downloaded the Chromecast, Netflix and Hulu Plus apps to my Android. When the package arrived, I opened it, tossed the instructions aside, and followed the pictures on the inside of the box cover. It really was as simple as plugging it into empty HDMI and USB ports, turning the TV on, and firing up the app. I was watching something from Netflix in less than five minutes.So, unlike some of the other reviewers, I have had NO issues with load times, quality, or buffering when using the Netflix app. The picture is crisp and clear, and there's no skipping. I'm very happy with Netflix on Chromecast.Hulu Plus is slightly less satisfying. There is some lag when loading, and the delay when loading commercials is even more annoying than usual. I think this is more an annoyance with Hulu than anything.I've also used Chromecast with the YouTube app. The quality varies, but it's pretty great to be able to switch exercise videos over to a large screen.And then, there's being able to cast from the Chrome browser on my computer. Nifty, and useful for watching TV shows on the station web sites. I missed Downton Abbey last night, and was able to watch it today on the TV, instead of my monitor. The quality of the casts from Chrome also vary.All things considered, I feel I've more than received my money's worth from Chromecast. It gives a lot of entertainment bang for very few bucks---and it's completely hidden from view, so no ugly black box to add to the pile.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisa"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "No Complaints about this one.

If the idea of getting a 70\" smart TV to replace your 70\" not smart TV crosses your mind consider this product.  Netflix and youtube stream flawlessly, and you don't lose use of your tablet or computer.  The tablet/computer works as a remote control only, to pause, stop playback, or change what is being viewed on the TV set.  There are many popular movie sites that can be streamed and any web page that you are viewing can also be broadcast to the Chromecast dongle.  It has a built in screen saver mode for times nothing is being streamed, and I must say it contains some very impressive pictures.  Only the Google Chrome browser can be used to \"cast\" from as of the time this is being typed but I would guess other browser companies may develop similar software through open source or research.

My broadband is not the problem, I have Comcast 60MB/s Blast. I also have a DOCSIS 3.0 modem and my wireless router works perfectly fine so it has anything to do with my wifi connections.  I think at the HD resolutions the Chromecast just can't handle the amount of HD data to stream wirelessly?  For example, I'd be watching a YouTube video on my tablet just fine at full 1080 resolution with zero lag, but at the same time on my tv with the Chromecast it is chopping the video up like broccoli.  I guess I'll have to play around with it more with the HDMI extender, but I still wish it could handle HD content better.

Gig Ethernet is order of magnitude faster than even the best AC product in a real life scenario. i am not going to spend time explaining but any electrical engineer should be able to tell you that.2. move all your other wireless device to 5G range if possible.3. start doing tab cast on that Ethernet connected device. note, you need to use WIFI connection to setup the chrom-cast initially, and then it is reachable from all other networks (should you allow the routing). for everyone who does not do advanced networking in your home. this means you can reach chromcast pretty much from your router's 2.4G, 5G or physical port.  make sure both your host computer and router supports Gigabite Ethernet (and gigabite swithcm if you have one in between), and make sure you use a decent N router that provides at least 300 Mbps advertised speed for 2.4G (not combined speed).4. if possible reduce the distance between the chromcast device and your router. this will help BIG times as speed of N could drops to 20% of what it could just over 2 walls.if you did just that, you will be amazed.what if... your host device is like MBA or the so called \"ultra books\" that doesn't have a wired access? or it is not physically possible? well, then you need to make sure you moved yourself to a 5G range and free as much times lot (basally how WIFI works) as possible for your device and chromcast (so you take the 5G freq and chrome uses 2.4G).if you are completely limited to 2.4G freq and have a crappy router (maybe some came with your ISP) and the router is on a different floor as you are, then you could basically forget about doing the mirroring.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Sean Li \"Sean\""}]
