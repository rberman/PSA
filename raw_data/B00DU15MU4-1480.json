However,  I  cannot  seem to stream  from  my other  television.  I am  disappointed about  this. I tried trouble shooting, and have  had no success.Rating of 3 stars because :I would give Amazon Fire 4 or 5 stars however, since I cannot  use it on my other television.I am also  disappointed that I  am charged to use certain  apps. I am unsure why these apps  are offered only to those who subscribe  to them.I  understand that  Roku allows access to these same apps. Perhaps Roku will connect to  my other  television,  and allow me to use the other applications.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cheryl Ellison"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael A.
