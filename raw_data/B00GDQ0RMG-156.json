It's so easy to use and set up. It took me I think not even 10 minutes to set it up and watch something. If I can recommend one thing it would be to buy the power cord that fits in you usb in your tv to get rid of some of the wires cause the plug it comes with isn't the longest but it depends how your TV and everything is set up. I mean what else could you want. You can play games watch Netflix listen to spotify and so much more. I definitely recommend this to anyone", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Casey Pietro"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I couldn't be happier.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel O'Donley"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I have used this 2 times watching a 2 hour movie each time on Netflixs.
