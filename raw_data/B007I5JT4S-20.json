However, I played with it for about 2 hours and realized that I pretty would have to pay for everything I wanted to watch! Perhaps I didn't give the Apple TV a chance, but I was hoping for so much more :( Also, I couldn't figure out how to cast my phone screen and found out I needed an after market app to cast my computer screen onto the TV! I returned my Apple TV the next day.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrew V Marin"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I liked that it was able to download all my music so that I could play it on my t.v. sound system.  But, other than that, I was not impressed at all.  First of all, you can't watch amazon prime on this device.  And the app for streaming, was very poor.  Lots of freezing.Second, it takes FOREVER to get back to the home screen.  You have to press the menu bottom 5 or 6 times just to get to it.Third, and most importantly, we had tons of connection difficulty.  Lots of freezing on all channels:  netflix, hulu, HBO go, etc.  The shows would randomly stop and be \"searching\".  Also, seemed that whenever we used our phones or computers, the freezing got worse.We are very disappointed.  Roku is a million times better.  We have another roku and took a chance on this.
