I gave it five stars because it works great considering the price.  However, I sometimes have to reconnect to the network when I first start using it if it's been sitting awhile, even though Wifi signal is strong and no issues with other devices.  My full sized Fire TV box that I've had for a year is connected via Ethernet cable, and has no issues.  Hopefully this slight quirk can be corrected in firmware soon.  All things considered (including price), I'm quite happy with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SnatcherGeek \"snatchergeek\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really like this.
