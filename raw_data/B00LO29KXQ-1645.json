I gave this a two star rating because of the Best Buy store employee!! I just wanted something that would put my laptop screen onto my television period. The store employee lied and told me that this product did that. I wanted to play Youtube video's and this doesn't do that it just plays prescribed video's (on demand). I went back to thee store and asked for my money back. The employee that helped me with the returned item told me that I should have directed to just a cable not the Fire TV Stick.
