For the price it's the best option, however, the connectivity issues make it disappoint. I've been using a PS3 for my streaming needs and never have a network problem. The Fire stick almost always gives me an error about no internet connection and whenever I check my settings, it says strong signal but \"connected with problems\". It's plugged into the HDMI extender and the power outlet. Unless there's an update sometime soon, I'm not getting any use out of it :( I've gone back to the PS3.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Virginia Shammas"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far, so good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Eric Finkle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received this as a gift and I'm very impressed.
