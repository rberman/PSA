We have no problem with using WiFi with our phones, surface pro... everything else works just fine.  We even tried using our phone as a hotspot.  Nothing!!  We have tried everything that we read and nothing is working.  We did try it at another location first (husband's work) and it did find the network there.  Does it save this information and it is still looking for that same info???
