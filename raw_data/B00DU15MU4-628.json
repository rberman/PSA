I love it.  One little easy to hook up box, one remote, and I was in business within an hour.  The array of movies is huge, the nature, arts, and documentary sections has hundreds of items I would not buy but love to watch. Very happy with this almost unlimited concept. I am speaking to the free Prime offerings, the current pay for items are reasonable as well, and just like DVDs, once you purchase an item, not rent, purchase, it is yours in your cloud for the duration.

But the remote doesn't work half the time. I learned that i have to get a software update for the remote????????? Which i dont understand why a remote needs software in the first place. I update it, and IT STILL DOESN'T WORK. I haven't used my fire tv since i got it in December and i brought it out again only to be reminded of the 100 dollars i wasted on something", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "caiti"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Good but no vudu app, so I can't watch my movies I own....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "veve"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michelle"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "After living with this device for several months I find myself in an unusual situation.  See I want to love the Fire TV, it is by far and away the best device of it's kind compared against the likes of Apple TV, Roku and Chromecast.  But I also have very big issues with this device.  It is something I would love to give 5 stars to and recommend to everyone without a second thought but I simply can't.  Why not?Firstly the single most annoying issue with the Fire TV (and honestly the sole reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5) is that regularly, and I mean almost bi-weekly, something goes amiss and I can't stream ANY Prime content.  When this happened the first time, we called support and were told it was an issue with the device contacting the licensing server (or some such nonsense) and we were walked through a process to restart it.  My problem with this is, this is a device that comes pre-configured with my Prime account on it and yet it somehow regularly forgets I am a Prime member?!  It's a hassle to fix and frankly something that should absolutely not be an issue.My other issue is not really the fault of Amazon, and thus I don't dock stars because if it, but some of the other streaming apps are pretty poor.  In particular the Hulu Plus app is horrid, regularly videos will not play, they might load the ad before the show starts but then nothing plays, other times the show will come back from an ad break and I will be greeted with a radio version of my show as the audio works but for some reason the video disappears.  Nothing fixes these issues either, clearing the cache, force stopping it - nothing.  And it's not with my network or the show as I have no issues from my Xbox One, PC or Galaxy Note 4.Please Amazon, I beg of you, fix the issue with my system.  Make my Fire TV remember I am a Prime member and stop me from jumping through hoops to get it working again, I just want it to work - period.  Do this for me and your wonderful device is easily 5 stars and a hearty recommendation to all my family and friends.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Matt Wirtanen"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "My batteries don't last more than a couple of days!

But to my surprise they have everything but VUDU. That is the main program I use. Sure I can pull my shows off Flixster but I like my Vudu app. Sometimes Flixster has problems with the High Deff stuff.  I have since went back to my Roku because of this so it is sitting on the shelf collecting dust. I will try it again some time later to see if Vudu is actually on there. At this point I feel that I wasted my money because the Roku was doing everything I wanted. Please add the Vudu app so I can change my review and use your product. I also use Netflix and Prime but the navigation is a bit sluggish. I like how Netflix browses on the Roku better is seems more smooth it might be because they use smaller icons. Also your prime browsing on the Roku and this device is not as streamlined.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "C. Dillard"}]
