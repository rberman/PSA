Disappointed as this is the main reason for the purchase. We already could stream from our wifi but in the evenings we would get a lot of buffering and the speed would sometimes almost shut down mainly with netflix. The fire stick is a little better but still have buffering and sometimes frequent on netflix. Also the voice and video get out of sync but this may be because we have the firestick plugged through the blu ray so we can get use our surround sound speakers, not really sure. Will keep tweaking it and see what happens.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Just a sinner saved by grace"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great little gadget!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Renee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect little add-on to the other TVs in the house!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it but some hotels don't all you to change the input source on the TV.
