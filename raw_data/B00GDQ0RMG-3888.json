Barron"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fire TV Stick is perfect. As a previous Roku 2 user, Fire TV Stick is the perfect upgrade. Much faster loading time, mush faster response time to the remote, and so easy to set up when you have an Amazon Prime account. I used to use PS4 to watch Hulu and Netflix, after getting Fire TV Stick, I haven't turn on my PS4 in a week! Also, for a limited time(?), you can get Fire TV Stick for FREE if you sign up with Sling TV for 3 months. That is a really great deal. Side note: Sling TV app is not stable yet, they need to debug, but that doesn't effect how great Fire TV Stick is with other apps. Must get!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Can't Stop Reading"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it and very simple to use!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christina Kornmann"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was super quick and simple to set up.
