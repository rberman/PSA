The worst and almost DEAL BREAKER for some plex users is the \u2018channels\u2019 which simply do not function at all in Amazon Fire TV. The reason is up for debate, no one has a definite answer, and no one has a solution - but every one who uses \u2018channels\u2019 in plex knows that they don\u2019t work - you can go into the channel, e.g. the Daily Show, and in every channel if it has a \u201cfull episodes\u201d link, it\u2019s just missing, all you can do is go to \u2018bonus clips\u2019 and none of them play, so channels is totally non-existant in plex and there\u2019s no explanation or acknowledgement. The weird thing is that it\u2019s also impossible to stream any full-episodes from channels to plex in any way, e.g. the plex extension/bookmarklet for safari/chrome/firefox doesn\u2019t work for anything but youtube and similar sites. so if you go to a website that has full episodes that stream, adding them to your queue and then trying to play them on the FireTV\u2019s plex client just doesn\u2019t work (they either don\u2019t appear or it freezes up the plex app).Movies and TV shows faire far better - there\u2019s a couple of tweaks you might have to do - for example if in a movie you can only hear the \u2018surround\u2019 channels but not hte main dialog (center channel) looking for all the dolby and 5.1 and DTS settings will be futile, what you have to do is go into the plex app\u2019s settings and turn off \u201cdirect play\u201d and \u201cdirect stream\u201d this forces your PLEX server to have to transcode the video, which will then be playable on the firetv (again, no other plex client has this issue, only the firetv) this happened on about 1/3 of my library until i turned that option on.HBO GOI wouldn\u2019t know, I have Comcast, and Comcast decided that they don\u2019t like Amazon, so they don\u2019t allow HBO GO via the FireTv or FireTV Stick (but they do allow it through other players like roku, apple tv etc.) so if you have comcast and want the firetv for HBOGO, don\u2019t, that will likely never happen. both companies basically say \u2018pound sand\u2019.HuluOne of the better behaved clients out there, the hulu app works great on fireTV and it shows up in FireTV\u2019s search results as ways to watch, which helps BIG TIME. Hulu is pretty much the same on other platforms, pause on one platform pick up on another and resume playback, it has all the odd hulu anti-favorites methods of getting to your shows (e.g. \u2018shows you watch\u2019) which is usual now (why do they hate \u2018favorites\u2019?) and the HD quality looks wonderful. Thumbs way up.NetflixIt\u2019s great, also showing up in search results now; netflix runs really well on firetv, and also works cross platform so that you can open up the netflix app on your iPhone/iPad/Android device, find a title, and then chrome-cast style - have it sent to the netflix app in firetv for playback. great HD quality.Amazon Prime VideoThe crown jewel but also the IN YOUR FACE jewel. What\u2019s confusing about prime video on the firetv\u2019s interface is that it\u2019s at the same top level as apps are. so you\u2019re scrolling a list with \u201cYOU TUBE, NETFLIX, Buffy the vampire slayer, TETRIS, star trek the next generation, WALL STREET JOURNAL\u201d it\u2019s weird because i wish i could have the apps separate from my titles. regardless - amazon works with voice search to find titles by actor names and such - it\u2019s pretty sweet, BUT be careful - and always look for the \u2018prime\u2019 banner in the corner of a title or else you\u2019ll be one click away form a $ price tag.Streaming AllCast from iOSIf you have an amazon tablet or phone, I hear it\u2019s very nice. If you have any other device, don\u2019t count on streaming. it\u2019s ridiculously laggy and doesn\u2019t work half the time. especially for HD videos - most just don\u2019t play or play with no audio - photos are fine, screen-casting is pretty much useless because everything it would be cool for (games and video) are so laggy and choppy that it\u2019s infuriating. Just ignore this capability even exists, it shouldn\u2019t be seen as a feature UNLESS you have amazon devices.Interface: CONFUSING. All the top level items on the left are a mixed back of \u2018what?\u2019 and as you move to the right - the icons animate into position and the menu disappears (why?) it\u2019s hard to find what you want, and I WISH there was JUST A GOSH DARN LIST OF APPS! but there aren\u2019t, finding the apps you\u2019ve installed is nearly impossible to see them all in one place. you have to hunt through \u2018recent\u2019 and category lists but it doesn\u2019t show you YOUR apps in the categories, it shows you ALLL apps in the entire store, including ones that cost money. Why can\u2019t I just see my apps? Imagine going onto an iPhone and having to scroll through the entire app store just to find an app you have installed on your phone?!Why can\u2019t they just have a \u2018favorites\u2019 or \u2018my apps\u2019 section so you can sort them how YOU want them? nope, you\u2019re stuck with \u2018recents\u2019 which auto populates with randomness, even from other amazon sites and devices - which is a little disconcerting. Often the app you want - say youtube- gets burried so far you have to scroll right and do \u2018more\u2019 to see it, it shouldn\u2019t be this hard to get to a damn app. why is every other platform dedicated to ease of use when Amazon is dedicated to \u2018BUY THIS\u2019 I should have known. oh well.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Amazon prime isnt\u2019 available on Apple TV, I would have bought an Apple TV. I should have bought a Roku, but I heard the FireTV was \u2018faster\u2019 and it is fast at loading video - but it\u2019s a constant struggle to do simple things sometimes.Also - if you have an older HD TV (more than 3 years old) you might have a blue screen \u201cHDCP\u201d error on your screen when trying to play streaming content - this is part amazon\u2019s fault, part tv manufacturer\u2019s fault, try with or without the little extension cord that comes with the FireTV Stick; and try it on every HDMI port you have, do an update on your TV\u2019s firmware, unplug the TV and the FireTV Stick from power and leave them off for a few minutes and try try try try try again. eventually it will work\u2026 until one day it just decides to NOT work, then you have to do that all over again. It\u2019s very annoying. only have this problem with the fireTV stick - to Amazon\u2019s credit though; they offer a same-day replacement if you chat with tech support (or call). very prompt service.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Joey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Well not much to say...
