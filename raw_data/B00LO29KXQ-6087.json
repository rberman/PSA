This Fire TV Stick has been amazing!  Easy set up and a wonderful picture.  The menu is easy to navigate and I am anxiously awaiting the IOS app to be able to use the voice recognition search features.  I also think the screen saver pictures are so beautiful and look great on an HD 55\" tv!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "spotter84"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Not ready for prime time: it drops connections often and does not compare to the features of other streaming devices such as Roku!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "3/8", "author": "Paper Boy"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "This is just another stick.  The $20 promotional price is the big attraction here. This is a terrific value at this price.  At $39, the stick is nothing special.

Only complaint is that it really prefers to be plugged into the wall all the time, even though it would be more convenient if you could just leave it plugged into the USB port of the TV (you can, it just complains every time you start it up and it doesn't get automatic updates while you aren't watching).Our internet isn't overly quick (only about 7mbp down), and the initial update seemed to take forever but it has ran flawlessly since. Highly recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Red RN"}]
