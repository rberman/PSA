[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I purchased this product for my parents. They seem to really enjoy it. The only thing I can say that is a negative is the layout of the home page.

Compared to the Chromecast, I think this is less user friendly since everything must be done through the TV using the remote (vs being able to stream directly from your phone). I bought the Firestick since I have Amazon Prime and thought it would be a big variety of movies, but honestly the Prime selection is pretty weak. Some of the TV series are nice, but most that is available (without additional cost) are Made-for-Prime movies and TV series. If I could do it again I probably would have just used the Chromecast and not spent the money on the Firestick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jackie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Makes TV much easier and a lot more fun.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "julio cesar"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "streaming movies/ cutting cable bill", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tom McNeill"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Wifi connection is very bad", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Martin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome, easiest to install, get the app to go along with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "luis charria"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works much better than Roku when the signal is not strong!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ebquillen"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy to install, a little clunky to use.  I am replacing cable so it is tough to go from \"Channel Up\"-ing through 100 channels.  The quality is fine.  Good or bad, the Fire TV stick has substantially cut down on my TV time.  I bought Sling TV to get a few cable channels and I hooked up an HDTV antenna to get the local DFW channels.  Saving almost $70 per month makes it all worth it.  Considered adding one of the $5 add-on packages on Sling, but will save that decision for the end of the 3 month free trial.  Sling costs $20 per month and if you pay for three months in advance, the Fire TV stick is free.  I wonder if I would watch more Netflix if it were in channel format - Netflix Classics, Netflix Action, Netflix Cartoons, etc.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeremy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works well, but the picture comes in very pixelated and freezes every now an then due to slow internet connection if anyone else is using the internet at the same time.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Sparks"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great performance out of the box.
