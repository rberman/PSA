However, I don't know how you could get any better than this product! Maybe my favorite entertainment device I've ever owned. I use it for Hulu, spotify connect, Netflix, and the screensaver for a picture collage. It's extremely fast and have only had issues with the software once so far. It's so much easier than trying to mess around with the Xbox or playstation to stream. I don't use the voice button ever so I can't say if it's a nice addition or not.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Josh"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great Christmas present for mom.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William J.
