Spoke with a very nice agent early on with this problem.  It works then doesn't.  Scrolls then sticks.  Can't choose from the menu, it just plays the first selection.  I love the concept, and when it works , it is fantastic.  It just doesn't work consistently or even semi- regularly.  I spent the money for the voice remote, that gave me trouble and now I defaulted to the standard remote and use the system.  Tonite I was able to watch \"Jack Ryan\" because it was the first on the recommendation menu.  It also paused and played paused and played over and over.  It went into reverse 20 times during the viewing.  It paused and stopped dozens of times. I love the Amazon Prime movies and bought this system to take advantage of this benefit.  Maybe I can get a refund, maybe they will give me a system that works. It was delivered early December.  I hadn't used it since the holidays so It is probably beyond warranty.  I will keep everyone posted", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dennis M.

Fire stick loses connection at random or some times does not connect to wifi at all. I had to factory restore it once only for this issue. By the way, my tv has built in wi fi which NEVER loses connection and laptops/iphone/note 4 works just fine in the same area (meaning problem is with the stick and not the wifi). Since its not my major media dongle therefore I can tolerate it otherwise I would have been really frustrated. Honestly, had I paid 40$ for it, I might have had returned it by now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rem"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it. 0 problems.

It's not their problem anyway; it's Amazon's false advertising.I am returning.

I got this at half price even! I have zero complaints and I love the starter video!! Super fast and easy to install. Runs great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephanie"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I think this is great I have Amazon prime and with the screen saver you can use your pics that you uploaded into your amazon cloud drive. Also it is pretty fast. Not as good as the Box but better then the roku 3 I feel. I just wished that when using it for voice search it would cross reference all your apps not just Amazon. Honestly I prefer Nexflix over Amazon prime. If it was not for the unlimited cloud drive storage on pics and music I would not be a prim member. I feel the videos aspect of prime is a waste of money you can get way better selection on Nexflix many times Amazon wanted to charge me for movies or tv shows because they were not on prime but it was free on Nexflix bad on you amazon one star for your prime video. Sorry about the tangent but it needed to be said because this amazon stick and box is designed for prime and the other apps are just there it should open to the apps and you can select Amazon if you choose but it has a crowded interface that really only highlights amazon. It has good on processor speed and memory so until roku gets off their butts it is the best choice.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Oki Dragon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This works amazingly fast!!
