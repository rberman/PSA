Set-up was incredibly simple and this is so easy to operate.  The voice search feature is amazing - no voice training is needed - it finds the series or movie rapidly and is very accurate.  The voice search is only for Amazon Prime,,, wish it included HuluPlus, but that is not Amazon's problem...  The unit itself is extremely compact and transportable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Walter W.
