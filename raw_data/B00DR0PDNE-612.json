Includes 5V USB outlet plug for Older TV w/o USB.Vendor selling 6\" MicroUSB cable for $5 - $6, what a scam!Simple Answer to \"Cast Screen\" which mirrors entire mobile display: WORKS ONLY ON ANDROID.  Not on iOS devices.Only approved iOS apps listed in Chromecast may be casted which you end up juggling over 15+ apps = waste of storage, multiple credential sign-in and locked to watching limited content.Why this?  AppleTV AirPlay constantly disconnects even with full Wi-Fi signal using iPhone/iPad and had to reset almost every time to get it working.
