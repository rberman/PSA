We don't do much more than watch Netflix and listen to music with it but it's nice to just have an easier way to do that. The only problem I have with either device is that remotes are SUPER SUPER sensitive. You just bump them and it can shut off what you're watching...All in all, it's a great system and I love it aside from the ultra touchy remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
