I use to stream Netflix through my Wii game console, and continued to do that for a few weeks until my daughter forced me to hook up the Amazon Fire TV unit. The unit offers so much more to those of us that have given up cable. I have access to lots of free movies, games and cable TV shows ('Justified' is an awesome series and is free to Prime members). Netflix streams wonderfully through Amazon Fire TV. And the movies seem more vivid and clear being streamed this way. I think I have really only scratched the surface as to what the Amazon Fire TV can do, though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"forever39\""}]
