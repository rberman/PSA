I bought it specifically so I could use it to stream videos from my computer browser - I've got a DVD player and a PS3, which takes care of netflix, hulu, youtube, etc. However, as often as not, when I try to use the chrome cast, I get horrible lags that make what I'm trying to watch essentially unwatchable, even when I've set it to standard rather than high. It's fine on my laptop, so that's not the problem. The lagging is incredibly frustrating, and because of it, I really wouldn't recommend chromecast - we have definitely not gotten our money's worth.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jane S"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.
