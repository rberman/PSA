Actually it stops and tells you \"connected but with problems\" and does not tell you what the problem is or how to fix it. Sometimes unplugging it and plugging back in to the power source fixes the problem sometimes it doesn't. The problem is not my wireless, because I can stream movies to the tv using three other devices without these problems.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "14/15", "author": "David Patterson"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far I love the Fire TV stick. It was a quick and simple setup. I quickly began enjoying all the different programs available! The was a XMAS gift and it's just been great!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lydia L Christmas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The fire stick is really nice.  It has higher specs than the Google Chrome-Cast and comes with a remote which is key to people who don't have smartphones or just simply want a separate physical remote.  The price is very good only 4 dollars more than the Chrome-Cast and about 10 dollars less than the Roku stick.  The overall all construction and quality is very good and it performs quite well.  The one thing that I don't really like is that you have to use the power adapter that comes with it instead of just powering it by USB.  But it makes sense considering that you can play games on the Fire TV Stick and games usually require more power.  This is the best streaming stick you can currently buy considering specs and practicality.  Also it can be used by almost anyone (including kids and grandparents).  If you are a Google enthusiast I would recommend sticking with the Chrome-Cast considering that it has it's own unique features like mirroring your Android phone screen and casting from various sources like from your desktop or phone.  Overall, the Fire TV Stick is a great all-in-one media streaming package at a wonderful price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Muhammad \"Muhammad Chamas\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great on my home network.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought it for $19.
