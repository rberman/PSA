[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Well i have many devices from cell phones to Rokus connected to my wireless network.  However the Fire TV stick has to be next to the Wi-Fi router in order for it to work.  Yes I tried the HD extender as well as changing the settings on the router, but nothing works.  I have two Rokus and I love them.  Easy to use interface and never a problem connecting to my Wi-Fi.  Don't waste your money on the Fire TV Stick ... get a Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Tom Murphy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

First movie played about halfway & quit. Called & they had no idea what to do so if all else fails, disconnect power from stick, pull stick out from TV, then reconnect. Stick was very hot. They didn't know why. It reconnected to finish movie. Haven't used it since.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Mary Johnson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Drew Crafton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this item. Simple to connect to TV and was already set up with my account information. Once setup you can take the Fire TV stick from TV to TV with no set up required, just connect and start enjoying your prime. Received for Christmas, I have not tried any of the apps yet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is my first streaming stick and I am satisfied. I have long considered getting an apple TV or a Roku, but jumped on this because of the price and because I am a prime member. I have found the menus easy to navigate with the included remote and the quality of the picture and sound is good. Overall, this is a more enjoyable way to watch amazon prime movies than hooking up my laptop to the TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.

Still learning!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Roger Limoges"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Once again I fell for the marketing hype! Beware, the firestick is a great idea, however, even though the Amazon prime membership is optional, I was under the impression I would have access to 200,000+ movies and tv shows, and you do, but, everything costs!!!! I watched a couple of WWII movies, 55 years old now, they still cost $4.99??? Exactly what does the $104 go for? This is really sad because I use Amazon all the time, and I'm generally very happy with everything I buy. I read the description repeatedly before buying this product, never did it say anywhere there were additional charges, NOWHERE! I'm also new to Netflix, which I also subscribed to, why is it you have to pay twice for that service too? Can someone please tell me how these marketing departments can get away with this?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "mark morgan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing things!
