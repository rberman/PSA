I was surprised that after paying for the stick, then a years subscription to Amazon Prime that I still have to pay a rental fee for movies or even tv shows.  That wasn't mentioned.  Also seems that certain channels offered still are dependent on your cable carrier and some aren't available through Fire....  So its ok, better than the others but I wonder if I would be in the same place if with just my prime subscription and my smart tv....  maybe more will be offered in the coming months via Fire Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thomas L."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this to replace my Google Chromecast and I am very satisfied with the decision. The remote is easy to use, the on-screen interaction is simple and easy to navigate. This stick is also very fast; seems like the movies start almost right away. My only two concerns are the video I am forced to watch after installing each device (I bought two) and the lack of an app to operate the stick on my iPad. Both of these are minor because the app is on the way and I hope to never see the video again. I highly recommend this item; it is a big hit in our house", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MDSasquatch \"MDSasquatch\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "This item is very inconsistent when connecting to my home network.
