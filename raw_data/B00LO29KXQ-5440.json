Unfortunately it kept dropping the wi-fi signal. This may have been due to my having a Smart TV & not the product.

It is easy to use and user friendly, with many features. The only issue I have had is the displaying of \"HDCP unauthorized.\" Which is caused if one were to disconnect the device and replug it into the tv, while it is on. To fix the problem one would need to reconnect the Amazon Fire TV Stick and forget the wifi connection. Re-connect to the wifi connection and it should be working again.Steps in-case you get the display \"HDCP unauthorized.\" after it had been working:step 1: Have TV connected with Amazon Fire TV stickStep 2: Forget wifi accessStep 3: Re-connect to wifiStep 4: check if it worked.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "MD.E"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Let me start with I like it a lot. Like a LOT. However I will say I am coming from a chrome cast and the only way on the Fire TV stick I have been able to cast MY media on the TV (for instance to share a recorded video but same issue for YouTube vidios) is screen mirroring but that is easy to accidentally exit from and some videos are not the desired shape and all. Over all though it is a FANTASTIC little device it is better than the chrome cast in almost every way. I like the home, the apps, the the fact it has a remote, and lots of other things that set it apart. I would 100% recommend it but do be warned of the casting issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Kenneth Laster III"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Less than five minutes from opening the shipping box to watching Netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amy Towery \"Nonna\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I just wish I had fast enough broadband to where I could use it.

Currently, I use my Wii to watch Netflix. I thought this would be better; it's smaller and can access Netflix, plus I'd be able to watch the Prime movies. However, I'm not impressed at all. It requires an extremely high speed internet and if something else in the house is using the wifi, it won't load my videos. It buffers every few minutes. My Wii works a million times better. Luckily, I got this during a sale for only $20. Should have saved my $20.
