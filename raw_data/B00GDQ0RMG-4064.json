I've never been so disappointed in an Amazon product. It will not connect to my WiFi. It tells me it is connected with problems but never identifies the problem. It isn't my WI-FI connection because my Roku box streams uninterrupted, no buffering. My phone will connect. My laptop connects. I have applied updates and followed every suggestion I can find to making this actually usable. Extremely disappointed.
