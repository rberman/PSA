You know, you see the commercials and hope the product will do as advertised. Well this one does exactly what its supposed to do. It was easy to set up but I had to be pacient with it. I did have an issue with the set up and had to research the problem, but I quickly found the solution. For using this to view things that don;t have aps, like watching movies on Amazon Instant video, I have to disable Silverlight and its easy enough to do, but Then I have to turn Silverlight back on to watch things with aps like Netflix. But its no big deal and its great to be able to see on the tv whatever is on my computer screen.
