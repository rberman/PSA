[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this product!  Works vastly better than connecting your Kindle via mirroring (Kindle HDX verison) or mini-HDMI cable (previous Kindle version).  It's easy to install and use and is reasonably priced.  It makes watching multi-sourced (Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, etc) TV and movies much more convenient.  The only downside for me is that it can't be powered by USB.  You need to plug it into an outlet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LilyBook"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I pre-ordered this item when it was first offered back in October. I have had and have used a Roku for several years, but I have to say that Amazon has surpassed Roku with the clean interface of Fire TV. The Fire TV Stick is great, but it just makes me want to buy the full version.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jonathon \"jpopphan\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like the performance of the Stick. I have had Roku player for few years, and it sucks from time to time because of performance issues.Only contentious point I have about the Fire TV Stick is that it doesn't allow you to have all the video apps that's there in Google Play store. And not all those apps are available in Amazon store either. For e.g. Dishworld TV, Browser, etc.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shiva K."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Would be perfect if the identical YouTube.com app on my Kindle HDX tablet and Fire TV stick worked properly.  The mirroring results are unwatchable---constantly jumping. For viewing Amazon Prime content it is great, though entering a PIN every time for viewing Prime videos is a minor nuisance. For YouTube content I will continue using my iPhone / Roku HD combo until Amazon works the bugs out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "T.

Required 3 levels of accounts, passwords, and configurations (wifi network, Amazon, & Netflix).Once set up, it does give nice access to Netflix from any TV in the house. Everything else is simply a way to force you to buy Amazon Prime.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "stuart brown"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE it and easy to use!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William Kelley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing.
