I love the voice search and auto play feature.  The download speed is amazing!  I was questioning if I needed to change internet providers when I was using my Roku 2 because there was so much buffering!  Once I got this product I realized the buffering and slow download times had to do with the Roku and not my internet connection!!!  I am so happy I got this and will be purchasing another one to replace my other Roku!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MELISSA"}]
