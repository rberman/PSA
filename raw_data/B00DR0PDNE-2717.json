[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Price is great.Playing supported apps is great.Want to see something from the web that isn't associated with an app?  You can mirror what is on your screen.....well, only if you use chrome browser.  Oh, and not if you are trying to do it with an iPad or iPhone. Oh, and if you do it from your desktop and your chrome browser; the sound will be out of sync. ( they really need to fix that)However, we have used it everyday to watch netflix and YouTube. Love sonza.Still waiting for someone to make a device that will mirror anything on my iPad and ancient iPhone.Overall it's my bad for not doing more research on its limitations.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "T.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it is limited on the amount of apps that will broadcast to it.

Second of all, it does not support static IPs at all.I've worked in IT and had issues setting this up on other's wifis, can't set it up on my own network, so it is basically useless for me. For most average setups maybe its ok.Like the idea, dislike the product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Centity"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I bought several of these under the impression that it would display photos and videos from my device. I was disappointed to find out that all it does is receive a URL you give it (Youtube, Netflix) from your device, and it proceeds to stream from that source, and furthermore, those sources are restricted by design.For it to be useful as a streaming media device, it needs to stream from my mobile device, not just from specific Internet locations.Also if you have a router or firewall protecting your local LAN and it's set up correctly (meaning it keeps bad guys out), expect there to be problems. The Chromecast uses Google's domain name servers rather than picking up yours from when it gets its IP address from your wireless system. Your firewall may block its access to the unexpected DNS traffic.Come on engineers: produce a useful version. You've got the WiFi bandwith. Make the local App on the device stream local videos or display its screen (for photos) through the Chromecast!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "22/25", "author": "String Theory"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "My girlfriend and I were able to make it to what appeared to be last step in making this work (the \"ready to cast\" prompt appeared on the ipad mini we were using), but that's as far as we got, even after at least an hour of constant effort.
