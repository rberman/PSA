The Fire Stick performs at about 3/5ths the level of the Fire TV.  So it's a decent value, but due to its location behind a flat-screen TV, the Wi-Fi performance is mediocre.  That's obviously not a problem of the unit, but even when it's operating maximally, it's slow compared to the bigger box.

This is not a good thing when you're watching live TV!  Sometimes it will have \"glitches\" as well.  And then there's the Hulu app.  It is really \"hit or miss\" with it.  Some days it plays perfectly, others not so much.  You have to back out completely and start the app back up multiple times to watch a show - the longer the show the worse it is.  It seems to be getting better, but...My biggest complaint is what sometimes seems to be an excessive amount of buffering, even with Netflix.  If they could fix that problem, this would rate even higher than the three stars I've given it.  (I do own two of them, however, one was free for signing up with Sling and the other one I bought).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike H"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Continues to lose connectivity, have playback errors and the wifi connects with a \"very good\" signal strength but then occassionally bumps to \"connected with problems.\"", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lockie"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "We have digital cable on our \"main\" television in the living room - with movie channels and sports. Our bedroom TV has basic cable. Sometimes, we wish we could watch movies in the bedroom, so I decided to see what our options were. Since I am a Prime member, we had an entire catalog of TV shows and movies at our fingertips - on the computer. I decided to give the Fire TV Stick a try to see if we could now use the bedroom TV for something besides reality TV show reruns. Easy to install, but the little cable thing that comes with it is pretty short - and our TV is wall-mounted, so right now, we have it rigged so it doesn't hang down (we still need to figure that one out - thank goodness for velcro bands).The assortment of movies, TV shows and songs is great! And no fee (other than our Prime yearly fee). I would have given this 5 stars EXCEPT that twice during a movie, the screen buffered and we had to close out and start the movie back up again - a pain. But I'm not entirely sure it was Amazon Fire TV Stick's fault or if it was my network.This is a great value and a nice assortment of free and low-cost movies are available. We may get the Amazon Fire TV Box for the living room and cancel all 4 of our movie channels.
