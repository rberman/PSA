ChromeCAST.  that's basically all it does; it allows you to cast your phone, laptop, or workstation screen onto the TV.  It is not an AppleTV replacement, but it is really great to play your phone videos up onto the big screen.The app selection is pretty weak, but at $35 you get your moneys worth.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joe"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "This thing was just about as bad as streaming devices get. I thought this was going to be a lot like my Roku, but man was I disappointed. The things that you can stream on this thing are very limited, and even then the picture quality is awful and the streaming is clunky and slow. Also, lets say you're watching a show on Netflix and it's an older one from the 1990's. Obviously, things were not formatted into the 16:9 ratio that you probably have on your widescreen tv (it wasn't a popular format back then, like it is now). Unlike the Roku, the Chromecast does not fix the ratio problem automatically for you, so instead it leaves two big black bars on the sides of your screen. This can lead to black burns in the image of your very expensive tv if you are not careful with this. I'm sorry, but this tiny little device is not worth ruining my $3000 tv. This device will be on its way back to Amazon tomorrow.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rachel"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I wish Google would open this device to be able to stream anything I want to throw at it. I know it's probably more of a copyright issue than anything else but it seems very locked down for a company that produces the world's most open OS - Android. Maybe once people start developing more with the ADK (Android Development Kit) it'll be better but for now it'll work for streaming Netflix to a TV that doesn't have any apps or anything on it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

Once every 4-7 days I need to reset my router because the Chromecast can't connect to it, my phone, tablet, PC and Game consoles are all still connected but the Chromecast just won't. I would still buy it for the price, because it makes things like video streaming so easy, but just know that your router setup may give you issues like mine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert Joseph Cox Jr."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is just amazing product.I attached it to my iphone and my laptop and i can view netflix or youtube on a single swipe.I strongly recommend this as an alternate to lengthy cables.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "syedal26"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This little gadget great!!!!!! besides the advertised features there is another one that you can throw anything they you are currently viewing on your browser onto your TV.
