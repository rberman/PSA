He LOVES it. It was  very easy to set up and get connected. Navigation is easy as well. The remote is small sleek, very easy to use. Netflix and Hulu work great. We haven't messed around with any of the other apps too much. One that we couldn't find was Vudu which was dissapointing. However I guess it makes sense, amazon wants you to rent movies from them, not a 3rd party. Overall we are very happy with the purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mary A."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the stick! Was extremely easy to hook up.

I have a Google Chromecast, so I am familiar with a lot of the casting features. The Fire TV Stick is awesome because it gives you an interactive interface.You DO NOT need to be a Prime member, but it is definitely recommended because it will show you the TV shows and movies that are available on Prime. In addition, you can download apps and games to play. Some games do not require the game controller, sold separately, but some do. Some apps and games are free, while others are not (just like regular app store). Parental controls are available to use and are recommended. You can display photos / videos from your Amazon cloud account. You can cast streams from your phone to your TV (eg, Netflix, YouTube, etc). You can also use screen mirroring, available on most phones/tablets with it. Setup is a breeze. Would recommend!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Prodigious"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is fantastic!  The ONLY reason it isn't 5 stars in my opinion is because I can't run the sound through my external speakers.  I have to depend on the sound from my TV, not my surround sound system........bummer.  But, the unit itself is great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "P. Gangi \"Photo Guy\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product. We are having some \"hiccups\" when it comes to losing internet connectivity. I have found that if we make sure other wireless devices- i.e. Wii- are powered down, we don't have these issues. The design with the remote along with the software are great! Personally, I would wait until Amazon gets the bugs out before ordering this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Audrey Keith"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "makes my TV a smart TV but you need prime", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric Cunha"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very nice product. I own Roku stuff all over, but I bought this at the intro Prime price.I'd say it's still worth it at the full price and my only gripe is all the marketing crap that comes with.But, you get what you don't pay for and part of buying into Amazon is the ecosystem helping to supplement costs of some products.I'll take it.. cuz I like the price and quality is not sacrificed.I'd buy more if I didn't already have Roku stuff in every other room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KCMoSoxFan"}]
