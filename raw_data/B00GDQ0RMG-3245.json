I bought it  since it was release for the first time; and I had some WIFI connection problem because of the TV mount I had behind my TV; The Amazon extension was a little short to solve the problem. I bought a longer hdmi extension for about $10 on Amazon and the problem was solved. I can just ask Amazon to make a longer Extension for this since we have so many things behind the TV that can affect a WIFI connection.

I use it mainly for watching Netflix and Amazon Prime.  The fact that it's portable and so small makes it perfect for traveling.  As long as you have wifi wherever you are you have your whole movie library with you, and in HD no less. My only issue which is kinda big to me (particularly in comparison to my Roku player) is that the rewind and FF feature isn't as smooth as it could be. I almost always over-shoot in either direction when trying to get to the point in the video that I want to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Chuck from Middletown"}]
