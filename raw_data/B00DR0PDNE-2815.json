Contact with Google support probed fruitless.  A replacement was not provided after over 4 weeks of phone contacts.The call prior to this I was told I was going to have a replacement unit processed.  I then got an eMail 2 days after this later requiring my serial number- yes the very same number I gave the agent, and he verified he had recorded it.Just prior to Christmas a replacement unit was promised,.I was told all the hurdles were taken care of!  January 6 - nothing had appeared!  A phone call and some 3 hours, 15 minuets later, All I got were threats of no replacement, after a Manager in a different department found the notes and said this should not be a problem.  This manager transferred me to the \"correct\" department.  I say \"correct\" in quotes as this sure does not act like the correct department.  The agent that toke the call over did not transfer to management as I requested after, her telling me that the promise of a warranty replacement was null and void.  And did not have authorization.  Let's see - this is for a bad unit that has been confirmed to be less than 6 months old from manufacture.  And on a one year warranty?  Sound like Google just does not want to back it's warranty.This interaction is causing me to NEVER deal with a Google made product AGAIN.  Nothing but lack of support - and horrible customer service response.  Oh, and be warned that the call answers screen calls to the manager and insist n handling the problems themselves.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "35/42", "author": "David Anderson"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The video feed that it provides from my computer to the TV is very choppy.

Ourse.Youtube integration is seamless.The bad:Netflix integration is not so great. If I put a movie on pause, walk away, then come back, I routinely find I'm unable to restart the movie or even get the Netflix app to respond. Usually, stopping and starting the Netflix app once or twice 'fixes' the immediate issue. Sometimes, I must resort to unplugging and re-plugging in the power on the Chromecast and rebooting the iPad to reassert co trol over the Chromecast.
