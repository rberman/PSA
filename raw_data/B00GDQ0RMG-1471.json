Don't know why you would pay more for the bigger box.  I also have a Chrome Cast and I world recommend the stick over it.  The remote is nicer than using your phone or tablet to control the Chrome Cast.  The stick is also easier to travel with.  The Chrome cast would not hook up to my phone's hotspot for some reason but the Fire stick worked flawlessly.  I have heard other people recommend the Roku (I have not tried it) but being a prime member I think this is the best fit for me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kerry Taylor"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have an Apple TV2 as well.
