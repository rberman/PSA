At this point, we didn't really use it for anything other than watching Netflix. We decided to sell the Xbox and go with the Fire Stick.It takes less time to start up whatever you'd like to watch than our Xbox did, without any noticeable difference in streaming experience. Added bonus, you don't have to pull out your Xbox batteries or turn the controller back on! You just click the remote when Netflix asks if you're still watching (which, let's be real, happens regularly).If you're unsure about getting it, get it. It's $40, and it streams all of the necessities.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "I.
