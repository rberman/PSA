[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "It makes any tv with HDMI a smart tv...for under $40.  They don't advertise these like they could...I never need cable TV, or rent movies. I watch EVERYTHING on YouTube...if u look it's there. Even new movies and shows. Not to mention netflix, comedy central, crackle, hulu, etc etc...and if for some reason I do want to rent a movie I can on my phone to watch on chromecast. I can even play games on my phone on tv, using the phone like a controller. If you spent hundreds for a smart tv then you got robbed...i hate that no one is advertising the fact Chromecast makes expensive \"smart tvs\" obsolete. My neighbor just spent hundreds for one and it does exactly what I have with chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "rob griffin jr"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chore"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very satisfied with purchase", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
