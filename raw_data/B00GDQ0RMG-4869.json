I already own a Chromecast and I'll be honest I like this just as much as the Chromecast. We primarily use this with Plex, Youtube, and Prime. I like it because it feels more like a standalone product than does the Chromecast and the combo of my smartphone. The remote is super light and small and tends to get easily misplaced in our media room. If you have an Android OS phone I would download the Fire TV Stick App for the voice search. It works remarkably well and is very fluid.This is a five star product that I am giving four stars only because I wish Amazon would hurry and make it usable in hotels while traveling. Once that happens this would be a near perfect streamer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.
