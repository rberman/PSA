Simple and does an interesting task that with Android Phones and a Chromebook around is very handy...displaying content and managing a queue of content for display or playback through the media system I have.I've never had any luck with wi-fi for streaming however and it could be local RFI (noise) that breaks my wi-fi, have never figured out the source and I work in tech.  So this device can be hit or miss for me simply because my wi-fi is not stable.  It truly requires a stable wi-fi network to function.All my other streaming devices, smart DVD, XBox etc I use a cabled connection for this reason.
