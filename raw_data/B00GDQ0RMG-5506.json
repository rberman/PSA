Went through the setup process, installing Netflix and signing in. So far so good. Try to play something... Displays \"HDCP content not authorized\". Seems like it's not compatible with TV older than 5 years. Hell if I'll replace my Sony XBR6 because of some badly designed streaming stick. Returning the Fire TV Stick and will replace it with a Roku or Chromecast. Very disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jennifer Beaulieu"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome. Turns your tv into a smart tv for $40.

Google was first then Roku and finally Amazon. Amazon certainly learned from its peers but stopped a little short on the last lap. Google surpasses with app selection, Roku has the best user interface and Amazon has all of its vast content @ your fingertips. If you're an Amazonian  there is no question about getting this device. I have all of the above plus a Roku 3 and the only thing stopping me from getting an Amazon Fire Tv is Vudu. This stick however beats its competitors by sheer processing power, better connectivity and clean content(I feel like Roku is like walking into a flea market)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "DMC \"DMC\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use and even with my slower dsl it is extremely fast with virtually no lag. Extremely satisfied at this point and purchased it with intent to cut back on my dishnetwork subscriptions which I can certainly do at this point. I installed the fire tv remote app both on my kindle and android smart phone and the voice search works very well on both as do the controls on the app. Would recommend anyone purchasing the fire stick to download the remote app to your Kindle and android smart phone.

TV, Netfilx, Prime, Etc. are all easy to access. Using your phone as a backup when you loose the small remote in you bed is perfect when you want to be lazy!Wifi, Wifi, Wifi!!! If you have spotty wifi or too many people on your network, be warned. You will have to pause and hope for a better connection often. Sometimes, I give up and switch to my laptop because I get sick of waiting! I hope this can be fixed by updates in the future.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "olpmcg"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Got the device.  Followed instructions.  Seemed easy enough.  Wouldn't connect to any of the apps.  For example accessing my Netflix account.  I tried other apps.  It wouldn't connect.  Checked the connection.  Installed updates (so at least I know for sure it was connected to the internet) Still wouldn't connect.  Shows up in home network. But still won't do its only job which is to connect to the apps.  I must admit I am used to apple products which work out of the box.  My Apple TV took me less then 5 minutes to set up.  But even though Apple products are idiot proof I consider myself fully capable of manipulating electronic devices.  I have been working on this on and off for 2 hours.  So now what are my options?  Call support and waist another hour of my life?  No thanks,  I've wasted enough time.

Thankfully I picked it up during the 2 day sale otherwise I'd be upset. So what I like... It comes with everything think need. The stick, remote, batteries for the remote, power cord and adapter, and an HDMI extension cord. I like the remote design too, very nice in an elegant sort of way. What I don't like, the deal killer for me, was the fact that I have to pay $5 for the Plex app. I pay for the monthly service with Plex. The app on my Roku was free. The app on my phone was free, the app on my Smart TV was free. Why do I have to pay for the app here (especially when I already pay for the service)?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Jayms M"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Better than Google Chromecast.
