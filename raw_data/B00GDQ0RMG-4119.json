Had some issues at first, The first TV i plugged into everything would work but as soon as I went to the Disney JR Channel on the slingtv app the device just shutdown needing the be powered down and back on again. I then moved it to another TV where I had nothing but issues, after some searching I found that you MUST use the power supply that came with the stick and my TV's USB port did not have enough power.  The interface is just like its big brother the FireTV and 100 times better than the Roku.  My biggest concern and its the same for the FireTV they offer apps and games and no means of external storage.  With a few big games(Walking dead and Grand Theft) you run out of room very quickly.With the SlingTV app, netflix and plex I have been able to remove my cable service and I have never been happier.  This is a good product but if you can fit it I would suggest the FireTV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "YMB"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Worked fine and was simple to set up.  I deducted one star given that it was not made clear before my purchase that the device needed to be plugged in a separate outlet and not just USB power.

Netflix is a problem as well as Plex and Vevo. It's a shame too because i love the Stick's interface and ease of slecting apps and media. Love the remote as well. Id use the stick more if it werent for the Wifi problem.
