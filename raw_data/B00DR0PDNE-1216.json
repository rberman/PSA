It works for that, but isn't great.For one, it has to be plugged in --- either to a USB port (on your TV) or into an outlet. We found that, in order to get good uninterrupted signal, we really needed it plugged into an outlet. That may be troublesome for some people who won't want a cord running from this device (plugged into the TV) to a wall outlet. We were able to run it behind the TV and avoid the cord being visible.We are still learning what else this can do. Will update as we use it more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rebecca G."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great stuff", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Peppe"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "That dont work", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "hector marquez"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This is the worst product on the market, you cannot use it like a Blu-ray player or TV with embedded apps.

I ended up returning this product because of the lack of support from google, I hope the new Amazon Fire TV unit is way better, the amazon one looks to have app embedded so you don't need another device just to use it.

Works great and the picture quality is good. The only downside is that there are some compatibility issues and it doesn't work with most online TV channels and Stars Play.
