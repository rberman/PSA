Why I rate it one star is that the Stick is unreliable.  I get the message \"We are unable to connect to Amazon services.  Please check your Internet connection or try again later.\"  I select \"Go To Network Settings\" and \"Rescan for available Wi-Fi networks,\" which is followed by not finding any networks.  I'm writing and submitting this review using the Wi-Fi connection the Stick can't find.  At this point, the Stick is still glitchy.  Hopefully Amazon will fix the quirks for the next gen, but this version doesn't seem quite ready for distribution.  I don't have TV reception, so if it worked, it'd be 5 stars great simply for streaming Amazon content.

Not bad we loved it so much we had to order another for my son, so we ordered it from Staples as the one on here is out of stock until Mid February and we've been using it since before the new year and it works amazingly.
