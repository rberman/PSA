[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "The Fire Stick is the first USB streaming device I have purchased and it will be my last, which is not complimentary. Compared to the Roku box, the Fire Stick has a slow moving interface and slow response time. I didn't expect to have to download any of the apps to use, but it was only a minor annoyance. I downloaded Hulu Plus first, which gives rise to my prior statement. As I scrolled through the selections, the response from the remote was slow and it seemed the frame rate dropped to less than 10 frames per second. In addition, using the Fire Stick to input commands felt cumbersome, considering that it is a minimalist remote. Maybe a future update will fix this issue.Also, the home menu seems to be too cluttered and noisy. Compared to Roku (or even the PS4, which is still my primary streaming device), the Fire Stick's menu is all over the place and finding stuff easily is not its strong suit.With regards to the picture, I noticed that the device does not refresh at anything higher than 60Hz and sometimes it even dips from that. I have a Vizio 4K tv which native streaming services output at the higher refresh rate of 120Hz. Hopefully a future update will allow the Fire Stick to output at the higher rate.Overall, the Fire Stick is an okay device which has the potential to be much more. I won't be replacing my current streaming devices with the Fire Stick, but I think I'll give them to my kids as stocking stuffers since I only pay $20 for two. At this point, the Roku is still king of the standalone streaming devices, but if you have a PS4, Xbox One, or other device that streams I would use those over the Fire Stick as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C Bolts"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Pleasantly surprised at how great the product actually worked. I bought one in lieu of purchasing another Fire TV and possibly look for a less expensive alternative to it and a Google Chrome. The main reason I looked at it was its capability to play Plex TV. I was concerned as to whether or not it would be able to handle 1080p streaming from something that was not from the Amazon library. I tested it out on numerous movies and tv shows in different qualities and it was able to handle them better than even my Xbox One. The user interface is the same as the Fire TV, but at a fraction of the cost. It's great if you want to conserve counter space. It functions much like a Chromecast, so you should either have an outlet near your TV but it's even better if you have a USB port on your TV. The other big advantage is that it has built in storage so you can store apps versus casting it from your device. Suffice to say I gave my old Chromecast to my sister. I know this is gonna be a great stocking stuffer this Christmas.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "TechnoNerd"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great Addition to TV Viewing - this was easy to use - love being able to watch movies and tv shows on larger screen!

Very advanced streaming device but apps are limited and not as interesting or fun as my Ruku3 apps selections but it does what I needed for my second TV that uses a Winegard (clear see thru costco version) Flatwave amped antenna for over the air tv signals in my kitchen.~~~over and out~~~", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Donald C.

However, I haven't been able to figure out how to shut it off without unplugging it. And some of the apps freeze up. This second complaint is probably due to WiFi being not as fast as it could be. I usually use lan cable for fastest connection. Not an option with this device. I like that it's portable so can take with me when I go to friends house for movie nights.

Castro \"spaced boy\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I am enjoying setting up the FireTVStick but apps so far seem to be an issue. Example; I installed WifiMediaSync but when I go to install the client either on my PC or my Mac I cannot connect to the website, it doesn't seem to be accessible. This is bad as I cannot use the app without the client and I cannot download the client. I paid for this app so it is doubly disturbing that the company is not maintaining the website. For all I know WifiMediaSync doesn't even exist anymore. If that is the case the app shouldn't be listed for purchase.I will update this review as I test all the various functions and capabilities of the Stick.EDIT: WifiMediaSync finally accessed on my PC and Mac. Connected client to device and the connection is good but some confusion as to how to stream media. I will continue working on this.NOTE: When will engineers get with the times and design the power plugs so that the plug doesn't block one or more unused outlets on a power strip??? This is a continuing problem with all electronic devices. Smart designers turn the plug so it plugs from the side and doesn't block other outlets, BUT the FireTVStick is not one of those devices. The plug blocks a free outlet on my power strip thereby reducing the number of available outlets (unless I use the last outlet but then I have to unplug everything to rearrange the power cables).

Tying to use the soft keyboard for searching by selecting one character at a time is utter agony and very time-consuming, which is probably why the main way to find things to watch requires endless scrolling through thumbnails.Yes it has a Remote, which Chromecast does not. In essence the Remote becomes a extremely limited substitute for the PC (or Tablet, or Phone) that Chromecast requires for choosing and controlling videos. But it's functionality, compared to that of a PC is terribly limited.It would have been a bit nicer if the thing had actually worked right out of the box. It installed OK but I was then unable to play movies or TV shows from Amazon free of charge using my Prime account. Amazon Tier 1 support could not fix that.  Ironically, they all would play fine on my PC and  I could cast them to my TV by using Chromecast to cast the whole desktop.Chromecast - Yes.  fire TV Stick - No.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/5", "author": "user659"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "im use to netflicks.
