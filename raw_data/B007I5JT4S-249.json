Have only had for a weekend, but it's very user friendly.  It doesn't buffer or take a lot of time to play a show like my blu ray player does with it's netflix option.  It's very cool, cause you can stream your Iphone thru the apple tv so you have a lot of options even if your particular app is not on apple tv yet.  I would recommend!  Don't forget to purchase your HDM1 cable for it too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hizmunky"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Apple TV.
