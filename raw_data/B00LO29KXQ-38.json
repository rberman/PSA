That might be a plex problem and not so much an Amazon Fire TV stick problem. I'm not such a fan of a long USB cable having to hang off the stick and be tied together to plug into the nearby USB port on the TV. I think it should come with two cables, one short cable for the TV's USB and one long cable for when you need to use the USB power supply.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is awesome!

Turns off during shows so much it's unbearable. Probably turns off like 10 times every 30 minutes.  I contacted Amazon and they offered to send me a new one. They sent me just the stick - no plugs or cords - and that one does the same thing, leading me to believe the issue is likely the power source. Why the wouldn't replace the whole thing is beyond me. Now they will only offer me an 80% refund if I send both of the sticks back and I've spent HOURS on phone and chat support.
