With that said I am very pleased with the Fire TV Stick.  This stick turns the TV into a smart  TV.

I had almost forgotten about it and then it was here. Very simple to hook up (you do need to plug it in) and it was already signed in to my Amazon.com account. It works great, the picture quality is super and it works seamlessly with my prime account. Easy to access Netflix, YouTube and all the other services /apps. The remote is a nice addition and it works very well despite looking so simple. I would highly recommend the fire stick to anyone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "c smith"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The device itself is friendly with an easy to navigate interface. What is disappointing is the amount of Apps available for Fire TV.  If Amazon and the major TV networks can't reach an agreement to include their Apps, I don't believe this technology will last long.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael"}]
