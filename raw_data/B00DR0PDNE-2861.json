[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Perhaps later this year i will up the rating but so few apps support this device as to make it of pretty limited use.  For example it does not support Picasa.  That would be a major use for me and a great convenience.  If you have an older TV that does not have Hulu or Netflix built in I would raise the rating to 4 or 5 stars.It was extremely easy to install.  it does what it does well.  unfortunately it isn't much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Seymour Friedel \"Thing Doctor\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I purchased this primarily to test and see what you got for $35. The setup was incredibly easy to use and took around 5 minutes.My favorite feature is the sharing of specific tabs in Google Chrome with the chromecast.I have had streaming issues and there currently is not a lot if development for it. There is a tom of potential for Chrimecast, but it falls short in comparison to an Apple TV or Roku. That being said, the price is right and there is definitely $35 in value with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Harness TechED"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Great product design and effortless installation.

We are now able to connect our laptop computer (wirelessly) to our widescreen TV.  Once installed...the device is easy to use and picture quality is wonderful!  My only complaint has to do with initial setup.  My wife who has way better-than-average computer skills had to have a professional come over and complete the initial setup.  Router connection was more problematic than anticipated.  Chromecast works great but is definitely NOT a simple connect-and-go device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "R.

And so far not disappointed by their delivery.Here all you spend for the device is $35. The value you get is enormous. Netflix, Hulu and YouTube usually cover most streaming demands.

I have a LG Optimus G phone that it is not compatible with, a proscan tv that it is not compatible with, and an xfinity router that it doesn't like as well.

Worked right out of the box. iPhone apps - netflix works perfectly so does youtube - hbo go latent connection but will eventually work (this is more due to app than product). Chromecast via laptop (google browser) works perfectly and this all works with my DSL internet connection - amazing!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Delal"}]
