It's really a high-end media player for your TV. Movies TV photos and music and much, much more!. Share data with your mobile phone and your friends mobile phones or other android devices. You can download data from your computer right into your fire TV stick  Thank you. Oh by the way, you can upload data from your PC or Mac computer to a cloud storage device so you don't have to use up your internal memory which you can access from your fire TV stick remote. The only downside found is with the remote control. It doesn 't have voice commands on the remote you have to buy the second remote which is almost like the first for $29.95. Why didn't they use that parameter on the original remote. The other parameters are the same. Then just charge a few dollars more instead of $30 more for the second remote .You're taking advantage of the consumer!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Krisco Kid"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have a Vizio TV with wi-fi that has Amazon and several other streaming services (Netflix, Crackle, etc.).
