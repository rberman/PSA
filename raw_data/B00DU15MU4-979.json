Only because not only that I don't know of anyone in my circle of friends and family that own it but because I am used to Apple products. I LOVE it! There is so much content on it. I have the Prime membership and it makes it even a better experience to watch Prime Videos. I LOVE the fact I can just talk into the controller to find anything I want is an added feature. Very easy to set up and easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Della"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was going to ship my smart TV up to Maine so I could use my prime TV but after I saw this it sold me.  It works perfect with my 55\" TV and it saved me a lot of money and possible damage shipping my smart TV up to our vacation home...I LOVE IT works perfectly!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joseph S. Wolfson Sr."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "First, for newly-released DVDs for rent, no one beats Redbox.  Why would anyone pay six dollars when they can get the same DVD for $1.50?  I suppose Amazon, like Vudu and others, think people are so lazy that they are willing to pay more so they don't have to get off their behinds and get the DVD from a nearby Redbox.  Next, the DVDs that are offered through Prime are old movies.  Why pay $100 per year for that?  Netflix makes the same mistake -- their movies are old as well, unless one goes for the other Netflix plan that offers the newer ones.  That would only make sense if one is in the boonies, with no Redbox nearby, or if one rents more than four per month regularly.  Sure, for the time being the hardware and speed is second to none (excluding those that pay Cable or FIOS (same thing really) monopolies extra for their movie channels).  No other external plug-in comes close presently... but you know in time they will as technology allows.  Bottom line, Amazon, you need to bring your prices down on the newly released movies so you're in the same league as Redbox.  Take the view from the consumer instead of just maximizing your profit.  Nothing wrong with getting Prime and paying for it but make it worth while!  Don't charge extra for the newly released movies when we're already paying $100 per year.  Or at least keep it competitive with Redbox.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Anonymous"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my Fire TV!!!  Easy to operate, fast, the voice recognition is fantastic, and it has all of my OTT services.  The Fire TV is fast and reliable.  It arrived already synched up with my Amazon Prime account, which is awesome!!! I am still exploring the other features such as using movies I had on my network storage drive.I bought this item based on some of the other reviews on here that compared it to the Roku 3 and Apple TV.  My in-laws that live across the street have a Roku 3 stick that I have setup for them and used.  It is not a bad unit but I definitely prefer the Fire.  I am a fan of many Apple products, have a MacBook Pro, Airport Base Station, and some iPods (not a fan of iPhone), but I have used friends Apple TV systems and am not as impressed.  I have an Android Phone so I could not project from phone to set-top-box (STB), so that is not a feature that appeals to me from the Apple.  Also, to me the Apple is to locked down and Apple sometimes does not play well with others.All in all of the main options that are the big players out there, I would highly recommend the Fire TV above the competitors.When I learn more about the unit and use other features I will update this review.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "PB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Loving it works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tammy Soto"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Not very happy with the Amazon Fire TV. There are very limited apps for other TV viewing that I thought it would have. I have friends with a Roku and I know the variety of viewing apps that are loaded on. Amazon Fire TV has very few apps loaded on. The \"voice\" function is great but only works for Amazon viewing content. Very disappointing.Improvements to be made are: voice function works for the app you are in (as when in Netflix or YouTube), Add Apps... like BYUtv, KSL, Beck.. just suggestions.
