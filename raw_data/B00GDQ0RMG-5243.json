I figured it was the same device but the Fire TV Stick had the bonus of access to my Prime Instant Videos and Music.Unfortunatly this is a horribly made product and I'm unlikely to trust any Amazon branded electronics in the future.First of all, its incredible slow. Doesn't matter what app your using, there's tons of annoying lag. The Chromecast is as fast as a racecar.Secondly, its puckered with glitches (like when I try to browse my Video Watchlist but the titles and/or boxart/ and/or description will not load!)Additionally, apps sync to and from my phones and tablets terribly! I tried Youtube and about a dozen others. Videos would rarely load.ALSO lack of iOS support is inexcusable and HBO Go isn't coming till' a to be determined date next Spring.For the love of God, if your gonna get a streaming stick, get a Google Chromecast. Works like a dream and although it may lack Amazon Instant Video functionality, it at least WORKS as advertised! All the apps you could want, super fast speeds, and reliable interface: Chromecast is the way to go.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/8", "author": "Bobby Z"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Real easy to hook up works really good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kenneth e stock"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Netflix doesn't work on FireTV stick - one of the main reasons I wanted this device was fr Netflix.
