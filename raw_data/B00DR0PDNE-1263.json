Now if this whole casting thing improves just a bit more and we can access our favorite channels individually by subscription I will be SO HAPPY to get rid of cable!  I would love to have voice commands and I guess that this will be available on all the brands soon.

I returned it and bought the Chromecast instead.My daughters love it. They have Samsung tablets, and control the TV with them (you don't get a remote control, so you must have a computer, tablet or smart phone to communicate with the device).If your TV has a USB port, you can connect the device to an HDMI port and then power it from the USB port. Great solution. If you turn on the TV, it turns on. Turn the TV off, and you turn off the chromecast. No need to stop the movie before turning off the TV. You can also connect it to a wall, but then you would have to stop whatever you are watching besides turning off the TV.You can add an extension to Chrome (the browser) on a PC, and share your browser with the TV.A great product.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Armando L.

I want to see more apps, but sometimes you end up on sites and you will see the icon for Chromecast which means you can stream it to your Chromecast/T.V.  That being said it has also asked me if I wasn't to stream to my Roku.
