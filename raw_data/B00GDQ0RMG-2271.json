We took the Fire TV Stick with us on a short trip just after receiving it.  Plugged it into the TV at a Fairfield Inn; it booted up knowing my name, etc.  Next thing you know we are watching our favorite Prime TV and Netflix!  We are currently in Jamacia and using the device.  Internet is not as reliable, but that is not an issue with the Fire TV Stick.  Love it, love it - especially for the small price!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BMc"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Barely used.
