[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am extremely happy with my purchase and recommend this for anyone contemplating using less cable or no cable. You still need WiFi, but don't need the hassle of engaging the cable company, bi-annually, for a decent monthly bill, for the pleasure of cable TV access.In my opinion the Fire TV Stick is an ideal weapon (alternative) against the corporate greed of cable TV who are pricing themselves out of existence. We are a captive audience with very little say in cable company business.Since you can't get \"a la carte\" cable, the Fire Stick is the best and most cost effective alternative.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bobby"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great access to lots of movies with Prime Membership, at a great price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Wolfspecter"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works exacly as advertised.
