[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "If you have amazon prime it is great. But if you want to watch movies that you have on your computer it doesn't work well. You have to download an app called Plex and 80% of the time I try to watch a movie on my computer through Plex onto the TV it freezes up. Even at the lowest setting of 1mps 480 it still freezes up. Once there is a good interface to watch movies from your computer through Amazon Fire Stick it will be great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Only running it for a day but i love it. hulu connectivity is easy. tons of movies, crystal clear picture and sound. all this time i never used my hdmi input. what a waste.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
