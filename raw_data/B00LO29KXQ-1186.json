It isn't clear from the description that you do need power for this item, so be sure you have an open power plug in your entertainment power strip.  Set up was easy and straightforward and pretty intuitive.  Access to Amazon Prime programming was very easy.  Quite happy with this so far.  I wouldn't say the same for the iPhone App for controlling the TV Stick.  It is much less intuitive than just using the remote that comes with it.  That's why this gets four rather than five stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "COS \"COS\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Quick and easy setup.

We have no problems whatsoever watching NetFlix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu with the Fire Stick and if we want to watch live TV, we just switch to our digital antenna that receives 12 crystal clear digital channels in our area.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles D.
