Sorry I did.It can stream Netflix, Hulu+ and Pandora to the TV from another device. Whoopee! I can do that from the blu-ray player downstairs. I can do that from the Rokus I have in every room. I can send pictures across the room. I can play music that I have on one of my Android devices via the Chromecast.Why do I want to send pictures and music to my TV? The answer: I don't.What those don't do, and I wanted to do, was stream movies from my Android netbook (a homemade affair) that has tons of storage space. I can't. Period. I've tried nearly every app out there I can find. They either crash, do nothing or pretend to start streaming and never actually do it. I don't blame those apps. I blame the device. I blame the design of a device that won't let me send movies from a device I own to another one I own.To make sure the problem wasn't the netbook I made, I tried from my phone and my tablet. No workee. Same as the netbook.Get something useful if you're looking around. Get a Roku. It does the same thing and a lot more. There are even apps for Android devices (maybe iOS devices, too) that will let you use you handheld device as a remote for the Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Alan Brady"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love it for sending something from Netflix, or any web page.
