[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I bought Chromecast because I have subscription to educational video site lynda.com. This is the only on screen streaming device they support. It works really great with their service. I can control the videos using my phone as the remote control and i can follow along the software tutorials on my laptop. Netflix seems to work fine. Most of the apps are also available on my Roku Player so i have no plans on using chromecast for these", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Knowledge is Power"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Does the job but only really works well with YouTube vids", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "a pen name"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "the best", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alvaro Macedo Richieri"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "These were gifts.
