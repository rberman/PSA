[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Sometimes it works well and sometimes it does not work well at all.  I have emptied the cache's and still it either has an issue while playing a video, or it will advise that buffering will be a problem, (and it is;  it stalls and the video locks up while the audio continues, or it goes to black) even though the wireless connections indicates \"excellent, 54 mbps\".  I need to try connecting on my computer to see if that will work out better, BUT, the video is much more enjoyable and was intended for my 54\" flatscreen.  The best part of this fire stick are the photos on the screen saver that play  ---  whenever the program that I was watching crashes.  It's a great idea, but I think it needs more work.  By the way, the photos are interesting and beautiful.  Also, ironically, the first time I used it, it worked like a charm and played all the way through \"The Originals\"; even with commercials.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A. L.

To be honest I didn't expect much from a relatively young product like this, but I'm impressed.  It is as fast as the Roku 3 and for watching videos and playing music, just as good. In some ways it is better because Amazon's user interface is easier to browse media and apps within the Amazon cloud and store.  It uses the same UI for Netflix as the Roku 3.  I tried a few games and they were responsive.  I don't have the game controller, but I'll probably get one. One game kept crashing, but I don't blame the device.I love all three for different reasons and I'm happy to add this device to my collection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

This may be applicable elsewhere, but I first encountered the coins on the Fire TV Stick, so my feedback for them is going here.Just received my unit and wanted to buy an app.  It showed $4.99 or 499 coins.  I checked the price of 500 coins and it was $4.60.  Seemed like a better buy, so what they heck, I'll try to save $0.40.  I buy the coins and and try to purchase the app.  To my surprise the price was 499 coins PLUS 30 coins tax.  Want 30 coins?  Sorry, that's another $4.60.My chief complaint is that tax wasn't included in the price of coins listed for the app.  I'm sure this is explained everywhere and common sense, making my mistake my fault, but it was a real WTF for me.  I should have known better than to buy another currency.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bennett F.

I feel like the way to get people to use prime streaming more would be to get more content people want, rather than trying to force it upon them via interface.minus one star for the annoyingly square shaped plug, which covers more than one slot on power strip.  seems unnecessary and would have been easy to avoid in the design process.the interface is pretty smooth, but at certain times seems clunky and unintuitive.  overall the fire stick shows potential, but is not ready to replace my roku box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mitchell \"dystopias\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Very disappointed that the Fire TV Stick doesn't do Miracast streaming from my Microsoft Surface Pro 3.

Seriously when it works it's fine...not close to as workable as Roku, but fine.  However,  it never works. I just got the thing and already it's on the fritz. Good work Amazon. I will never buy another Amazon hardware product again. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!**Edit** Alright its been over a month with this thing and..I like it. The random rebooting and glitches seem to have gone away..mostly. Bizarre no? The channel selection isn't  nearly as robust as a Roku, but you have the big ones. What I'm really sweet on is the openness of the Fire TV stick. For example, I've sideloaded a couple of video game emulators, now I'm firing up the old Super Nintendo for some retro fun. Pairing a Bluetooth controller was a nightmare. I tried with a PS4 controller after reading it was compatible, no luck. I bought the Nyko gamepad for the fire..no luck. I had to side load android settings, finally I got the controller to pair. I know most people don't want this for games, but just thought id mention it. The actually device is snappy and does what it intended to. Sure its finicky at times, sure I wanted to throw it at the wall when I first got it, but its doing pretty well now. The ability to have Netflix, Prime, and Hulu in the form of a pocketable stick is nice. However, its that ability to side load android apps that really has me pleased. Hell I threw on XMBC on there and have a broader selection of content than any streaming device out there.Do I recommend it?... That's tricky. Out of the box, the Roku stick has more content available, its specs aren't as good but there are more channels, and  have yet to run into an unstable Roku. Fire is slightly cheaper, but is it worth saving a few dollars? Well, that depends.If you're the kind of person who likes to tinker a little bit you'll be greatly rewarded with the Fire TV Stick. Do a search for side loading fire TV, and you'll see exactly what I mean. However, if you just want hassle free plug and play, you're probably better off going with Roku and its ridiculous content catalog (though a ton it is crap). For me I'd go with the Fire every time.
