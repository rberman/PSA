We have found it to be very touchy. I struggle to have my phone'find it' half the time even though it's clearly working on the television side of things.moving the tv inevitably ends ina huge battle to hook the chromecast up again because it gets confused. It's so touchy we often have to unplug our microwave to make it work.

Why would this be an issue?  Well, on our LG TV the Chromecast would turn off when the TV was off, but our Best Buy Insignia TV would always provide constant power to the Chromecast, which in our bedroom turned out to be a nuisance at night, especially when the Chromecast went haywire and started flashing the light.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
