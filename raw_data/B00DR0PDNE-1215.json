Had to use a sneaky workaround to get the correct stuff downloaded to the tablet, because amazon(I can only assume) doesn't want to be friends with google.(This notion was further reinforced by the fact that my Google Play Music app is ALSO incompatible with the kindle fire).Anyhow, this workaround actually DID work, up until about 2 weeks ago, when they updated the OS for the Kindle Fires. Now, it is completely incompatible and there is no workaround. It's nicely timed with their release of the 'Fire Stick'. How convenient. WHY CAN'T YOU ALL YOU DAMN TECH COMPANIES GET ALONG.
