[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is one of the best products I have ever bought. It is one of the best for the price which you can't beat. Although I was certain to buy the Roku, the price and the usefulness of air play told me to go buy this one. Turns any TV into a smart TV! What's better is that if you have other apple products, you can use airplay to play play all your content from your mobile device to your TV. You can even use mirroring to stream your mobile devices screen to the TV. Would definitely recommend!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Alex"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Now I can see Netflix, You tube and my Ipad contents on the TV.
