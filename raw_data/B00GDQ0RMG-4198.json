My stick is probably 15 feet from my router (in direct line) and this thing drops the connection constantly. Even when it maintains a connection, video is choppy and stops to buffer all the time (Youtube seems particularly bad). Have spent hours trying to find a solution to no avail. It's essentially useless - glad I only paid $20 for it.Other gripe is that the UI is totally centered around Amazon video. It takes way too many clicks to launch other services like Netflix / Youtube.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "K.

It runs all the apps very well and it is super fast at starting videos.  Especially on Netfix and Amazon Prime Video.  I am coming from an older Apple TV and the picture quality is just as good.  And for the price point it cant be beat!  My only dislike is that screen sharing with an iPhone is not inherent.
