This is the first streaming device that I have owned and it has really helped make the move away from cable easier. There are some great things about the FtvS and a few things that have kept it from a 5 full stars.Pros:-Really snappy performance. There is very little lag between moving from one section to another or from opening one app or another.-Great that it comes with a remote. Performance and accessories were great selling points on this device.-There are many options for streaming services.-Now has Ios app.Cons:-It's deeply rooted in the Amazon environment. If you're already part of Amazon Prime and you use Amazon streaming services and rental services, this is a great accessory. I was looking at this device as an overall streaming machine and because it relies so heavily on Amazon, I knocked it back a star.-Search is limited to Amazon. I was hoping that all streaming services would be a little more integrated allowing me to put more shows and movies in one place.All in all, I have really been enjoying the FtvS.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jonathan De Leon \"Jono\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Hubby bought this for his \"man cave\".

I wish it was better at using local content off my home network.  Hopefully a future software update will fix that.  I do like this better than what is built into my current tv as the remote is much easier to navigate with than the TV remote.  Getting it for $20 bucks was great and you can take it with you and use it other places like while you are traveling or on vacation as long as there is an HDMI port to plug in to.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Reviewer  #5"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I just started using it a couple of weeks ago.
