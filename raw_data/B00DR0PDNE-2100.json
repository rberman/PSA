[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "It didnt work for my computer right away when it was setting up but when i used my phone it started to work", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bishwa D Pokharel"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I set this up on a Saturday night and started streaming a Netflix movie from my iPad.  I was disappointed to find that the only way to pause a streaming movie is to open the Netflix app on the iPad and press the pause button.  I think this is an inconvenient way to watch a movie, but to make matters worse, once my iPad turned off from inactivity, it could no longer locate the Chromecast.  In short, there was simply no way to pause the movie.  I wish there was an easier way to interact with the Chromecast but, unfortunately, there is no remote (physical or digital) to be used with the device.I was willing to accept this limited functionality since this product is much cheaper than similar alternatives.  However, my opinion has diminished greatly after the Chromecast damaged my Plasma TV set!  I turned the TV off Sunday night and woke up Monday morning for work.  My wife asked why the TV had been left on and I said that I wasn't sure, but I always turn the TV off when I'm done watching it.  Bear in mind, I'm always the one turning lights off behind my wife when she leaves them on.  You could almost say I'm OCD about turning things off when they are done being used.  Anyways, we both left for work on Monday and were surprised to find that the TV was on when we returned from work about 10 hours later.  The TV was on and the Chromecast \"Set Me Up\" screen was on the display.  It seems clear to me at this point that the Chromecast turned on the TV for no apparent reason.  If the nuisance of this wasn't bad enough, due to poor programming (and decision making) the \"Set Me Up\" screen does not shift at all on the screen and instead stays in place indefinitely.  The result is that I now have \"Set Me Up\" and the other Chromecast menu items burned into my Plasma TV's display.  It seems ludicrous to me that none of the geniuses at Google realized that the \"Set Me Up\" screen should periodically shift on the screen to avoid burn-in.  I have seen products perform this type of \"screen saver\" trick for many years; it is not a new concept and the exclusion of this simple protection seems unforgivable.UPDATE:  I have given this product a second chance.  I haven't looked to see if the burn-in is still evident on my Plasma, but I am hopeful it is only temporary.  I still do not particularly like the interaction between iPad and Chromecast -- it just seems cumbersome.  I streamed a movie last night using my Samsung phone and the results were better.  I was able to use lock-screen controls and the Chromecast was responsive to pause commands, etc.  This product is probably a decent replacement for the more expensive competing products, but the price point is probably the only attraction.  I will also point out that after hooking up the Chromecast again, it did turn on my TV and bring me to the \"Set Me Up\" screen.  From my previous experience, I know this screen does not lead to a screensaver and does not \"shift\" on the screen.  I think it is a really poor decision since this could lead to burn-in, as I experienced with my Plasma TV.  So far, it does not seem like the Chromecast will turn on the TV unless it is prompting for the initial set up, via the \"Set Me Up\" screen.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "E.

Cooley \"Lord Disney\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "After buying a Nexus 7 (2013) tablet, I was intrigued at what the combo of the tablet + Google's Chromecast would give me. At just $35 it was easy to buy for the sake of experimentation. Setup took but 5 minutes - plug-in the Chromecast to the back of my HDTV, connect the power cable, and Chromecast is ready to connect to the tablet. The only thing I wasn't so thrilled about was how every Chromecast advertisement shows the Chromecast connected to the TV with no cables - yet in order for it to function you need to provide it with a power source, either by luck of having a USB power source on your TV, cable box, or other nearby device - or by using the included AC adaptor and USB cable. Connecting the Chromecast to my tablet (as well as my iPhone) was simple and easy thanks to the on-screen instructions.Edited: With no included remote, controlling media is strictly done through your outboard device (after installing the free Chromecast app). Watching YouTube and Netflix is as simple as firing up the app, picking a video, and tapping the \"Cast\" button to send it to the Chromecast. Once the Chromecast takes over getting the feed, you can put the outboard device away... that is, until it's time to play something else. Even something simple like pausing or rewinding part of the video for a replay means that you always have to have your outboard device handy; this isn't instantaneous either, since doing so requires you to first get your outboard device out of sleep mode (and/or passcode unlock it if you use security) then go to the app that is streaming to the Chromecast - before you can do anything with the currently playing video - at least that's how it was with my iPhone 5, and my Nexus Tablet. When in the lockscreen, I had no controls on my phone, and in Netflix my tablet only gave me a pause button.The other available source to cast from is your desktop computer; with Chrome browser and the Chromecast extenion installed, getting media to the Chromecast works the same way - it will \"cast\" the current browser tab to your TV screen. However, I did notice that even with my relatively new PC, playback was not as smooth as I had hoped. Many times the video/audio was either jittery or out of sync. Also, while i didn't notice any weird playback when using my iPhone or Nexus 7 tablet, when using my PC the PC itself would use a lot of resources, and any change in network activity (even something as simple as checking my email) would affect the cast and playback would suffer.Also, your WiFi connection is extremely important, given that the Chromecast relies on WiFi as its only means of data transmission. With my WiFi router in the same room as the Chromecast, I didn't notice any lag or playback issues. However, when I moved the Chromecast to the living room TV, playback was hit or miss depending on the app I was using and the quality of the video I was playing.Edited: App-wise, the Chromecast has a very short useful lineup compared to other streaming devices like the Apple TV or a Roku. Examples of services that I personally like to use that are not supported (yet) include NBAtv and Amazon Instant video. Sure, I could use the tabcast feature from my browser, but I already covered how that isn't that great of an experience. And as a commenter mentioned, technically there are \"over 250\" Chromecast-compatible apps on the market, but after browsing the list IMO many of them are more of the utility-type with no actual content (look at photos from your device on your TV), and others are not really useful per se, but more like \"just because we figured out how to get it on the TV\" - for example, I don't think I'm going to go through the whole process of turning on my tv and getting Chromecast fired up simply to... write a text message on my TV. Or play 2048. Or read tweets. It's also a sign that development for useful (as in entertaining) content is still in its infancy considering the fact that the actual Google Chromecast website only list 17 of these \"over 250\" apps that actually are worth using. Not surprisingly, the Chromecast works best with Google Movies, Google TV, and Google Music. I'm sure they are good services, but I'm already a paid subscriber to Spotify and iTunes Match - so those Google services are realistically only useful to me IF I'm already using those services. That's like saying an AppleTV is great because it's the only device to support iCloud and iTunes Match... which is fine, but again - only if you already use iCould and iTunes Match.Added: The Chromecast can turn on your HDTV and switch it to the correct HDMI input if yout TV supports \"HDMI-CEC.\" It's a nice bonus - but only IF your tv supports it, which mine does not. Even if it did, that would be only 1/2 the job since I still would have to turn on my home theater's A/V receiver for audio. As is, no points gained or lost there =)All in all, at $35 the Chromecast is an ok purchase for someone who likes gadgets and wants to get some content from their tablet/phone to their TV. Yet for all of the potential that Chromecast has, the available apps list needs more useful, entertainment-providing content. For me, at $35 it's worth keeping just to see how far the little guy goes. I'm a gadget guy; I'm ok with it. If the Chromecast cost $50 or more I'm pretty sure I would have  returned it to try the Roku Stick instead, which seems to have more of what I was expecting to get from the Chromecast in the first place.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James R."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Juan Martin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great little device, you can use it to watch from any mobile device or computer, nice and compact so you can take it with you when you travel.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "john livingstone"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Exactly what i want.Perfect assembly.Work fast.Good Wifi connection.High video quality.It works perfect with a chromebook", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "matias"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own 2 of these already, probably going to get a 3rd.
