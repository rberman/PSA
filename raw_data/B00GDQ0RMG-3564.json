Though there is a Back button, that either gets you out of the current app you're in or the current app will show a message like \"this function is unavailable\".Maybe a double-press of the Back button can be used by the apps to act like a Last/Recent button.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!
