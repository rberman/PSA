The technology seems to be in the Alpha stage.  Its a decent proof of concept but there are huge problems (see below)CONS: Doesn't connect and poor implementationI've looked around at forums and can't find a good solution.  My chromecast is 25 feet away from the wifi router (Belken N, two antenna, extra range and power, over $100 when it was purchased).  The chromecast usually can't connect unless you reset it about 5 or 10 times (soft and hard resets both produce similar results).  My roommate bought a second chromecast and it performed in the exact same way.  There's no interference, the TV is not next to an outside wall, and the XBOX and Playstation get great wifi connection just fine and they're only about 2 or 2.5 feet away from where the chromecast sits.  The worst part is its intermittent so nailing down the problem is difficult and because of that I haven't even tried to send it back.FURTHER NOTES:Youtube in particular has terrible options for tagging mobile and casted videos.  Some videos are only available through a PC, some only through mobile, and some that are on mobile can't be sent to the chrome cast (even though its basically the same thing).  There's not really a way to tell in advance and its incredibly frustrating, the screen will just throw an error leaving you confused.  There needs to be standardization across platforms because in this day in age people want all of the internet everywhere they go, not just whatever the video owner decides to accidently click on in the upload options.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "ANDY G \"ANDY\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "...is basically how I use the chromecast.
