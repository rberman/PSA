While the features are great, especially being able to verbally call up movies, I have found that when movies play, the scenes shot at night or in dark rooms are virtually impossible to see.  I tried adjusting the TV's brightness and other controls to no avail.  I have a Roku player on my TV up front and I do not have that problem.  The TV I had the Fire Stick on was a Samsung 27\" LED, and the TV with the Roku on it is a Samsung 37\" LCD.  i am going to try another similar product and see if that makes a difference. .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Billf"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Has worked flawlessly over the last few months since purchased!

I give it a 5 star. It's very fast, I like the processor speed, the memory is a decent amount. I'm glad I bought this and as as gift for mother's day. More faster than the Roku 2 box and cheaper in price . I recommend this to anyone. Buy it, it's awesome!
