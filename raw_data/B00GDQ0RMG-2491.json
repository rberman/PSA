I am well pleased with the stick except it doesn't allow me to use social media on the TV.  I have another Kindle where I hook into the TV directly using mirror imaging.  I can show everyone what I'm searching for and use social media.  It's not wireless but it works.  I hope the developers come up with a program where I can do this remotely.  Also, the remote app has limited use even though it presents a keyboard.  Other than those two things, it's a great product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tate-Ray"}]
