Adler \"@aribadler\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Speedy stick for the most part, but falls short with several shortcommings.First off, you cannot use a universal remote with this device. I understand the 'back of the tv' method means only bluetooth works for it, but so far haven't seen any remotes that say they can control this device. The included remote sucks, its insanely uncomfortable to use. All of this wouldn't be such an issue if I could control it with my Kindle Fire...oh what's that you say, Amazon certainly should make an app for their own device first? Not if you have an older Kindle, apparently Amazon wants you to just throw those old things away instead of make them useful (because come on, a friggin remote control app shouldn't be that computationally intense that a tablet like the Kindle Fire cannot run). I can run Roku's app on my Kindle Fire, but not Amazon's own Kindle Fire remote, hmmm....I've also had to enter my Wifi password a few times already, and have had shows in Netflix that I try to start in the middle of the episode (where I left off) and the screen just displays '99%' on the buffering, it plays the sound from the episode, but never loads the actual video for the show.For $20, sure, its not bad. But at $40, I'd recommend the Roku LT before I recommend the Fire TV Stick (and truthfully, you can get Roku 3's now as low as $60 if you look around, which I would recommend even moreso).I will end this review by stating that my friggin thumb is sore from using the included remote, that thing is so uncomfortable to use, easily the worst remote I think I've ever used, and being a technology geek I've probably used close to 100+ remotes in my life.I will update this review as time goes on, but first impressions aren't very impressive. I will keep this as I got it for $20, but would not recommend it full price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "14/16", "author": "P.

I also own a Chromecast and will probably be using both at the same time for a while until the Fire TV Stick updates to be able to mirror my computer screen and finally gets the iOS app out there.1. Setting upIt plugs into an HDMI and they recommend you plug it into a wall outlet using a USB charger (all included, as well as a small extension wire for the HDMI to TV connection. I guess this is for TVs close to a wall so that you don't have the Fire stick jutting out of the back.Once connected to my wifi, it took a few minutes to download and install updates. Then a little animated guy showed up on the tv to give me an intro of what it can do.My Amazon Prime music library and playlists were in there when I signed in with my Amazon account. My watchlist for Prime video was there too. There are a lot of game apps also playable on the tv which my children seemed excited about. (The Amazon Fire game controller also works with it.)2. Compared with ChromecastI am still waiting for the iOS App and hopefully something to \"fling\" my computer screen to the tv like Chromecast's still-in-beta \"cast entire screen\". I believe I'll be able to change it to 5 stars once those two things get worked out.I still enjoy Chromecast for mirroring my computer screen, and sending chrome tabs to the tv. It's also very convenient now that many apps such as Netflix and Hulu include chromecast integration.Where Fire TV Stick is a step up is that I don't need my computer, tablet, or phone to \"cast\" something to it so kids can just watch Netflix, Disney Channel App, or Hulu from the stick itself and there's no need for another device. (You can also set some Parental Controls).I'm happy with the Fire TV Stick and using it alongside Chromecast because there are still things that one can do that the other can't. It's now the one we use for watching Amazon Prime, Netflix, and listening to music through the tv. Chromecast is still the one I use for casting my computer screen.3. InterfaceI love that it has a remote control and the remote control is small, and that I don't need to fiddle with another device in order to work it (although there are ways to work it from a cell phone). The remote is 4.5 in. x 1.5 in.One more thing in which I hope and expect to see improvements is the way users access apps such as Netflix or Hulu. I want to have a customizable homescreen with easy access to the apps and features I use the most. Right now it feels a little less intuitive than it could be.It's also a great way to access music on the tv for people like me that don't have a better sound system than the one that came with the tv. With Pandora, iHeartRadio, Amazon Music, and other apps, it's a great way to throw some music on in the background.4. The Remote ControlAs I mentioned above, it's a good size (4.5\"x1.5\"). The battery compartment was a little hard to open.It may be too much to ask but if the remote here had a button to control the volume on the tv it would be convenient for when switching between videos or apps that have different sound outputs.Lastly, and it needs to be said, I love the fact that it's a tiny stick in the back of my tv that gives me access to a lot of content without needing another device to interface with it. I'm looking forward to gradual improvements, updates, and customizability.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

Lookofsky"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Easy setup, but after two failed attempts to update the software using the TV's USB port I decided it really did need the power adapter. This device obviously draws a lot more power than my Chromecast which works fine with a 500 mA TV USB port. Bought a Dual USB A to mini B \"Y\" cable to supply double current to Fire Stick only to discover the Fire Stick end of cable is not mini B ( haven't verified if it is micro B but will order new Y cable and check that out). Assuming this will eliminate the ugly wire from the power adapter to my wall mounted TV, my next concerns are with operating characteristics. I noted several times when I could not connect to my home router ( even though neither my TV or Chromecast ever have this problem). Also, during the times the Fire Stick worked properly, it often paused for buffering during Netflix content play. Again, I don't ever see buffering when watching Netflix on my Smart TV or via the Chromecast. The Fire Stick seems to be a little better in initial Netflix download time than either my TV or Chromecast, perhaps due to its additional processor power. Overall, it was worth the $20 price (on the initial Amazon offering) because it gives me access to Amazon Prime which neither my TV or Chromcast has.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jack"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great.
