I mainly use it with apps on my phone. It's very easy to just cast what im watching up to the screen. The one downside is that it is quite difficult to mirror screen if your screen has video on it. The quality can be damaged if you don't actually use something that has chromecast support. It's gaining more and more support as time passes (netflix, hbo go, starz play, youtube), and it works quite well with each of these services.The setup is super easy and you can be up and streaming on your chromecast in less than ten minutes.Overall, it's an excellent streaming stick. You may not like it as much if you prefer to be able to use a universal remote to control everything, but other than  this, it's great. It's cheaper than the ROKU stick and does most of the major services as well. It's a nice thing to have on hand if you just want a simple way to stream.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James Smithe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Simple setup!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jim Ward"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The product is what I have expected to be.
