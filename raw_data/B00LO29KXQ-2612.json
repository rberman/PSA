Pretty much all the apps I use work pretty well except for MLB.TV. I bought this so that I can watch my baseball on my tv as I got rid of my cable. The buffering while using MLB.TV is aweful! No matter what I do nothing has fixed this and my bandwidth always comes in no less than 3x what is needed....Until Amazon can fix the problem, this product will only get 3 stars....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joseph"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great value and awesome product.
