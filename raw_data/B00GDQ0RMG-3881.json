Our router is on a different floor, and there's no way to achieve that distance.

Like many other reviewers, I've now gone through two of these and neither of them work.  The original was defective, so Amazon sent me a new one.  I was ecstatic that it seems to plug in and work with easy set up.  Unfortunately I had about a week of use before it began incessantly scanning, connecting, saving, disconnecting, scanning... you get the idea.  It saw my network, strong signal but it just simply could not stay connected.  I've rebooted it and spent far more time wasted on trying to fix it than it is clearly worth.  I would like to try the fire tv box in the hope that it works better, but now I'm pretty gun-shy about these devices in general.  I guess I'll go back to the roku.  Both are going back today.  A word to Amazon-  don't put products out that are sketchy on their reliability- every time you do that, you lose credibility with your customers.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bridget Kaub"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Much better than my Roku 2 .

I have yet to be able to use the fire stick to watch a program where it does not reset and disconnect multiple times saying device error an internet connection is required.  The setting show I have a full strength \"Very Good\" signal strength and this is the only device that continually fails.  Even with no other devices turned on.. I cant watch more than 3 minutes of a show before it drops signal and resets.  If this was more than $35 I would be more upset - but it just isn't worth the time and frustration to fight with it.I renewed Netflix and have effectively moved on from even trying to use firestick.  I tested it again because I got the request to review.... 4 minutes in to a show and it disconnected.Gary Busey was wrong, the sea shell is much more valuable - it doesn't waste my time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Adventure Dives"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mattie Logan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this.
