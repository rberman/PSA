[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like this Amazon Stick version for my internet TV viewing. For many years I've been using my droid tablet or smart phone HDMI connections to stream internet media but last year with Amazon Prime I lost that capability due to Motorola and Samsung devices loosing the licensed option with Amazon. The stick is a very good low cost alternative and it allows you to access most all your internet streaming desires. Its very fast and pretty easy to use. My only con would be it has to be plugged into a electrical outlet somewhere near the tv and does not have a battery power alternative... otherwise I and my wife like and use it often.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing little gadget and I am totally impressed esp for the price.

It lags a lot more than I had expected coming from Amazon.  I activated the Plex app for 500 coins (one-time activation) however it is trying to make me activate it again.  I looked into this issue and the problem isn't with the Plex app itself but due to Amazon's activation failing.  Until this issue is resolved I cannot give this product more than 1 star especially since Plex works so well on all my other devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Daniel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this!! I am trying to convince my husband to cut back our cable so I ordered this. It is great. I can always find something to watch and I love that it is easy enough for my five year old to operate.

It runs smooth and even allows apps to be side-loaded. There is the free application manager app from amazon you can use to manage all applications instead of going to the system menu. It'll list all the side-loaded apps too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Andras"}]
