[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I bought this and so far I really like it, it is portable and small. I watch a lot of netflix on it. One thing that I have noticed about it is that it needs to load a lot. Several times per episode of shows I watch. It really doesn't take long for it to finish loading, but it can be a slight inconvenience. My boyfriends mom came over while I was using it and she noticed that it was doing that and she said that hers does that as well. Also, I have used mine in different places with different internet providers and it does it everywhere I have used it so I do not believe that is the issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tonya"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was easy to hook up and gives lots of viewing options, a good investment", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "paul miller"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great and wonderful ever......wow product...!!!its worth it ---- just $35 bucks...wow its amzing.....i love it a lot....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rajesh Rajput"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I have a slow internet service (DSL) - though I liked the interface & remote control - when compared with my Google stick - no comparison.

With this device Amazon has decided to place their Prime content in their own sandbox for which I must condemn their action.  Data needs to be free! I bought this because a member of my household doesn't want to start the PS4 to watch Amazon Prime, and Amazon Prime isn't available to be cast to Chromecast or AppleTV for some reason.So now I have a Chromecast that I use for everything and Amazon TV Stick that I use for Amazon Prime content.There is ONE good thing about this device.  When it is setup, anyone on the network can use it - thank you for not making us sign in to different account credentials from different devices.But, please start playing nicely with Google devices and Apple devices and Roku etc. I shouldn't need to own this, but alas I do.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Mizzle655"}]
