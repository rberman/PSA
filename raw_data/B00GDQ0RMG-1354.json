It is a bargain. It works well with The Firestick Android APP.There are some complaints with 'mirroring' but I have not tried with Amazon Kindle, and I suspectthat it may be more of a problem with the Android software than the Fire Stick. All in all, I would recommentd thisto all Prime customers, without reservation. I have a Google Chromestick as well and I like it too, but this unitaugments the Amazon experience seamlessly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Was quite surprised that it actually ran fine on a 5 gbps DSL connection.  My smart tv would run like crap, constantly buffering.  I\u2019m using a 30 mbps cable conection on it and it still buffers and gets confused when paused sometimes.  On the negative side, it's pretty limited for other apps.  Roku was better.  You can get Netflix, Youtube, and Hulu Plus, and a couple useless junk apps.  Also the remote is really flimsy, freezes and has to be put to sleep and woke back up sometimes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Roy A.

It would simply not connect, or sometimes connect and interrupt the connection all the time. When I called Amazon, they told me about incompatibility with certain Brands, and told me there is a way of fixing it by changing the settings on both the stick and the modem. I was hesitant to change the settings of the modem because of what may happen to cable and fixed phone line coming from the same modem. Then I decided to give it a try, but unfortunately apparently not all representatives know about this trick, so the one I spoke with the 2nd time I called had no clue about it. This stick was for my kids' TV so they were very disappointed. I was initially going to buy the Amazon TV box instead, thanks God I didn't.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "La Reya \"La Reya\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far so good, really cant complain", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "well from my point of view its ok"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Fire TV Stick!
