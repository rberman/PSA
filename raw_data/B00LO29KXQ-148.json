The fire stick is extremely inconsistent. Often it doesn't load the show or movie and even more often it cuts in and out. Almost like the service just disconnects for awhile. I know it's not my internet because as I mentioned I also have a roku and I never have problems with it. Fire stick is definitely convienent and extremely portable but it's just not reliable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "JB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My bedroom TV isn't a \"Smart\" TV, so the Fire TV Stick has been great for those times evenings I want to watch a movie from my bedroom..
