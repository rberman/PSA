We had an old 30\" Samsung flatscreen that was collecting dust since we did not want to pay for an extra cable box. The Chromecast allows us to stream from both Netflix and HBO Go which is what we watch a majority of the time. The picture quality is excellent, almost surprisingly so. It can still be flaky here and there with connecting, but mostly works without a hitch.I'm looking forward to more Tier I apps (hello Amazon?) but for $30 it's hard to go wrong.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James Sherhart"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Setup took an hour since it requires network updates to accept the new device. I have been using this device for two months now and it's great when it works but it's only worked a few times. My TV does not detect the device regardless of how many times I go through the setup process. Sometimes resetting the wireless router works, now it doesn't. I have a 8yr old wii that never fails in streaming and I have gone back to using that device.
