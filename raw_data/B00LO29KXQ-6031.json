When amazon announced their fire tv stick I was intrigued. When I saw the special pre order pricing, I jumped at it and promptly forgot about it until it showed up.Setup was slightly annoying because immediately there was an update and a video you couldn't skip on how to use it. Once the update and stupid video were done, you are presented with a very nice interface.Now to use it. The amazon prime interface was nice and lets you want free prime stuff as well as order the more premium content. I generally stick with the free content and it seemed to work well. I also use plex a lot to stream things from my NAS and this worked great, though I had to buy the plex app again.The remote is also a nice touch. I have the chrome cast and it's nice to be able to use my phone but it can also be a bit of a pain at times. It's nice that this doesn't require a phone so you can just hand the remote to someone to use rather than use the phone.I don't know how much I'd use all the other features. I think most people have their photos and music in the cloud with google and/or apple so I'm not sure how willing I'd be to also copy things over to the amazon cloud but I may play with it one of these days.Personally, I think if you have amazon prime and use plex, this thing is worth it just to be able to nicely bring both of those to the tv easily in a nice small package. If I want to show people photos, the chrome cast already has access to my google+ photos so that works better than this. However if I want to watch amazon prime videos, this is clearly the winner. Plex works on both. I think I'll still keep them both, especially considering they are both relatively inexpensive.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christopher Flynn \"daytona955i\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I was so excited to finally find a product that supports both HBO and Showtime, however it doesn't not really. It does not support Showtime with Direct TV as a provider, Seriously??? It's only the 3rd or 4th largest and the largest via satellite and it only provides some programming from HBO via Prime so it is essentially useless to me. There is also no type of app store amazon or otherwise where you can download apps you can only use the ones provided for by the stick which is very limited. It also runs very slow so slow that it keeps telling me that itself and suggests I check my connection, which I run everything else on with no issues.

My Roku 3 is better but this is fine.  Apps that are free on Roku are not free on the Fire Stick,", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. Rainey"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I own a Roku stick and since I had Prime I decided to try this. The interface is better than the Roku. The games are also a nice touch. I would put the Fire stick over the Roku. Three things stand out over the Roku right now. Interface, the games and the price. The specs seem to be better as well more ram etc. Also when your playing say a TV series on the Roku I have yet to find a setting that will play each episode consectutively you have to pick up the remote and press play for the next episode.  With the Fire Stick it will show you that the next episode is getting ready to play at the bottom right of the screen and then automatically play it without you having to do anything.  I think that might put me over the edge and I'm pretty sure I will eventually buy a second stick and put it on my main TV because of that.  Very simple yet convenient feature.  Just noticed it yesterday after using the Roku and I tried to find setting to fix it but no luck.  The set up was also very easy.  I didn't even have to log in to my amazon account.  When I connected to my home Wifi it took about 10 minutes of time to download software updates and then it was ready to use.  When I set up the Roku it took me 2 hours because I got the dreaded error 014 (or something like that) and it took me forever to find the fix to get it to work.  Overall I'm very happy with the Fire Stick vs. the Roku Stick.  There is also an extension for your HDMI hook up which is helpful if you have no room behind your TV for the stick.  I normally don't preorder anything so I was a little hesitant because this was the first wave of product to hit the customer and normally I'm sure there may be bugs to work out.  So far, so good, overall very happy with it.  I would highly recommend if you don't have a smart TV or are looking for something smaller than a streaming box.Updated: 12-21-14I have to retrack my statement about the Roku Stick.  The newest software update that the Roku has sent out allows the TV episode that you are watching to continue play without having to hit anything on the remote.  Big improvement but the interface is still the same.  Since this was a Fire TV review, I still really like the Fire TV stick.  It's in my bedroom and comes in handy when there is nothing on TV.  I stil like the interface with better than the Roku and would still but the Fire Stick over the Roku Stick for the same three reasons above.  Interface, games and price are still the factors as to why I would tell someone to get the Fire Stick over the Roku Stick.Updated: 6-3-15Had to knock off a star for this device.  Because between the Roku and Amazon Stick you get more chanels and options from the Roku than the Stick.  For example, I was watching documentaries on PBS on the Roku on my main TV in the living room.  When I went upstairs to keep watching it in bed the Amazon Stick had no way of showing it.  Becuase it didn't have a PBS channel or app to chose from.  With the PBS channel on the Roku you can watch pretty recent episodes and shows.  I will say that there are features and things on the Amazon stick that are not on the Roku but after a few months I would rather have another Roku stick to replace the Amazon Stick.  The only reason I won't is my kids like to play the games on the Amazon Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J-Rod"}]
