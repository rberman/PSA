[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "In my opinion, Amazon did pretty well about this Fire TV Stick. I'm an existing prime member and have recently received this item (my profile was pre-installed in the system). I plugged the TV stick at the HDMI port of the TV (plus following other steps on the supplied document), connected it on the network using the supplied remote (this is very user friendly and easy to navigate - excellent remote) and everything went smoothly. I have added (downloaded) Netflix, PBS, History and Youtube on the program. My Router (Network) is approx. 20 ft away from the TV stick (using the 5 GHz wireless band) and the HD reception on the TV is really good.I am using my android phone as a secondary remote (have downloaded the app from the Google play store). That's neat.My big mistake; I should have bought (pre-ordered) another two when it was being offered at a discount. I have learned my lesson (i.e. my expression; okay, now moving forward).I have chromecast too and if asked which one to buy next for the other TV's, the choice is clearly Amazon's Fire TV Stick. I would highly recommend this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Mitless"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick was very easy to set up.  I was pleased to see how many apps are available for the Fire TV Stick, much more than I expected.  It is easy to navigate with the minimalist remote.  I have not tried the Android remote app yet but intend to do so soon.  I wish I had bought more of these as gifts.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JJ"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Mine would not allow me to log in.

Connected it to our receiver and surround sound system without any issues.  Love using Pandora on the surround.  So glad I bought two.

I bought it because it was on sale and I saw that ESPN3 was available to watch with this device. Any other device I use to watch ESPN3 I have a lot of buffering, the picture going from HD to SD and back to HD and many times when the sporting event goes to commercial the picture freezes requiring a complete reboot of the system to get it working again. Using the same wireless network that I have used in the past I watched a couple different NCAA football games this past weekend and had no problems with the picture.I also have used it to watch content on Netflix, Hulu+ and Amazon Unlimited Instant Videos with no problems. On my PS3 play back of Netflix and Hulu+ was always very good but when watching content on Amazon Videos I would get a lot of buffering.If your looking for a good and inexpensive way to watch online content through your TV I think this is a very good choice.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "HuntleyMC"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I got this already having had a roku 2 and apple tv. I can say it is a mid level performer. It is not as fast as the apple tv but faster than the roku 2. The one thing that made it a must have for me was the Hulu Plus app. The Hulu Plus app on the Roku 2 is hot garbage and almost completely unusable. The app on Fire TV stick was much better, still a bit slow compared with Apple TV, but at least useable. Overall, I would recommend it for people who don't care about HBOGo (which it doesn't have).A few things to note before you get it:1) Fire TV stick told me that the usb port on my TV didn't provide enough power so I had to plug it in using the wall adapter. Which is not a big issue for me since I have power right behind my tv.2) The Fire TV was has lots of issues with WiFi connectivity until I changed its location. On my roku this causes the occasional slowness. On Fire TV, it meant that I could not control it anymore with the remote.3) There is no iOS app right now, so if that sort of thing is important to you, I would hold off.4) As mentioned above, there is no HBOGo. However, I did find most other apps, History Channel, Hulu Plus, Netflix, etc... Also, the apps seemed snappier than the roku 2, but not as good as apple TV. However, this is 60 cheaper than apple TV so the trade off is acceptable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kaveh Noorbakhsh"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Way better than I expected.  We live in a rural area where DSL and Cable internet are not options.  That means slower internet and long buffering times for streamed content.  I have been able to stream Netflix through our 4 year old Sony Blu-ray player with some success, I have also streamed using Android phones with less success and a bit better streaming when I connect my Windows tablet to the TV.  So the $20 pre-purchase price was the only reason I felt it was worth the gamble on buying another internet streaming device.Success.If I knew it would work this well, I would have bought the Fire TV Stick at full price.  For streamed content this device maximizes slower internet connections.  I use a rural broadcast Wi Fi network which does not have the lag times of satellite I used in the past, but it isn't lightning fast, yet the streaming on the Fire Stick is quick and painless.  Netflix works well, as expected, but better still, I can stream Amazon Video.  This is something I have not been able to do well, even on a computer, because of the constant buffering.  On the Fire Stick so far, no buffering. The video quality is better too.  The way my Blu-Ray and Computer makes up for less buffering time is lower video quality.  The Fire TV Stick video isn't always 100% HD, but it is vastly better than the streamed content on other devices on my internet connection.  I Heart Radio streams without buffering pauses over my home Wi-Fi.  Streaming I Heart Radio over a phone using my home Wi-Fi experiences occasional buffering pauses so I typically disable the Wi-Fi on the phone to stream that content over my 4g network.  On the Fire TV Stick though, I can stream I Heart Radio over my home Wi-Fi without the same buffering pauses.I can also play my home network stored music using the available Plex App.  I had previously set up my network to play my music content via the Plex app on the Blu-Ray and tablet, which worked, but there were long waits while my music content buffered on my own network. On the Plex ap available for the Fire TV Stick, I can access my home network stored music content quicker and with more success.In short, it is well worth the price.  Thanks.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lost Weekend"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works beautifully.  I love that I can now watch Amazon Prime shows along with my Netflix shows and listen to Spotify all through this device.  I also have Google Chromecast and would recommend the Fire TV Stick a million times over GC (I have had some difficulties in GC playing Netflix stuff and it is very difficult to play Amazon Prime shows on it).  I love how easy it is to search of shows/movies using the Android app and the remote is very nifty as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bridgegirljen02"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The fire stick is a wonderful concept.  The first day I had installed the streaming device all worked well with the amazon prime videos.  I believe after the new software update I could no longer stream the videos.  even the ones I owned.  The message I received \"HDCB not authorized.  Content restricted\".  Spent about 3 hours with service folks.  After all done and reinstalled software and setting it back to factory defaults it still gives the same message.  It was an issue they have no answer for as of yet. They told me they were sending my information to the tech who are developing the software.  That was two weeks ago.  no response since then.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Salvatore A.

While some privacy advocates may get a little squeamish over it; I like the fact that the device was registered to my prime account when it arrived. The only action I had to take for setup was entering my wireless router password. Navigation is intuitive.
