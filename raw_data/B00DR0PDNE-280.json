Chromecast is an affordable alternative that rivals much more expensive devices. You can stream from your mobile devices (both Android and iOS), or directly from a computer.  Some of the apps are exclusively Android (which makes sense, since it's a Google product), but there are plenty of apps for iOS, as well. If you review the apps available on the Google Website, I think you'll agree that Chromecast is a no-brainer addition to any household's media center.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Moombamimi"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like it.
