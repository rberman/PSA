I own a Chromecast as well, and I have to say Fire TV is a serious contender. My only complaint: at the time of writing this review, there is no YouTube app (at least I was shocked by this).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark A Zavala"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "easy to set up, under 5 min.
