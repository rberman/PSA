Whle they do have many to choose from they don't have my main music app RDIO. I got a prime membership for Christmas. So the stick works well for me. Hoping they get more apps soon though....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "a. strickland"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This sucks! I tried to watch a movie I rented and couldn't.

I run android, and a chromecast ended up being much better overall, so I end up using the fire stick only for amazon prime video or when I want to rent a video that's only available from amazon. Seems uninspired on the whole, but functional. If you had a roku I'd say it's probably not worth bothering with fireTv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris Peterson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to work with.

What a great buy!! I've been wanting a streaming device for my bedroom because I don't have cable in there. It was easy to set up and it works like a charm! No issues with buffering and my prime account was already linked to the device. My mother has a chrome cast which is also a good streaming stick. But I would recommend the fire stick over the chrome cast for a couple of reasons 1) it comes with a remote so you don't have to use your phone or tablet 2) access to amazon prime (this includes video and MUSIC!!) 3) the hardware is just better. $19 was a steal, but I would have gladly paid $39.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "D'A ngelo Ramos"}]
