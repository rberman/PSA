Same as Roku. I found the remote very user-unfriendly and downloaded the app to my (Android) smartphone. This setup works well. The device offers access to streaming services that are also vailable via Roku, such as Netflix of Watch ESPN. - As an Amazon Prime member one is supposed to have access to tons of movies. Using Fire Stick I found that the access to free stuff appears to be limited and the Fire Stick device wants to lead one to PURCHASE videos.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "alius"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "If you're not a prime member, you practically have to buy or rent anything that's worth watching.
