You get waaaaay more viewing options, including Amazon Instant Video. This is especially great if you're a Prime member. Everything you do with Chromecast has to be controlled from your computer!! The Fire TV Stick comes with a great little remote control. The only thing the Fire TV Stick is lacking is HBO Go, and that is supposed to be coming this spring. It's the perfect, inexpensive option for adding Netflix, Amazon Instant video, Hulu Plus, Showtime Anytime and soon as I said, HBO Go to your TV. Not to mention games, music, and a Windows screen mirroring app also coming soon. Some people complain that it has to be plugged in to a power source. This should not be a big deal, as your TV should be near a power source anyway. But if you have a revent model TV and it has a USB port, you can plug it into the USB port for power, eliminating the need for an electrical outlet to be used. For the price, it is pure perfection. It simply can't be beat.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Pac Deo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "now if we can get our KC royals we will be golden!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Larry Linhardt"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Cool device, works well, has a lot of features and provides a lot of entertainment for the TVs that cannot get all such content or that aren't smart...
