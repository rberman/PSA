My long time stable home wireless network now is a constant worry.  My tablet and phone will not connect to the internet once Chromecast has been turned on without first unplugging Chromecast, then unplugging the modem, then powering off each of my devices, then plugging the modem back in, then powering up each device, forgetting my network on each, signing back on to my network on each device, and then *trying* (50% success rate) to connect to my network.  Nobody has any answers for this, though through googling I've found others with the problem.  To me, Chromecast is not worth all this trouble, and it is going back.  I just hope I can somehow get my wireless network back to its customary exemplary operation once Chromecast is out of here!!
