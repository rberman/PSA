[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy to have our Fire Stick! It's very simple to set up. Thanks, Amazon, for such an affordable streaming device that works!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My Fire TV Stick arrived today - not sure how I could buy it from BestBuy.com more than a month before it is available from Amazon, but I could. Great Apple-level elegant packaging. Beautiful interface. Almost all of the apps I cared about on Roku (this replaces my dead original Roku box - the first one Roku ever sold). It is well integrated with Amazon streaming, which I hoped/figured it would be. All of the songs I've downloaded and many of the albums I've bought from Amazon are instantly available to stream. I'm very happy with it and highly recommend it. It is the first piece of Amazon hardware I have ever bought - job well done, Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have used Fire Stick for 2 days and am very impressed with its ease of set up, remote response time, clarity and sharpness of videos and tv programs. The screen saver is full of beautiful scenery.  I uploaded Netflix and the video is sharper than when I watched it on my blue-Ray. Amazon Prime is the best value around. So much entertainment for so little money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This would be a reasonable media streamer if it wasn't completely let down by abysmal wifi speeds.My first inkling of trouble was when attempting to connect to our network. I entered my password, and the stick spent several minutes \"connecting\", only to fail. The failure wasn't because of a bad password or anything like that; it actually failed to connect to amazon.com, This persisted until the third attempt.After the fireTV-for-dummies video was done playing, I proceeded to install the netflix and plex clients. The app menu was blank except for text; it took several minutes for the icons for the app to load, and about 15 minutes for the two apps.Netflix was a buffering mess. The plex client showed *no* image metadata for anything at any point, and took thee minutes to start playing the one movie I tried, only for it to buffer after 5 seconds of playing.There's nothing wrong with our wifi; a two year-old Nexus 7 is capable of doing all this and more from the next room with nary a hiccup, but the fire TV stick is incapable of doing pretty much anything from a distance of 3-4 feet with clear line of sight.The worst part about this product is that there must've been a whole team of Amazonians that signed off on the stick in its current state. More than one person at Amazon tested this thing and decided \"Yup, that's a shippable product; it's as good as it can possibly be.\" Either that, or they hold us users in such contempt that they thought we wouldn't notice. I'm not sure what's worse, to be honest.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Craig"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this stick! It's incredibly easy to set up, easy to use, and remarkably clean UI.

I love the idea of casting apps to the TV, but the reality of it is broken, laggy, and unreliable. Having a physical IR remote is still the best way to instantly interact with your TV. It pretty much combines the best of ALL worlds (Chromecast + Roku + AppleTV = Fire Stick).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Another Great Amazon product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i loved my chromecast until i got this.  its Almost the same thing but the interface is great and having that silly remote is actually supper nice.  once Amazon fixes the phone app this thing will be perfect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So everything works great. Super fast compared to my Roku.The only knock against it is that with my SGS5 (Verizon/even tried a hard reset on both devices), it will not screen mirror.
