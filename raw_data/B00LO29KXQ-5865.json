I am also incorporating them into our Church's media distribution system in combination with a Plex server.  I have conducted testing with both the ROKU Streaming Stick and Fire TV Stick in low signal WIFI conditions.  ROKU Streaming stick had extensive buffering most of the time.  Fire TV stick other than about a 2 second initial buffer, ran smoothly with no issues.  On the CON side, I am disappointed with the configuration of the Parental Controls on the Fire TV Stick, as it requires you to enter your PIN to watch videos included with Prime for no charge!  Quite annoying and a security problem as if an unauthorized user is present they can see you enter the PIN on the screen, not very secure.  I'm waiting for the promised enhancement that will allow me to hook up to hotel WIFI when traveling that require web confirmation.  Overall I'm happy with it, I just hope they work on the minor annoyances I mentioned.  Additionally, the Android remote app needs work as it is very hard to work with and often responds erratically.  For instance it will interpret a click for a swipe  and swipes are not smooth.  I would reprogram with buttons rather than swipe or at least use a button for the click feature.  Voice feature is cool, but wish it worked across all apps e.g. Netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard Gutknecht"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great way to watch Amazon Prime shows & incorporate Netflix into 1 device.

Setup was a breeze and the video is excellent as is the sound.Out of the Box the Fire TV stick was easy to set up and has an intuitive interface. A short into video when you first active the device was a nice touch and coves the rudimentary operation. The device offrs more than just Prime TV with the ability to run other apps that include Netflix and Hulu+.There is no lag between the remote and the device. The fact that other controllers are available is a bonus and even better, there is an app that allows you to use your smart phone and voice commands.I purchased this on a bit of a whim. This is one of the rare occasions where I am really pleased that I acted on the impulse.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adrian Sebborn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just got it and it was easy to set-up and it has been working great with no issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Excellent"}]
