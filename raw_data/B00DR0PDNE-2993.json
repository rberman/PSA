[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this yesterday and I love it. The setup is simple as plugging it in and following the directions on the screen. I can't get enough of it. It definitely beats having to watch hulu plus on my chromebook by a long shot. When I was streaming from my chromebook, I noticed that it was lagging. But, once I streamed it from my phone it was perfect. I don't miss watching regular tv anymore because it seems like nothing is ever on. Not only can I watch whatever I want on my tv whenever I want, I can also listen to music from google play. Im sure many people are wondering if their tv can support chromecast, well most, if not all tvs can support it. All you need is an HDMI port, the usb port is optional because the chromecast comes with a usb cord and a wall charger that can attach to one another so that you can plug it into the wall but, an HDMI port is a must. So, go buy one, it's totally worth it.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Israel Johnson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wow!

It is compact, portable and allows you to have an easy interface with which to stream Netflix, YouTube, HBO and Hulu shows.  All you need is a wifi connection and possible a power outlet (unless you have an HDMI 1.4 port on your TV, which provides power to the device).  All streaming is controlled from a mobile device (iPhone/iPad/Android) and you use the standard apps to control the streaming functionality.I was looking for a cheaper alternative to an AppleTV and a Roku.  This thing is GREAT.  And they are adding additional app support over time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rob"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Great concept, poor execution. Probably going to return it. Tried to use my iPad 2, but the Chromecast apps requires having ios 6 or 7. Unless I jailbreak it, that can't be done. Then, using a totally new Moto X or my chrome via my laptop, I can't use the amazon instant video app. I'm not a super technical user, but I knew enough to disable silverlight, but still wasn't able to get it working. So what do you have left? Youtube? That's not sufficient content ... rather go with AppleTV then.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "S.

I could get it to cast from my android tablet with no problems.  I continued to load the new cast applications, and came across the \"Flex\" app and had to work with it for a few days to understand how to use it, After about a week, I have purchased another one and a new 32 inch tv for my bedroom.

There are plenty of free services that make the purchase worth it but i would recommend subscribing to other services. You can watch Korean dramas for free :).

This has radically changed the way we watch tv. We can watch anything online for free. We are now debating dropping cable tv and just sticking with high speed internet. Between Netflix, Amazon Prime, and this - well, the only thing we are missing is network \"news\" and we are about two days behind on series based television - well, who cares?!?!?!  I can stream BBC or other news programs and series based television that is not \"reality\" crapola can wait a couple days. I'm very impressed with Chromecast.

Youtube, Netflix, and Pandora. However, dealing with 3 separate devices with slow and clunky interfaces meant it was sometimes more trouble that it was worth to use these services (i.e. it literally took 3-5 min to open the YouTube app and locate the video I wanted to see).Enter the Chromecast. It's beautifuly simple...with a one-click \"sent to\" option using my phone's native app, I can shoot a video to my TV faster than it takes my Panasonic player to even turn on. And weirdly, with the recent addition of HBO Go, I can now get my on-demand videos in HD (which Time Warner doesn't yet provide for on-demand).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "seriously this is the best device ever. constantly upgrading the software, i never have to leave my couch to do anything and it doesn't take up any space at all. i run plex on it and it's fantastic, handles my 1080p movies like a boss.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ryan"}]
