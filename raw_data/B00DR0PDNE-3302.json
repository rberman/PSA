This device makes it so easy for you to stream your favorite videos, shows, movies on a bigger screen. It also connects pretty fast and the HD quality is amazing. The only thing I wish it allowed me to do is to be able to display my computer screen so I can do other things like display powerpoint presentations.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Raymond Wong"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Google Chromecast has proved to be such a useful purchase!  Install was almost seamless.  I have successfully used Chromecast on six different TVs without a hitch.  The quality of Hulu+ and Netflix (the main two things I utilize) have been exceptional.  This little bugger is great for people who travel often, want to turn their TV into a smart TV, or someone who likes to show off their tech prowess.  I did notice a slight loss of quality when transmitting YouTube.  Also, I've been at a friend's house and their router was rather mediocre, and the Chromecast reflected this via loss in quality/random loss of connection.  I would recommend, and have recommended this product, to all of my friends and family!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nicholas C.

I didn't do more research when I bought because I was under the impression that it would stream from the chrome web browser but it doesn't . So basically it's a YouTube streamer.

OZGUL"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Pretty much a mediocre product at best. Streaming Netflix from Chrome on the Mac hangs at 25% and does nothing for hours at a time yet the same video plays fine on the desktop client. If you try and cast the Netflix tab, it won't use audio unless you use the Cast from Netflix, which then resets and... hangs at 25%. I have been able to Cast an Xfinity video page and watch it, so it's not a worthless product, but I can do that on-demand already (did it as a test to see what would happen). Not a total waste of $35, but pretty close.Oh yeah, and Amazon Videos won't work full screen, nor will it push audio. My sub-par rating might be too high.

If I want to go to other sites I can not watch or view the website. Its sucks. I thought I can use my TV as a monitor for my laptop.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BlueOx"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We are loving this, it is so convenient to watch and control Netflix (and Youtube) from the table or couch.  We have an adaptor that plugs in and streams whatever is showing on the phone but then you have to get up to do anything with the phone and the adaptor is specific for your phone where Chromecast works with any device connected to the same WiFi network.  Also, very, very nice that you can use your device (phone or tablet) for anything else you want while streaming, talk on the phone, play games while my son is watching a movie, etc.  I look forward to being able to stream more than Netflix and Youtube (we do not have Hulu and do not use Google Movies) but for now we are using this daily and love it.  Highly recommended for $35!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daphne Cilliers"}]
