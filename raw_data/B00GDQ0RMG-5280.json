I have both an Apple tv and Chromecast. The chromecast is slow, not an easy device to use, dare I say not ready for primetime. The apple tv is great device and works well but will cost you $100. The fire stick does  everything the apple will do at a fraction of the price. What I like most about the FireStick is its ability to download apps and using your smart phone as a remote that you can use voice commands.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

Works perfectly with Netflix and all of the apps run well. I haven't tried Hulu yet, but so far, it's great!!I bought the Calm fireplace app and it looks great on our tv screen.My husband likes the NFL app on the big screen.It's great for sending shows from my Kindle fire hdx 7\" to the tv.I got this when it was on sale for $19, but it's worth the full $39 and then some.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "wanda"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazon's Fire Stick exceeded my expectations. It is small, immediately responsive to the remote and very fast for streaming content.

Works flawlessly with my Prime Membership. It was easy to set up, and the menu system is straight forward.  I really enjoy the Bluetooth remote, why aren't ALL remotes Bluetooth? We use it for watching free prime movies and listening to prime music collections. The screensaver has some nice pictures.  You can tell the pictures have a Seattle area influence. I got a Fire TV for Christmas, but as we aren't gamers, we kept the Fire Stick. Overall I would definitely buy again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dthraco"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got my Fire stick for $19, figuring I could retrofit a regular TV into a \"smart TV\" with little risk.It's perfect!  I plugged it in, signed into my Prime and Netflix accounts and I'm set. I've been binge watching some series during the holiday hiatus and it has worked flawlessly with both.  I look forward to getting HBO go in the spring.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tania M."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to set up and works great. I plugged it into an empty HDMI port of my AV receiver, put the USB connector into a wall adaptor (for powering the stick) and was going in a few minutes. I think all I needed to do was enter my wifi password. Everything fromVine Videos was there and more. Nice to not have to hook up a laptop.Prime music could be better integrated. As it is you have to select things on a PC beforehand to add to your music and then you can listen to just those things.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gabriel's Buddy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was easy setting up even for me at 71 years of age.
