I have a HDMI box that connects a sound bar, Apple TV, and this (when I had it) to my Samsung tv.  Apple TV never missed a beat. This stick would not work most of the time.  You get what you pay for. I will say that I did talk to customer service once and they ran me through some testing that helped for a little while. They were very nice and helpful, so Customer Service I liked, product not so much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DCarnahan"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice interface and app availablity compared to chrome .....got kodi and the rest is history......2 thumbs up", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ch8ch \"ch8ch\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It is not really good to stream hulu or Netflix.
