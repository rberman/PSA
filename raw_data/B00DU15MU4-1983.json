I do like the interface on the roku alot better,  but i can look past that, the thing i hate about this device is that it keeps draining the battery,  fire tv wont consistently go to sleep. I really hate this been the only reasin i got it was cause i was tired of having to charge my ps4 controller,  and now i essentially have the same problem. I preordered the firestick now im second guessing it. Definetly roku 3 is my top streamer", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "E. Melo"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The Fire TV works well.  I've used it 3 times in as many weeks.  BUT I have a big complaint. The batteries in the remote control have been dead each time I've tried to use it.  So I've had to replace the 2 AAA batteries 3 times in as many weeks.  This is unacceptable.  I have many other devices powered by AAA batteries, and none of them have exhibited this problem.  I've decided to remove the batteries between uses, which is really rather ridiculous.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Ephraim Gadsby"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "can't believe i lived without this my whole life - slightly bitter that the stick is coming out at half the price though :(", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "partsladysam"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love Love Love it!! So easy to use! Great remote!

I like the Roku3 but it has been giving me headaches occasionally with the remote failing to operate.  So when the Fire went on sale I was very interested, especially since it appeared to have a rotary controller around the select button similar to an apple ipod.  Unfortunately it only looks like that but functions like a regular four direction switch.  In order of user interface preference, I like the Apple, the Roku3 and then the Fire. I chose to purchase the latter two because the apple had the least amount of processing capability and was highly recommended to those you have other apple devices to interface with.  All devices work as advertised and I highly recommend all of them to folks who couldn't afford the high end price of a smart TV.  We use them almost exclusively to access Netflix and Youtube and are quite happy.  The Roku remote seems to work again after fiddling with the channel selection on my wireless router I seem to be back in business.  Sorry if I digress but I hope that maybe the extra info maybe of help to someone.  Happy watching...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "dp"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "the only thing we don't like about it is the prime, none of the good movies are free , you get more from netflix", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jessica m hemery"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best purchase around.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeremy"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This is honestly the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. Now I am a loyal Amazon customer I have only had a kindle and use my prime very often. I wanted a device that would let me watch netflix as well as other things and I thought the Amazon Fire TV was going to perfect. Mind you I paid the $99 instead of the $84 that is now. The first day netlfix and pandora kept crashing. Then it got to the point where i can not use anything on this thing except for Amazon Prime movies and TV. It keeps saying my server is down even though I have checked my internet and I have reset countless times and i can not being it back to my factory settings. Now I had hopes that maybe this would all be fixed with an update. What happens? The thing wont even update! So I call Amazon Customer Service 3 times, after doing the same thing that did not work for 3 different people, they still refuse to give me a new one, instead they say that it will get fixed and they will return my call/email. All I receive was $5 toward an Amazon purchase... Stay tuned to see if it ever gets fixed!.POINT BLANK: Your better off with Roku or any other brand and I am sticking to this until proven otherwise.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/6", "author": "maries2cute"}]
