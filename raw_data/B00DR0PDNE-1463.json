It is working now but it took a good bit of time to adapt it to the T.V., get it up and running with Netflix and keep it casting. Perhaps it was operator error. I do know that at times itstops casting and everything has to restart. It's an O.K. product and as I said before it is working most of the time.

Got it on a promo with a NAS HDD.  I have a smart TV and a Windows Media Center box, so I wasn't planning on getting a Chromecast.  There's very little it does for me that I didn't already have set up.  It has some cool features, though.If you don't have a smart TV, or are looking for a quick and easy way to \"beam\" content from your mobile device to your TV, this is it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Garry Adams"}]
