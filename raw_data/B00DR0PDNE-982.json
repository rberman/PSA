This is a great little device if you watch a lot of internet videos. Works with any laptop, Android, or iPhone. The compatible apps are growing constantly. Decent WiFi and internet are a must, otherwise you will have lag. Works great as a wireless speaker too, just hook it up to the HDMI port on your home stereo system, and viola! You have your stereo streaming Pandora. Overall, you should definitely consider this if you want to easily watch basically any internet video on your big screen.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Daniel Weaver"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Couldn't  live with out it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gary R."}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "What a shame.I have tried to get this to work for :3 weeks now.It will not work.I am sending this back.I will buy Roku.I know that it works with Apple products", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott loomis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So much you can do with this!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Moonshine"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Was simple to set up", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lane Coonrod"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Chromecast, have four, one for every tv in the house.
