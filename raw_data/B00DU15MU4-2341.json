Absolutely silent, very fast, runs Netflix, Amazon Prime video and, of course, supports Plex streaming. Really a great package overall, with a super easy to use User Interface, remote is easy to use and the voice navigation is really solid. It even works well with foreign accents (tried with native French, Italian, and German speakers). 1080p performance is rock solid.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Zaphod"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It won't work for my usage. I have tons of local content which I view via Plex. I have a Roku 3 and the Plex app was free. I found that the Plex app for Amazon Fire TV was $5! That right there made my mind up to return it. This would be great for someone who has a lot of Amazon content however. I'm a collector so I buy everything I want on physical media eaning Blurays and CDs etc and then make digital copies that I can use on my own personal network so that I do not have to insert the discs everytime I want to view them. I can't search my local media using the voice search either so for me that feature is useless. Maybe a future model will help with some of this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/4", "author": "Scott F.

Have you ever had to clear data or clear cache on your android phone because the app stops works.  Well hope you like that process because it happens ALL the time with the FireTV.  Amazon video, Netflix, Hulu, all of them will throw and error saying \"Video is Currently Unabailable\", so often this device is unusable.  The only fix I've found is to clear cache and data multiple times and power off the device for 10 seconds.  When you finally get to boot it back up get ready to enter you Netflix and Hulu credentials again, because we had to clear them.Stick with other devices, the FireTV simply does not work.I'd sell this device if I could, but Amazon doesn't allow used sales for their devices.  Something to think about, you'll be stuck with it or left to sell it on Craigslist or eBay.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/9", "author": "M.

We are using it to watch Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime on the TV.. In fact, we're really thinking with the Hulu Plus, we could just do without Dish Tv, which just gets more expensive all the time.. Instead of paying $90 a month, we could just pay Hulu Plus $7.99 a month.. Quite a savings..We're going to use it for awhile and see if we find we can watch just as much on Hulu as Dish, and if so, bye bye dish bill...It was super easy to hook up...I'm a 60 year old woman and found it simple to hook up/use... I purchased an inexpensive HDMI cable from Amazon, got it out of the box, followed the directions and had it hooked up in less than 1/2 hour.I really like that we can speak into the remote control with a name of a movie or show and the system will find it for us... You can also type in the name of programs/tv's for the system to find..The picture is clear and the sound is great.. Once in awhile we'll have a frame freeze up, but I think that has more to do with our internet connection than with the fire tv... That's actually rare and far between.1 year update: We have dumped the Dish and watch most of our programming from the amazon fire. We have hulu plus, netflix, amazon prime and showtime.. For the most part, it's working great and saving us a bundle..The picture quality is great, and no more constant blurps in the picture like we always had with dish.  My one big complaint is that we can't pull in CBS all access on the fire.... Thinking of getting a chromecast or Roku in order to watch CBS..We don't use it for gaming, but we do listen to the variety of music channels occassionally, which come over great.. I have used certain apps that just don't work that great, like Lifetime for instance... But that is the exception rather than the rule..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Karen \"Karen of Northern Michigan\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it, it dose all you said and very easy to operate.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Kathy Lou"}]
