[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like this very much. I have used it for four trips on hotel televisions with mostly good results. The networks at the hotels I stay at have a web page which brings up the sign in page for the WiFi. The interface, setup, and features are impressive and easy to navigate. I would have given five stars except for minor quirks:1) There is no native YouTube app. The knock-off app works well enough. This isn't a surprise as my Kindle Fire HD tablet has the same issue.2) I've had to clear the data on the device. It wasn't obvious that it was the cause as it reported as \"network\" issues. It was easy enough to do, but I shouldn't have to after only four times out of the box.3) The iPhone app uses WiFi instead of Bluetooth. Communication between devices on WiFi is understandably blocked by firewalls of the hotel.4) This is not an issue with the Fire product, but it bears mentioning: Some hotels have a mode which blocks \"aux input.\" In these cases, I have had to revert back to using my laptop to stream video.I will still give this a firm recommendation and would purchase again if I had to do it over. The packaging is nice for repacking and traveling across the USA with this thing in my backpack.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G.
