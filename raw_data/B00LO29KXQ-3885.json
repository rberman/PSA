[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "OK we tried the Roku and ended up sending this back to the store, this would not connect to the local networks. So I decided to send for the Amazon Fire stick and I am so glad I did. Absolutely no problem hooking this to the TV. Within minutes this hooked up and was showing all videos and tv shows and everything needed on the apps to watch live tv. Even movies I had never seen...yeh. Got so sick and tired of all the stupid, worthless reality shows, we had to do something more than watching re runs of 48 hours, criminal minds, NYPD blue. So,  Amazon Fire stick has given us something new to watch. You, have all your favorites plus more. I joined Prime and deleted Netflix Prime have a better selection. Now I can delete most of the direct tv that we pay over $100 a month for and just keep the basic. Apart from saving on the direct tv we now have better tv thankx to Amazon Fire stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Johanna"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I do like the Amazon Fire TV Stick but was hoping more movies than what I found would be a bit less costly.

There is absolutely no way you can go wrong with the Fire Stick and combining Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mick Paul \"Eric D.
