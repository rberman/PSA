I am a senior and love being able to get all of my childhood shows,,, The Lone Ranger, Ozzie and Harriet, Amos n Andy, The Honeymooners, Dukes of Hazzard, Charlie Chan Mysteries, Dobie Gillis,  etc. I'm not a big fan of all of this reality TV craze that dominates TV these days.. So, I have fun watching the old nostalgic programs and movies from my childhood, high school and college days. Amazon Prime is perfect for me. It gets everything. So far, anything that comes to mind I can get with the Fire TV stick. Thanks Amazon for doing it right once again.Cliff", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Clifford W.

But buyer beware - we had to upgrade and move our router closer to tv as this draws a lot of bandwith. Tooled around for 2 weeks until we got it to stream - with much help from Amazon's tech service personnel who were terrific.Love this for kids to watch amazon prime, and we can take with us to another location which is great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "K.
