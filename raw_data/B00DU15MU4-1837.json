The system has to be reset frequently.  I am not sure if it is my bandwidth or something in the unit.  I have a blue ray in another room and I don't have the problems I have connecting and staying connected with that unit.  The Fire loses audio, not video, but audio.  The video is clear, but it is not fun to have to reset the unit so often.  I hope I can determine what to do to correct this.I contacted the tech people at Amazon.  They determined that the unit was defective.  In one day's time I had a new unit and haven't had any problem since.  Amazon gives the best support and guarantee in the business.  I am completely satisfied with Amazon Fire.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Bill"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This unit really drove home the point of how useless a lot of what cable has to offer really is. Especially when you consider the monthly cost with all of the fees you have to pay for their service. I can watch what I want, when I want, and being a prime member is the icing on the cake. After browsing the various features of the unit, I saw that there was a lot more to it than I realized. Looking forward to really getting into it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Elliott C.

I expected that it would search all  location- ok maybe present the amazon options first. The other major problem is that it doesn't have VUDU. I have several of my digital copies on there and I can't watch them with this- very disappointing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"cvgnick\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really easy to set up and use.
