Worse, does not work with Google Photos app on either Android or Chromebook, in spite of Google assertions to the contrary.  By navigating through the increasingly confusing welter of Google image-related sites and apps one can cast some photos (from Google+, under certain conditions) but not from the much hyped new release of the Photos app, at least not from my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.  I would give it 1 star except that it works fine with Netflix; but I already have many other options for watching Netflix (Roku, DVD, smart TV, Chromebook, etc.)I have returned the Chromecast to Amazon and will not be buying another one until the WatchESPN and Google Photo app issues are resolved.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "william spurlin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love every minute of this item.
