[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great addition to our home entertainment. I have an older Panasonic TV with only two HDMI ports. Recently we bought an Onkyo receiver TX-NR636 with multiple HDMI ports. I have Dish DVR connected directly to the TV and the other port comes from the Onkyo. Without even turning on the Onkyo, I plugged in the Chromecast into the CBL/SAT port on the Onkyo and turned on the TV. It instantly came up on the TV and connected. I downloaded the App to my ipads and phone and were streaming movies to the TV within 20 minutes. Couldn't have gone any smoother. It streams flawlessly with DSL and have not had any issues other than finding halfway decent movies to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "RVator"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was given to me after a friend bought it for themselves to use at my house, and then decided we just both needed our own!  I used to use my Xbox 360 to stream from Prime and Netflix, but since my XBox has been on its last legs, this has become increasingly difficult.  Within 8-10 minutes of un-boxing the Chromecast, we were streaming again!  All you have to do it go to the website, install the app, and then you go to whatever platform (Netflix, for example) from your phone, laptop, tablet, computer, or whatever device, and click the little button to cast. It REALLY is that easy!  My XBox was noisy, but this is SILENT, and I have noticed it's actually better on overall volume than the Xbox, too.  You can control the volume of the unit itself AND the TV or whatever you're streaming to, so you've got more room to bump up the output.  This was a problem with the XBox not only because the XBox itself was loud, but because I felt like we were always jacking the volume WAY up on the TV just to make it audible.  The size makes it easy to take on trips so you can cast in the car and leave the DVD's at home.  The easy power adapter means you can use it just about anywhere you can charge a phone or other mobile device, too.  It really is simple AND simply awesome!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Starry-Eyed Mama \"Starry-Eyed Mama\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you know that it does not intend to be an Apple TV, you will be 100% satisfied.
