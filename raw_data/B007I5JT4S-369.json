I can now stream my desktop to my HDTV, and with audio to boot.  Hard to find concerts, no problem.  Search YouTube for a good source, stream away.  Instead of paying hundreds of dollars on seemingly authentic DVDs, just find an online source, mirror the desktop and viola, perfect entertainment.  Of course, it works projecting audio only too.  Some of the apps are useless to me because they are already on my TV or Blu-ray player.  Another toy, yes.  But, this one is a keeper.  Oh yeah, my Western Digital box is in the drawer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Harold"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is an amazing product that gives you access to HBO GO, Netflix, Hulu and several other options.

Even when we paid for a U.S. VPN number, changed the DSN I.P., those items still didn\u2019t work.  Hopefully it will live up to the hype once we return to the states.  I also bought the Roku 3, and it advertise to contain 2x more channels then Apple, but of course being on a European economy, we where only able to receive channels I have never heard of and none of them were Hulu, Netflix and or Disney...the main reason people purchase these devices.
