I have gotten more!  Of course you can't get the HBO and any other channel where one needs a cable TV provider but there are at least 4 others like Netflix and prime that I can get movies and or TV shows.  And I have not checked them all yet.  I am very pleased with this item and I would recommend it.  It was easy to install and set up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cheri"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The fire stick is great, I give it a 3 star rating because the main reason I wanted it is for its ability to search between many apps, however after using I realize it does search hulu and a few others, but not netflix. Also, I was disappointed to realize the device is recommended used with a power source. It appeared to only need to be plugged into the tv, but it is recommended to be plugged into a power source as well. Lastly, while netflix, hulu and amazon stream fine, I've noticed the news apps buffer a ridiculous amount. The image is beautiful and buttons are simple. I also like the phone app for voice search, if only the search would include netflix as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Patterson \"Patterson\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent!!

I am still discovering the many features and attributes but overall I am overwhelmed by the ease of use and the remarkable options it provides.  I love that I can go to Amazon Prime on-line - look up a title and add it to my watchlist immediately - very cool. An excellent value at a very reasonable cost.
