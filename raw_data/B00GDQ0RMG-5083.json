[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "Wish I could say 2.5. This is not what I expected. I read the reviews about having to plug it in to the wall and I agree it is not a plus. My t.v. Is mounted on wall, all our other cords are hidden except this one. Now I have a black cord hanging down my wall. I would hide it with the others but I would like to use the fire stick on my other t.v. My other complaint is that the print is way to small on the screen at net flicks and Amazon streaming sites. I have 20/20 vision and a 40 inch t.v and can barley read titles or instructions. I will keep it because it was 40$ and I can use it on multiple tv's. I would look into a different product and spend a little more if I where to do it again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LB working mom/ wife"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I have a Roku box now and thought I would try the stick for comparison on another TV in our home that doesn't get cable.

We used the included power adapter hooked up to the HDMI stick (a much needed third piece that the current picture of the remote and the stick does not depict). A short adapter was also included, so the stick does not have to be directly sticking out of the tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Frank \"silverdew7\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A good and inexpensive Netflix / Prime set-top-box dongle. For some reason, it won't use 1080p on my TV (Vizio), defaulting to 720p, and I had some network stuttering issues on the first day (which didn't occur on my other devices). The Netflix App's performance feels a little slower than my Gen2 AppleTV which died, but a little faster than Netflix on the XBox360. For the price, it's more than acceptable though.Setup was a breeze, except they force you to watch the intro video. The controller is quite ergonomic. Definitely consider this as a secondary / travel set top box. For now I'm using it as my primary, but I can see myself wanting to trade up (perhaps if there is a new AppleTV, or eventually to the big FireTV box).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bluechip"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely love it!!!We have 3 Blu-Ray players with streaming media. They pale in comparison to the Fire TV Stick!

Easy to set up, works very well. The normal price is good, and the Prime promotional introductory price of $19 was a real deal. My only objection is Amazon's choice of omitting Vudu from the available apps, since I have a large collection of movies that I have bought and stored in the cloud in my UltraViolet account and have been accessing them through Vudu on my Roku players. Fortunately. as other reviewers have pointed out, there are work-arounds. I have now linked my UV account to CinemaNow (available on my BluRay player) and Flixster (available on the Fire Stick). The picture quality of Flixster is the worst of the three, but it's acceptable.I have tried ChromeCast (OK, but a little awkward) and Roku Stick (never did get it to work and returned it), and the Fire Stick works much better for me. If Vudu were available on the Fire Stick, this review would have a raving 5 star rating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Ruhl"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Netflix app seems to struggle on this (rebuffering much more than any other device I have used).
