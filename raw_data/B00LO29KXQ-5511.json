[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "It makes my HDTV act like a Smart TV. I will like it much better when I purchase my new Kindle tablet and can use the second screen function. For now I am just using it with my Prime account to watch movies. It is super easy to use. The grand children think it is awesome. My kindle tablet is one of the 1st generation Kindle Fire HD models with an HDMI output so I cannot fling to a TV. When I Amazon offers an 10' HDX with 32GB or 64GB at the price I want to pay then I will have everything. It is nice to use the Fire TV Stick and a 19\" HDTV on my boat to watch movies at the Lake. I use a 4G Hotspot for Wi-Fi. We are soon going to try using this set-up while traveling in our van to keep the kids entertained.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dave Barbara"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very useful device when you have an Amazon Prime membership. It's also very small and you can't see it behind the TV at all. Many numerous features we haven't even scratched the surface of using. Overall very happy with this purchase. It's been much more useful than the Google Chrome I purchased a year ago.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric English"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Guess room doesnt have cable.

Make sure you first have an amazon account so you can sign in.Make sure you have a wireless router as this has to hook and works with wireless. I bought two of these, one for me and one for my mom. She does not have a wireless Linksys so I had to buy one of those for her (in addition to the fire stick).Also make sure you have an HDMI port in your TV. Okay, duh ...We all like this fire stick and can't imagine that we waited this long to get it. The movies are great and I like the fact that I can put something I am watching on hold and come back at a later time to see the rest without losing my place.I recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Soapy \"Soapy\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great little box.

Streaming and quality is flawless even three floors away from my cranky wireless router. And the ease of setup! So awesome to have something that works immediately and so well the very first time out of the box. Bravo, Amazon. Now, please improve the remote just a bit by adding bumps or something on the buttons so I know what I'm doing in the dark. Or lights. Customizable illumination in the remote would be rad. And more video included with Prime...And maybe an app to view Amazon order progress and tracking...word.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christopher Collins"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "For the price, you can't beat it.
