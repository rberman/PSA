I would highly recommend this product.  If there are any complaints it would be 1).  Volume is different while watching shows, especially apps.  2)  When trying to install apps (youtube, pbskids, etc.) you can't search for it in the \"app\" section.  You can find them by doing a search in the \"search\" field.  Took me a while to figure it out, but now that I know, it's really not much of a complaint, just wanted to save you the 15 minutes of frustration so you can rate this product 5 stars too!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jiowa832"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Katie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "we use it on our secondary TV and LOVE it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LindsayHS"}]
