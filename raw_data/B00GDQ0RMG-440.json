I bought this for an old TV when the Roku finally gave out after years of service.There are lots of great reviews here so I won't duplicate all the details about what channels you get. My favorite features: - Amazons programs in the email address for your account so you can immediately start watching/buying movies once you connect to your wifi (which went smoothly). - Voice recognition is excellent. Before you buy the voice-enabled remote check to see if the app works on your cell phone (phone must have an IR blaster). You don't have to search all the channels for a specific video. Just say the name of the movie/show and it shows you what services (Amazon, Netflix, etc.) are offering it at that moment.These little features save a lot of frustration and time - good job Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NHShopper"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.
