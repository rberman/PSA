The ATV gets very little use because it's hard to navigate and the remote is finicky in my opinion.  The FTV is MUCH better. The remote for the FTV is great, easy to use, and is easy to navigate in the dark which is how I watch usually.As a prime member, I love having the prime content readily available, and the newly integrated 1TB photo storage is great!  Easy to use and navigate.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I haven't yet found an easy way to display only the free/Prim content.  That would be a nice filter.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gexbert"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this.
