[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I'm disappointed in the Fire TV Stick. It works great and I have no complaints in that regard.  But as an owner of four Rokus and an Apple TV, I find the screens much more cluttered.  I honestly would prefer less promotion of movies and TV shows in my face on the home screen.  If I want hints on what to watch, just give me one space below the home screen to get those.  I also don't like the scrolling across long rows of apps.  I much prefer the grid layout of the Roku and Apple TV.  Roku abandoned the scrolling interface quite awhile ago.  I felt I was moving backwards as regards the interface.I haven't used the games much yet, but I suspect my sons will enjoy those apps.In sum, the device works great right out the box, but the interface is atrocious and needs a lot of work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Gregory K.

It was super easy to install and works just as described.  Previously, I had ordred Chromcast and it didn't work on my tv because it is an older model plasma that isn't a \"smart tv\".  I took a chance on the Fire Stick and I was delighted when it worked.  It literally took 5 minutes for me to set this up and have it running on my tv.  I love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "not a fan of the interface.. Roku is much faster to navigate despite the processor being slower..  Fire compensates for the faster processor with having to go through around 2-3 more steps to achieve what roku does.  Unplugged it and will use it on an extra device or use it as a bookmark.  This also gets hot.. really hot.  I made the mistake of having it too close to my roku stick and it made the roku glitch from the heat (which is how I noticed it).  having to have external power rather than taking advantage of mhl seems like a step back also.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "gabriel hebert"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I'd like to say I rarely ever write reviews, but everyone needs to buy a Fire Stick asap!!! I pre-ordered 2 of them a month ago at the unbeatable price of $19/stick, and it is nothing short of AWESOME.The setup was a breeze, and I've had no streaming problems thus far. Great job Amazon!!!My only complaint is that they're on backorder until January!!!

Every now and then, the remote gets stuck in a selection direction, but unlike when I first go the device, it now resolves the issue without requiring a restart. The 'remote software' for iPhone and Android doesn't allow direct typing which is a disappointment.You can tell they're heading in the right direction over a couple months though.It's definitely usable now.Improved to 3 stars.(Original Dec. 2014) Almost entirely useless. The firmware is slow and cumbersome. Locked up a couple times in my first use. When I switched back to my Chromecast in the same location, everything was quick and responsive.I have to imagine these are early kinks in the firmware and will be fixed over time.Right now, it just isn't worth plugging in or owning in its present state.1 Star", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "B.

Very disappointed as mirrorcast is supported in Win8.1 and an industry standard.  You would think that it would work. It tries to connect and appears to and then the stick just kicks back out to the Display settings.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Ashley Hoag"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "overall works really well and for the prime pre-order deal of $20, it's a no brainer!.
