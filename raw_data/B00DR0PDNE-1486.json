The app on your android phone has to be able to work with the chromcast in order to mirror your android phone on the tv. Many apps on an android phone don't work with it. My son has a Sony Xperia Z2. He has a particular movie app whereby he gets to see many movies. We thought the chromcast would have been able to allow us to see the movie from the phone, on our tv. No. You can see you tube stuff and other Google approved stuff. Truly not what I thought it would do. Nowhere does it say that it streams particular apps. Bleh!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "Nirmala Dindial \"Amazon shopper maniac\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For the price, this can't be beat.  It's really easy to set up, seriously, anyone can do this.  A lot of the apps I'm already using (HBO GO, Pandora, etc.) are supported by Chromecast.  It works really well with YouTube and GooglePlay, but if you try to play Amazon Instant Video just through the Chrome plug-in, it's pretty choppy.  That would be my only con.
