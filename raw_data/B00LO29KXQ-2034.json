Set-up was a breeze and didn't take very long for me because I already had my Netflix and Hulu accounts.  I am very happy with this purchase.  I was a little hesitant based on some of the reviews but so far so good with this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jenny Gray"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The stick is great for watching free stuff, such as old HBO series and some movies. Unfortunately, Amazon did not say that it requires a newer HDMI port. After 45 minutes on the phone with an exceptionally helpful Amazon tech, she determined that the stick was not supposed to work with my four year old TV b/c the HDMI ports were not new enough. The stick does work, however, it causes interference with regular channels - the options...send it back for a refund or keep it and only plug into the TV when we want to use it. We are keeping it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JR"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David Giocolo"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Installation was so quick and easy.
