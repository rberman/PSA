My chromecast never has a problem with the network dropping out, even though it is in the same location behind my tv as the amazon stick.The interface is confusing and difficult to find things to watch, even if you know what you want. Netflix experience is great until the network drops, at which point I need to do a hard reset and remove the power.Biggest annoyance is that you cant turn it off unless you unplug the power source. The stick eventually falls asleep (screen goes black).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Billy-Bob"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Fire TV Stick is a great concept. I personally had some challenges connecting up with my TV and local Cable set-up but that's not a Fire Stick problem but a matter of so many remotes to juggle switching back and forth from cable to amazon movies. in the Fire TV Stick package the greatest was the physical difficulty of opening the remote to add batteries. I found the case release required a lot of carefully applied pressure to get a release. It shouldn't be forced or pried open but I've certainly seen better designed release mechanisms that require batteries. Once you get past these challenges for your unique set up, the actual movie experience layout is quite nice and you can start watching films.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lewis Baker \"Lewis Baker\""}]
