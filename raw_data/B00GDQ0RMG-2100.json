One problem though.  The night I tried to install it, it wouldn't work and so I called the help line.  I could barely understand the guy who answered and he couldn't understand me to well and he told me I had to be clearer.  I got very frustrated and gave up.  A week later I figured it out by myself.  It has been great as I am really sick of cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karla Hamilton"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works as described, however I could not get it to connect to my wireless network while not broadcasting my SSID. I had to broadcast my Network SSID before it would connect. Not a big deal, I just prefer to not advertise my network (although secured) to everyone in the neighborhood. This is the first device I have run into that is unable to connect to a network that is not broadcasted.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shawn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is awesome!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stacey Jones"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We installed this into our kids room after we cut off our cable.
