It became so frustrating that we went back to our old ROKU which worked perfectly with no issues.  The Firesticke control is superb, but lack of memory is a deal killer.  Watching a two hour movie takes four hours because it starts and stops.  Don't buy until this is fixed!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J.
