Later I found several apps on android and  PC (plugins for chrome browser) which seamlessly cast any video.  This is the best option for web videos.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Raj S"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product!  If you don't have a Smart TV this will allow you to use go to Netflix or other similar sites without plugging the computer up to your TV.  Even if you have a Smart TV (like we do) it is very useful.  We have movies saved to our hard drive and used to have to plug the TV up to the computer to play them.  Then if we wanted to pause or rewind we would have to go over to the computer and then the popups were a whole other problem.  This allows us to remotely play the movies from our tablet, computer, or phone.  Love it!  The price is great too.  Similar items like the Roku are much more expensive.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angela Smith"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "too slow", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Renato Reis de Macedo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "One of my best purchases ever!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Randy Gonzalez"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It is ok.
