I believe, as of now, the only apps that work with it are..1. Google play store/YouTube2. Google music3. Netflix4. PandoraOnce Hulu is added, would be nice.

My wife uses it for Netflix, almost exclusively, and some YouTube, so I cannot opine on other channels (does it work with Amazon PrimeTime? Don't know, haven't checked). The form factor is excellent; no problem finding space for it in the back of the TV. I installed in HDMI 1, and it's just a follow-the-instructions exercise. Once operational, very fault-tolerant.
