Why they just did not leave the apps for smart TV.  They even sent a replace stick and still nothing register on the TV.  And of course you try to call or email back the person you talk to first you cannot.  You can only speak to someone who does not speak ENGLISH!!!!!

I got it this January 2015 and use for like two month, there is two things I really disappointed are, first, the content keep showing me blue screen with HDCP Unauthorized Content Disabled showed! I searched the reviews on Amazon and most of ppl have this issues and I know that the Amazon haven't send the major software updates for this big issue! The other thing is the connection of the wifi is bad for my case. I am currently using 50mpbs Comcast Internet speed and I am using my iPad to streaming movies for 1080p quality with no problem but I tried to get the smoothly movie experience on the Amazon fire TV stick but it's truns the HD movie will freeze or stop playing all the time. Even I watched the NBA on the nba league pass too. I don't think that's the problem of my internet speed or my wireless router because all other devices works fine! So that's the down side of this product makes me feel.The thing is, I dut like a product that you will feel stressful and needs to check online for the problems every time with new app or new functions when you install or try to use it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian Sobrino"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kara H."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fast, easy to use and great to be able to mirror my Kindle Fire HDX to my TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mctom"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}]
