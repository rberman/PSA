[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "This device has potential, but it would be nice to able to see the \"free\" Prime videos that Amazon has without wading through all of them. Maybe it's just my internet, but the videos are constantly buffering, and they don't play through like on my Apple TV. For now, I think I will stick to my Apple TV. I love that thing. If Apple had the Prime Instant Video it would be unstoppable. Since I have both, I would highly look into an Apple TV if you are going to be a cord cutter. Hopefully, Amazon updates the UI in the future to be able to go straight to the free videos.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ryan Lee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Shawn"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Looking at the specs I'm sure these will be a perfect gift for my parents who watch Netflix and want to do it without hooking up a PC to their TV.

Only thing I didn't like was the process of setting up the netflix app being that there were no directions on doing so.

All are good in there own little ways but for the price of $19.99, Im most pleased with the fire stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Huey Le"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fire TV Stick Arrived just in time for Thanksgiving family get together.  Super easy to instal and connect to my wifi network.  Lots of free content from Amazon because I am a prime member.  However in the games, the FreeCell sucks, does not allow some moves.  But I did not get the Fire TV Stick for FreeCell and the rest works intuitively.
