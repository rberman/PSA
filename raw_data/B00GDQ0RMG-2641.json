I hardly ever use it now and feel like it was a complete and total waste of money. I thought maybe it was my connection because I was upstairs but when I use my iPad or phone to try and watch Netflix or hulu from the same room where my firestick is, they work perfectly but the fire stick doesn't.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Maddy Anderson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic! Easy set-up and a must have if you are a prime member. Being able to mirror my HDX 7 on my big screen is unbelievably useful and the portability is also a huge plus.

I had it set up in less than 15 minutes and I think this included watching the tutorial.  Kids are already watching a movie.  I will probably buy another one to go on the other TV since it is a pain to go through the Wii.

I was really anticipating D day, was actually excited. Then it comes, I use it to watch shows on Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Instant Video... ect, and what I'm watching freezes up more than a dusty VCR tape. I know my internet speed isn't the problem because it clocks at an average of 80 MBPS and none of my other devices have this issue (not even the Chrome Cast I almost threw away).
