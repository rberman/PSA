I don't have cable but have an amazon prime and nextflix account, and this makes it easy for me to watch shows and movies from my TV.  It runs pretty smoothly and I haven't had any trouble with shows freezing or slow speeds while I'm watching. There's also lots of  channels you can upload directly from the Amazon website. The price is also pretty good and comparable/cheaper to other options such as the Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lena"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product, with one down side the wifi signal gets lost and the only way to correct it is to reboot the device.
