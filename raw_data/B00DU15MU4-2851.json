I don't watch t.v. , however I am a video game tester and electronics junkie ! I own almost every cool piece of gaming tech out there from a to z .... The fire t.v. plays most games very well , the GPU which is in the fire TV is the adreno 320, it runs most modern apps and games fluently but struggles on higher demanding titles like dead trigger 2. The fire TV does not have allot of games as of now, but the list grows every week or so. The amazon controller is okay but not worth the money , i use the moga power pro. The bottom line is ,  It's all about what you like. TV junkies will like this device and all the content it has to offer, I like playing Modern Combat 4 on my 40 inch Samsung and like that I can stick the fire TV in my pocket if i travel .... what do you like ?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jason"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I would have given this item a 5 star rating had the documentation been better.  Unlike most devices, there is apparently, no 'on' and 'off' switch.  Selecting sources of enterntainment and selecting something to watch, again some documentation would be nice.  It works pretty darn good, though.  I had it plugged in and working within 5 minutes.
