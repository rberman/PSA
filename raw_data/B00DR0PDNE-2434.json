My non-techie husband, who still has a flip phone from 2003, thought Netflix was too hard to use. So, one day while he was out of the house, I installed Chromecast (FREE Shipping!!!) on his office tv. I plugged it into the HDMI port, turned on his laptop (no password. oy!), went the the Chromecast web address, and had everything set up in a few clicks.The Chromecast dongle (that's a word) plugs into a USB or HDMI port on your tv. It also needs to be plugged in ... either to the USB in your tv or an AC outlet. You'll have to switch the input on your tv (ours was HDMI2) to see the display and setup instructions. Chromecast connects to your home wifi (HEY!! You need home wifi for this thing to work!) and you give it a name (like \"Dad's office\"). You then download the Chromecast app, which finds your new device, and allows you to install the Cast extension -- a little icon in the corner of your Chrome browser. When you open Chrome and click the Cast icon, you simply select the device you'd like to cast to, and anything in your browser is now on your tv! Netflix, Youtube, HBO GO, Hulu Plus, Pandora, Google Play, VEVO, and more are now on the big screen! You can also download Chromecast for iOS (iPhone and iPad) or Android.Now, to watch Netflix, we change the tv to HDMI2, open Google Chrome (that has the homepage set to Netflix), and it is movie time! We've had Chromecast for a few weeks and the hubby just figured out yesterday he could watch *anything* in the Chrome browser. Online sports! Youtube! Google Maps! Even his email. And that's when I decided I need one too. Instead of staring at my computer screen for email, chat boards, and Facebook (not to mention Netflix), I could be lounging in the comfy chair, watching the 42\".Amazon has free shipping and is priced $5 cheaper than ordering directly from Google. Heck, we spent almost $30 on fast food for dinner yesterday.
