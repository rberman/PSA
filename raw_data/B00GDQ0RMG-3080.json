[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "Wow I wish I loved this as much as I liked its easy installation. The menu is EXTREMELY misleading if you want to watch Netflix...even if you've been watching something on Netflix during a prior viewing you end up on amazon prime instead. I can't count the number of mis-starts where we had to go back and load Netflix first. Also fairly frequent interruptions in streaming despite a new state of the art router.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "spankylover"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Giving it only 3 stars because I had to call in for help because it would loose wifi over and over. Called support and they helped me fix it. Turns out these pick up alot of interference from the TV which makes it drop wifi. Wierd for a device made to plug directly into your TV's HDMI slot. I ended up using a tube from empty roll of paper towels along with the the 4inch extension it comes with to move it away from the TV some. Now it works just dont look behind my TV lol.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought the Fire Stick to try it out and was pleasantly surprised.
