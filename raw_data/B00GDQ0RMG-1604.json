[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I ordered the Fire TV Stick in January 2015, the return window closed in March.  In May I started experiencing problems with the video and audio going out of sync.  This progressed until it was almost impossible to watch any show on Netflix.  Then in July, it started to bump me out of Netflix altogether.  It would seem this is a global issue with the Fire Stick and Netflix.  Sadly, It is no longer returnable.  After calling Customer Service I was instructed to do a factory reset and will end up losing all settings I've loaded on the device.  Very frustrating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kate"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Exciting Technology for a couple of non-techno adults.

Highly compressed and lots of dropped frames. Disappointing. I activated my Prime account on my TiVo (which is also connected wireless) and the quality was very good. Not sure why, the the Fire TV Stick just looks awful. The interface is nice and easy to navigate. If the streaming quality were as good, I'd be able to recommend this.
