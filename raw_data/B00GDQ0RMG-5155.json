Nice finish. I have my kids watch youtube cartoon on TV. Clear. Switch between program easy. Compare to Chrom TV stick at $34.

I was able to get it when it was on sale for $19 and it's the best $19 dollars I have ever spent. I can stream my Prime Instant Videos, Amazon digital movies I have purchased, Twitch, and Netflix. You can listen to the music you purchased on Amazon and some of the songs even have lyrics if you want to sing along or do karaoke. There are a lot of fun apps you can download and the video quality is great.The remote works quickly and doesn't take up a lot of space. I recommend downloading the smartphone app which allows for voice searching. The app makes searching easier than trying to click through each letter. The stick also comes with an extension if your TV's HDMI ports are in hard to reach spots.I read the HBO GO app will be available soon which makes this stick even better.The only bad thing about the Fire TV Stick is that if your ISP has a cap on your internet usage you might go over it because you'll want to use this all the time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Addicted Shopper"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!!

None of my laptops, which are Miracast certified are able to connect.  I have since learned, that Amazon has consciously omitted support for MS Windows devices.  (very disappointing as this was my primary reason to buy this device)Otherwise, for $20, it has worked well to date.UPDATE: Since buying the Fire Stick TV, they have now included \"Windows 8.1 compatibility coming soon\".
