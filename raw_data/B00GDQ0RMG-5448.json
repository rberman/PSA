The remote never found the setup.  The setup never showed up on my TV with on-screen instructions.  Read all the \"help\" on in the PDF manual online but still nothing on my TV.  Tried both the direct USB connect and the HDMI connect but made no difference.  Don't know what is wrong but this device just is not working for me.  I expected an easy, problem-free, and simple setup but did not get it so the device is repackaged and just waiting for some insight.Don't know what else to try and attempting to \"pair\" with my Fire Phone is just not an option to complicate problems I am already having with my Fire Phone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got it half price and I love it.
