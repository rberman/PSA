Despite all of the publicity about the huge number of films available to prime members, most films are not free.

We contacted Amazon customer service, they were great and made everything right... we received a replacement in 2 days and the second one has worked wonderfully. The interface is much better than the system that came included on our TV (it's a Vizio). It's very easy to navigate and search different shows. I also love the ability to access our own videos and music.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Kimaloo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "BEST INVESTMENT MADE I CUT MY CABEL BILL DONT NEED ANYTHING ELSE", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "RAMON"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Was better than what i expected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Deloris"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Well worth the money.
