[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am LOVING this thing. A very portable version of FireTV. The streamin' ability and quality is spot on for Netflix and Prime video. I have an LED tv and I think this device brought out the real capability of this new technology (new for me anyway...i thought HD was the latest lol) Not only visual quality but the audio is outstandin'. I look forward to them addin' more apps to this, and the other device that i soon hope to own. The only thing as a customer tryin' to figure out which one of these to get needs to think about is: do i need the portability of a FireTV Stick, or do i need somethin' with abit more storage space and slightly beefier hardware inside that can be a more permanent fixture at home? As that is the only difference between the devices that i can tell from the descriptions and havin' only experienced this one and not the other yet. The only caveat is that i feel that amazon should dedicate more time into the amount of apps (as well as quality i.e. brands to bring on board) as well as more quality game apps....Google Play store still dominates on the games variety and i hope that'll change (unless i'm not seein' the full selection by my own error/ignorance or for the fact that this stick has just launched outta the box) To sum this all up: this is a great gift that's quick, easy, and worth the price they ask. Even if you think it isn't right now...remember that these devices will always be updated/expanded with time. All i know is that it's a fact NOW, that i have been turnin' off my xbox for streamin' apps finally and find myself immediately on this thing. There's no hesitation switchin' from one app to another, and it saves your place in each with episodic television. A great gift for any occasion. Very glad i snagged 2 of them at $19/a piece durin' the first 24 hours after they announced it and offered it to Prime members at that. It's made my investment in Amazon all the better for it :D", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "10/11", "author": "StarbuckUnited \"I love sci-fi/fantasy and mysteries and am open minded on what seems like a good read.

I also really like the Interface and Menu layout, I believe it to be better than that of Apple TV and Google TV products. It actually has many more Apps, Games and personal option's than both the Apple TV and Google TV. It even has the Air Play/ DLNA feature for connectivity to my other devices, I.E., phone, tablet, etc...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D. J.

It does get pretty warm and the D-pad on the remote was causing it to go haywire one time, another it was just frozen and doing things at random.  Removing the batteries in the remote did not help.
