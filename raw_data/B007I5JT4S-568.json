It's a all in one super machine for your apple devices. Just one click and its on the tv screen.Cons: I have an iPhone 4 and iPad 2 so it limits some of the display options.

Some people want the Apple TV 2 because of Jail breaking. I don't know. This is 1080P the 2 is 720. Only other channel I wanted to watch was HBO GO so I got a ROKU XS. Same thing as Jail-breaking an Apple 2 but its 1080P so is the Apple 3 and a lot less money that a Jail broke Apple TV 2 Plus,if you screw up and get your Apple TV 2 updated, you lose your Jail Break. This is a great product. Oh the updating over wifi would not work. Failed on all three. Found a Mini USB from an old cell phone and plugged it into my computer, Opened iTunes, update screen popped up and in 5 minutes had the latest firmware.I would buy this over the Apple V 2 even if they were the same price. Great picture! Great audio, Air play, Blue Tooth, everything I need!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark Schuster \"m6255\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this thing.

As the owner of several Roku streaming devices we are used to being able to add our favorite channels for streaming.  These channels include Amazon Prime, which is not available on Apple TV.

I can say with a soul untouched by marketing ghouls or any partiality developed by product loyalty over the years, that this item has changed the course of my life. This product has the ability to take any mundane, boring life, and make it analogous to being Crocket in Miami Vice as you drive along a hot Miami freeway at night with the top down. This product is the air I breathe, the warm touch of sun on my skin, the look of love reflected in a child\u2019s eyes. If I was ever trapped in a layer of the space time continuum with no hope of escape, and could only have one item to spend the rest of time with, it would be this item. I attempted to take a picture showing me with this item, but so much of my pure essence is focused on enjoying this item that I no longer reflect light as a normal person and can no longer be seen in a standard photograph. I would say more, but that would take time away from using my item, and I physically cannot handle that\u2026..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Timothy Mattingly"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We are super happy with our Apple TV. We use it in the bedroom to watch the occasional Netflix, etc. We were plugging iPad into TV with a 10 ft HDMI cord before and that was a pain in the butt!Apple TV is super easy to use and took less than 5 min to set up.

To add music to what's playing is useless.  If you don't build playlists or play by category like genre, artists etc., you really can't build a current play list or \"now playing\" and have mush control over it.There are probably better appliances out there for a little less money, but over all, I'm pretty happy with this.
