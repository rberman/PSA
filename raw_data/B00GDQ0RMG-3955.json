My Roku works fine, but even though the wireless router is closer to my son's room, the Roku would lag so bad that he just stopped using it.  I got the Fire TV stick to see if it would work for him better.  He loves it.  It brings up video right away and I no longer have to hear him complain!  Great buy!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"dipstop\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "works great! The device itself works great and I like the interface.  The picture quality is great and most of the apps are great and I look forward to trying more.  The espn app is particularly disappointing though because you have to already be paying for cable and have espn for it to work which defeats the purpose.  I was hoping to get rid of cable and thinking the espn app would make that more doable for me but I digress.  lots of cool features and great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alec Regalado"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing and easy to use it! But Missing are Vudu but I know HBO Go will coming on Mid-2015 for Fire Stick...My opinion about subtitles and caption are ok because Does not support subtitles in Flixster app and very few app but no problem with Amazon Instant Video and support subtitles, too! Sling is the first time on Amazon Fire Stick that was so great HD picture, nice channels and extra cartoons, sports, or news/cooking and of course support is closed-caption! I wish this need add app a little more like, Vudu and DisneyMoviesAnywhere *not WATCHDisney*. Amazon Games app are enjoy to play it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "beeyobee \"BeeyoBee\""}]
