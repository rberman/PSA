Setup was simple: Downloaded the chromecast app to my phone, connected it with the ChromeCast, and input my information. Setup time was only 2 minutes total. After that, I was able to stream Google Music, Movies, Netflix and Youtube all to my TV. For $35, you really can't go wrong with this.The selection of apps that work with it is quite limited for the time being, but developers are already doing great things with it so the app base should expand in no time.

The amount of apps that are currently available to use with the chromecast is very limited, (Netflix, YouTube, and Play Movies) but I see big things for it in the future. Also the clarity is amazing.  It puts out full HD (1080p) for Netflix, on my blu ray player Netflix is only outputting 720p.  YouTube it varies of the quality of the video but still nice its nice to just put the video you want to watch quick on your tv.  Set up is really simple the device for the most part does all the work.  I haven\u2019t rented a movie from Google play yet but I may in the future.

And when I say set up I plugged it in and it told me to go to a website.  I went to the website and put in the code that was on my TV.  Then, without any effort on our part both Kindles, three Cellphones and one IPad all had little Icons added to YouTube and Netflix to start a \"Cast\" to our TV.  Our kids already knew how to get to Netflix on the kindle and I just showed them where the cast icon was and it went straight to the TV.  Netflix and YouTube both work perfectly.  However, HBOGO while in the chrome browser had some lag and the sound got out of sync.  Of course HBOGO doesn't have the app for it yet so hopefully that comes in the future.AMAZING product.
