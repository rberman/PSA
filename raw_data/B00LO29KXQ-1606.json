However I notice even through the performance speed is okay, it doesn't have all the apps that roku seems to have. I love my kdrama and fire stick doesn't support Drama Fever and a few more apps I've came to love.  :(  I've had this almost a year now and have decided to go back to Roku. Fire Stick isn't that bad though, you can side load android aps (only a few will work right), the miracast isn't bad but it does get sluggish a lot. And I guess the best part would be fire stick is centralized around your amazon prime account so you can pull your videos and music up fairly quickly. The overall interface of fire stick leaves something to be desired though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "N. R.
