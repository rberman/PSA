Each have their strengths.  The Fire TV Stick provides the best interface into your Amazon content.  However, by optimizing the experience for Amazon content, I find it has made access to non-Amazon content to be a non-optimal experience.  It's easier and faster to use the Roku for content like Netflix, Youtube, Pandora, etc...  So if you plan to spend most of your time accessing Amazon content, go for the Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven E."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good buy for prime users to make a dumb TV smart", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul Simanauskas \"I shall name thee \"Stabatha\"\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I never had any problem with Chrome Cast I only switched to Fire Stick to view Prime movies.
