Have controlled those apps from a Windows 8 PC, Ipad and Iphone 4 with no issues.Looking forward to more apps being supported.My only gripe is with videos dropped into a chrome browser and cast from there. Works fine initially but often casting will fail after 20 / 30 minutes. Return to the browser and no devices are detectible for casting. Sometimes closing the browser are reopening it fixes it, some times it doesn't. Happens often enough that casting from the chrome browser is really not usable,.Have not been able to find any information on this issue on the Chromecast support pages.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Mel Mullarkey"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Only works on 2.4Ghz frequency.

It seems to have its limitations given the form factor, but otherwise it's night and day between this device and the streaming options that come with (older)blu-ray players and smart TVs.  It helps to have a tablet to run the Chromecast app, but configuring and controlling a Chromecast device is possible with a laptop or desktop computer provided your computer has a wireless adapter.  Searching for Netflix movies and youtube videos is a breeze as you no longer have to use a TV or blu-ray player remote to navigate around.  Video and audio quality are what you'd expect when it comes to streaming and the initial setup is straightforward and simple enough that most people should be able to easily set one of these devices up.  It does have a few faults, namely setup can be clunky when not using the Chromecast APP via a tablet device or smart phone.  Apparently, it's much more difficult to connect a Chromecast device to a wireless  network that isn't broadcasting its SSID or flat out impossible.  The Chromecast player doesn't seem to be able to handle really complex scenes (video playback becomes choppy, audio sync is lost).  Examples of this are scenes from the first (or one of) Walking Dead episode for season 3 where the actors are walking between chain link fences.  This scene would grind to a crawl as my Chromecast player struggled to keep up losing audio sync and pausing momentarily every other second.  One of the last scenes from Evil Dead 2 caused the same behavior as the flashing lights, wild camera movement and props moving all over the screen were too much for this little streaming device to handle.. which is a shame since my LG blu-ray player has never had this issue, but I'm guessing it (the LG) has some dedicated decoding hardware that the Google Chromecast may lack ( I don't know what's \"under the hood\" of this device or my LG player).Pros:Low costSize (it's small enough to hide away behind your TV or AVR)Easy enough setup and video / movie selectionControlled via a tablet, phone, or PC/laptopDoesn't require LOS between whatever device you're using to control it and the Chromecast itself.Cons:Seems to require a tablet/smartphone for the best user experience, ease of setupWill start broadcasting out wirelessly when it loses connection with your router (has to since it has no USB/network ports and no other way to reconfigure it)Seems to lack processing power for complex/busy movie scenes resulting in dropped frames, hitching, loss of audio syncContent sources are a bit limited right now, but this can change quickly as more online streaming sites add Chromecast supportDoes not include the ability to stream in content from a local DNLA server (think FreeNAS)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This device made it possible to stream youtube wirelessly from our android phones, tablets, ipad.
