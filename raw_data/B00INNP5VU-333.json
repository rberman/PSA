The app selection and video players work well on it.  The loading time is a little slow, but that's what you get when buying the stick rather than the larger player with more speed and power.  The reason I am giving a one star is because of the company.  I called to get some help on my stick because it was resetting constantly.  I was immediately given a sales pitch to buy the extended warranty because I am a \"premium\" customer.  It was $19.99.  The guy on the phone wouldn't help me unless I paid this or a one time $10 fee for his service.  All of this because my warranty was out by 18 days.  I paid it, because it was cheaper than buying another streaming device.  Once I paid he then helped me.  And by doing something minor that I wouldn't have thought of, he fixed it.  All this is to say, if you are fine with paying $20 for customer service for the next 2 years then do so, otherwise I feel like I would go with another company with better ethics and customer service.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nick Bigham"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my Roku stick!
