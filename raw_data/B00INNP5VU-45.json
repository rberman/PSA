This make a great installation - nothing is visible from the front.  I have a regular Roku hooked up to another TV on the same wireless network.  This Roku stick seems to be a little slower in powering up, loading the menus and buffering the start of a show.  After the show starts I have no problems.This is powered by a USB cable.  If your TV has a USB jack near the HDMI inputs you can take the power off that.  You can get a short (6\") USB cord that makes for a much neater install than the long cord that comes with this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ronspr"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "won't fit into the port on my tv", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Maria D."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "A lot of stuff I don't need, but the things I do need work well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kelsey"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I am very satisfied with the refurbished product and glad I went this route purchased for $29.99. I saved $20 by not buying them brand new.  I haven't had any problems. As for the Roku system of channels, it's a good product.  A lot of the free movie content is VERY old movies and the same ones from one app to another. But hey, it's free and you do have something to watch.  Crackle is one where you can get some movie content that is not as old.  I purchased Sling which is an app on Roku. I really like Sling because for $20 you get 23 channels and you can add a variety of additional channel packages for $5 and it's all current TV in real time...like having cable but only channels that you probably really watch. One of the $5 packages is Epix movies (about four channels)  I pay $35 for television that we watch and movies!  It would be nice if Sling offered a few more channels in their packages though like Hallmark, TV Land, BET, Discovery, TVOne, and Sci Fi.  I have Lifetime, LMN, CNN, History and History II, A&E;, TNT, Epix movies, WE, and it has two ESPN channels.  I purchased a $6 antenna ( Mediasonic Homeworx HW110AN Super Thin Indoor HDTV Antenna)  which brings in all of my local stations and their substations like Cable has.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.

I can pay one fee for internet and watch unlimited movies from my amazon account.  So awesome.  Can also stream from my phone using the screen mirror option.  Best thing ever.
