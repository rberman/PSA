[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought my Amazon Fire TV at Best buy a couple weeks ago and I love it!!  To cut expenses I had to reallyscale back my Directv package.  I used to have the highest package and ended up rarely watching the moviechannels to the extent of what I was paying for them to be there for me to watch.I had a gift card I had been saving and was looking and this and the Roku I believe it was.  I talked to theassociate there and they said if I was a Prime Member and my main goal was to watch tv and movies thatwas covered under that then the Fire TV was right for me.  Boy she did not steer me wrong.  Simple to set upand I was watching TV.So thanks Amazon for coming out with a great TV product!!  Will be enjoying many hours of tv watching", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Karen"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Like the concept, but again Amazon drops the ball. The Fire TV eats up too much memory, so when Time Warner Cable cuts my internet download during the early morning hours I cannot use it to watch videos in my library because I have to stream them. Like the concept gehind ASAP but it eats up to memory for videos that will never be watched. Early on I had no problems but the more I use it the worse it gets. Owners should have the ability to kill ASAP if they want to. The Fire TV also runs very hot because of ASAP downloads and has to be unplugged.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Dumasclub Man"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Leans Toward Amazon During Searches Otherwise A Nice Sy7stem", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Larry Cook"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "very good tv", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Helper"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I own a Fire TV and bought it specifically for my parents with poor eye sight to use the voice search and until the voice search works with every app across everything the Fire TV offers this is a poor excuse for an Apple TV or Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Durinsbane"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great idea.
