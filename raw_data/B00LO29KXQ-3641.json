[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have a Roku, Apple TV, and now a Firestick all on the same TV. Each has its own personality. Firestick works well with Amazon movies ( not found on Apple TV). The Apps seem skittle weak compared to apps on Roku and ATV. For example The Golf Channel app on Firestick only has a dozen things to watch. No current PGA updates, only a few lessons.The remote is fast and easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "W.

It is easy, simple to use and understand. I like that it is portable. The apps that came with the TV Stick are more than what I need but having options is always good. I have not had any issues with this. No connectivity issues. Quality is awesome. Amazon has a good number of programs that I enjoy watching on prime and the ability to watch them on my TV instead of my laptop is way more enjoyable. I feel that Amazon got this one right. It is small, portable and easy to use. Apps available are perfect for MY wants and needs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install and Simple to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kiki"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Google stick price with all Apple TV functions & quality!
