Love. Love this!!! I was looking for an alternative to watching my favorite TV shows as my cable provider had increased my monthly rate to $149.94/month. Which I find outrageous for a single woman who follows the occasional show and likes to browse the internet. Amazon Fire TV was on sale for $84 when I bought it, a deal if you ask me. Buying into Amazon Prime for another $99 gives you quite a bit more features as well as the free shipping from purchases on the website, which if you ask me pays for itself. Numerous freebies as well as pay as you go options. Apps available such as Hulu and Netflix if you subscribe to watch even more for monthly fees. Set up was a breeze. The remote with the voice control is fantastic. All in all I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. Actually I have. Trying to get my parents and sibling to cancel their cable provider and switch to this. Best decision I've made in a while.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amanda S Friedburg"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "First off you need the ethernet cable, and then the HDMI, and then, if you want to use the TV and the internet at the same time, wi-fi.
