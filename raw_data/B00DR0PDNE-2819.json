[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is awesome for anyone who regularly uses Netflix or other apps to stream tv/movies. Both our tv and blu-ray player are wi-fi enabled, but they take forever to turn on, connect, and choose the apps. Since the Chromecast can be controlled either by Apple or Android hand-held devices, it's awesome. Perhaps the coolest feature is that it automatically turns on the tv and chooses the correct video source, so I no longer have to deal with 2-3 different remotes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Francophile Am\u00e9ricaine"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "it Works great, awesome product. it Works for netflix, and YouTube. the setting up it's  so easy. i recommend it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GASTON TORRES"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was lucky enough to get one of these in the first days it was offered with the Netflix promotion.  After using it for about 4 months not, I can say that I would have paid full price for it as well.  We use it for our TV in our bedroom and it's great for being able to watch a streaming show while still surfing the internet on the iPad.  It doesn't have as many features as a Roku, but for the price the features can't be beat.  A great item to put in a guest room!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Annie K."}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This thing is a useless piece of junk. It only works about half of the time and when it does work it skips and buffers like crazy. It is located about 3 feet from my router and yet is almost never detected. It has been set up properly and I get the same results from my phone, iPad, and laptop. I can't believe that google would release a product so heinous! I would rather smash it to pieces for its insolence than return it!
