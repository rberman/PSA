Let the Android or IOS apps control the media, and then direct the Chromecast to stream directly without interference (or battery drain) from the device.I've taken to listening to Pandora, Google Play Music, watching Netflix, HBO Go on the Chromecast, and I think the HD picture quality from Netflix is even better on the Chromecast than on my Samsung UN40ES6150 TV. Perhaps it's because the antenna is exposed.By itself, Google feeds this with beautiful HD still images, and a clock. The Android app now asks for rough location data, so I'm hoping -- c'mon Google! -- that I can customize my Chromecast's \"screensaver\" mode with local weather, traffic to a specific location (\"work,\" based on my Google Now cards?), etc. Just as options, mind you.You need to plug it in to a 1A USB port (not 500mA like PC USB ports) on your TV, or ... use the included charger and longer microUSB cord. A short one is provided in case your TV does have a higher power USB port.For $35 this is a great way to stream content on an HDTV that doesn't have the smart apps (or a streaming disc player, or Roku) to get. As a simple music player (Songza, Pandora, Google Play Music), the Chromecast is great.Now we just need MORE APPS to support the Chromecast...!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.B.

I love that the volume is switched to the television.  There is NO compromise of picture quality or sound.  The picture and sound are so clear that I prefer using it instead of my laptop.  The only problem with the device I have is that Java is not supported.  Therefore when I want to cast a Java encrypted animation or something or play games, it won't show up on the screen.

Only reason I gave it four stars is because I have to \"cast\" to the TV from my laptop (we don't have a smart phone) which is in another room (my office) across the house.  Yeah, I could move the laptop into the bedroom so we can pause, change shows, etc. at bedside.  However, setting up the machine on a folding tray every time we want to watch something in the master is just as inconvenient as my having to step into the office to do the same.
