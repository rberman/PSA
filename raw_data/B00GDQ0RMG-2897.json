I would get a message saying that there is no internet. I would to settings and it will tell me that it is connected to my wifi and the signal is good. When I finally get it to work and start watching something the program stops and says that the Internet is slow. It takes me two hours to watch for ten minutes. Tech support just takes me through the same steps that I take. Like I said \"It's not working for me\"!I've gone back to read the reviews. Apparently it's not working for a lot of people. Are these the people that paid $20.00? Why does it appear that it works for some people. Are these the people that paid $40.00? Could it be that the people that paid $20.00 is paying for the manufacture and/or the repair for the units that went out to the people that paid $40.00. Look at the quantity of people that gave it one star and are not returning it. How about the people that didn't bother to rate or write a review for their non working units? That's a lot of money.I DON'T KNOW! I'm not surprised by crazy business practices nowadays. What is Amazon going to do? What can we do as consumers?Who are these people that are giving it Five Stars?Are you kidding me?!!!You need to go back and tell the truth. Maybe you rated it just after it happened to have work for the first time!

This has been really worthwhile.It's about the same price as a chromecast, but much easier to use and more responsive. Plus, it has amazon (along with the normal hulu and netflix).

However, for some reason my ISP/cable provider does not support Amazon Fire TV, so no HBO. Not nearly as easy to stream from a phone (non Amazon) or tablet as chromecast. Ability to watch and access Amazon Prime content (which chromecast can't) doesn't necessarily seem worth the extra steps and less convenient functions one would find with chromecast.
