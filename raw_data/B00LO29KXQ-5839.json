Amazon has put in a lot of thought into it and it shows with movies to music.  I love playing my prime music to a slide show of pictures.One thing it lacks to my Chromcast is with the fire app, you can't cast what is on your phone right to the fire stick.  A drag, but a smaller issue to how well it does what you want.  I don't game, but it is so much better than my Apple tv or Chromcast.The remote it comes with is an rf remote not it like the Apple tv, so it is useful!Can't wait for generation 2.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ski Utah \"review dude\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just got it and works great.

Was going ti give one for a gift. Thats not happening. Im returning both. The first connection was fine and took about 10 minuted to pair and find my wifi. Im using the supplied power adapter. It paired once and has never been able to find my network connection since then. Ive tried 2 different wifi connections both with great signals and well within range. This fire stick now says it can not connect to any of my wifi. It can find my wifi but it wont connect. If it cant connect to 2 of my wifis then there is definately a problem with the fire stick. I refuse to give the other fire stick as gift because I dont want to give my friend a piece of trash for xmas. First time Ive given a bad review from anything on Amazon.

The SMPLINK (a.k.a HDMI CEC) feature of the TV/fire TV stick whereby you can use the TV's remote to control Fire TV works with the Fire TV stick with one major Flaw. For the HDMI CEC to get activated, you need to power cycle the fire TV stick every time the TV is turned OFF and the then turned back ON.So if you are watching the Fire TV and then you turn off the TV and then turn it back on again, the CEC feature stops working. To make it work again, you will need to power cycle the fire TV stick too by disconnecting the usb charging adapter of the Fire TV and connecting it back again.This is a major Flaw and Fire TV stick needs to fix this,.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kishore Karthikeyan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product!
