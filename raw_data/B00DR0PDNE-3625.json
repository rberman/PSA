Yes.Does it work with our TV?  Yes, actually it does with both of them (of course not at the same time)Is it a good value for the Price?  Yes.I'd give it an honest 4.5 star review on the product alone.  5 stars when you consider the price, and it might be 5 stars if ANY upgrades come to it (make it easier to mirror my phone on my tv directly.)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LM1000 \"LM\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Pros:- Once set up it works as advertised for a great price- Image quality is good provided you have decent wireless coverage- Superior use model to Apple's AIRPLAY for cloud based content where you initiate with synced device, but then the Chromecast takes over and directly streams the content.  For example, with Netflix you an use a tablet device to select a movie, select the Chromecast to stream, and can then turn off the tablet device or do other things with the tablet.  On an iOS device using AIRPLAY you must leave the device on as AIRPLAY is streaming from the device and for video the iOS device must be actively playing the video - in the AIRPLAY model the iOs device is streaming from the cloud based source and the AIRPLAY device is streaming from the iOS device.This direct streaming model is a VERY nice feature for Chromecast (please copy Apple) but will be more useful when more apps are available.  What makes this less useful in reality is that for cloud based content, like HBOGO or Netflix, an app can be written for AppleTV (or Roku) and selected direclty using the on-device GUI which is a better use experience anyway.Cons:Lack of a GUI makes setup and use harder than it needs to be:- Why require any secondary device to set it up?  (The Roku has the same issue which makes even less sense as the Roku has a remote and full GUI interface.)- On my network, during setup, the Chromecast claimed it could not connect even though a look at the DHCP server clearly showed the Chromecast was getting an IP address.  Google's (rather poor - online only) help was useless as it asked me to set things that were either already set or did not resolve the issue.  I finally had to DMZ the Chromecast to make the initial connection and complete configuration.  (At this point I was able to remove Chromecast from the DMZ and it worked fine for regular use.)- Really miss a proper GUI for regular use - this device is not really an alternative for a Roku or Apple TV, as one must use the synced device to find, select, control (read Pause) any content.  I find myself missing a GUI and missing a real remote even more.I eagerly ordered this device to try because as the 3 months of Netflix included meant it was less than $20 to test drive.  However, as I already own other devices (AppleTV and Roku) I have not really used the Chromecast since setting it up.  The Chromecast is simply not as slick as either the AppleTV or Roku as a media player.I think this is a great device (at a very fair price) for Android users who want the capability to show some content on TV screens (meaning an AIRPLAY like option for Android) but the Chromecast is not a great media player alternative - the Chromecast needs a GUI and remote to be really useful for media player duties.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "4/5", "author": "Amazonian \"IR\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I went thru 3 routers, belkin, linksys, and netgear....NO ONE OF THEM WOULD RECOGNIZE THE CHROMECAST DEVICE!butMy next door neighbor has a 10 year old linksys without security......and i recognized the chromecast right away.I think there is a major problem with newer routers and the customer support for all three companies is terrible.Has anyone else had this problem, do you know of a fix???", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Herb"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "From a hardware viewpoint, it is a great device.  My biggest complaint is that there is not an operators console.  There is no way to control who can send items to the youtube queue, if they can see the device, they can send items to the queue and even worse delete them.  I understand that it is a young device, but this issue needs to be looked at.  My second issue is with Amazon.  I ordered 2 chromecasts, sent to 2 address, prior to the Netflix cut off time, but have still not received an email with the 3 month Netflix code.That said, the device is brilliant.  I use it with windows laptops, android phones and a samsung chromebook.  Streaming locally from a chromebook, or pc works as long as you have a fast router and fast computer.  The netflix integration is very well done.  It is possible to start a video on the phone, switch it to the chromecast, then back to the phone, walk into another room and put it on the tv there.

My wife is forever showing me photos and video from Facebook and YouTube. This perfectly throws it from her computer to the TV where I can see it. My 8 year old son uses his voice controlled Nexus 7 to watch YouTube game videos and such and he is now able to throw them to the TV when no one else is watching TV. The thing just works for us. We have a Roku box and that is how we consume Netflix and Amazon video as well as some streamed Plex movies and other shows. The Chromecast is very close to replacing the Roku if Amazon would update their app as well as a few others. The Roku box is awesome, don't get me wrong. But I can see this replacing Roku quickly as apps are updated with the Chromecast functionality.I did have one small setup glitch though and had to use my smartphone instead of laptop.
