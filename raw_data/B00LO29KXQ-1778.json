Have been a Prime member for years...and have purchased the Firephone, the Echo, and the HDX 8.9. In spite of already having a smart tv, I purchased the fire stick for several reasons; first and foremost was ease of navigation, and it accomplishes that flawlessly.But a big reason for purchasing this was to Miracast from my HDX and Fire phone easily. That is where my disappointment lies. For those that aren't familiar with Miracast, in my case, it is mirroring whatever is on the screen of your tablet or phone onto your tv screen. A great feature if you want to watch the news, or anything on the web, on a big screen.  Thinking all of my products were Amazon, connectivity shouldn't be an issue...and in the beginning it wasn't. Worked beautifully. But, after automatic updates, it rarely works now. Same issue, whether from my Firephone or HDX, they connect and state the mirroring will start soon, but it never does. After reading many blogs and forums, I'm obviously not the only one having issues with this.In summary, if you're purchasing the Fire Stick for navigating the Prime content, photos, etc., it can't be beat....works great. If you want or need the Miracast ability, you might want to look at other options.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "There is so much you can do with this.
