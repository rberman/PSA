Which is doubly convenient when the kids are arguing over the main tv in the house. It's comparable to the Roku, but less expensive. I use it for Netflix, Amazon Prime Videos, and YouTube.

It is faster and more user friendly than my Apple TV with the huge added bonus of being able to access Amazon's huge library of content through Prime instant video. Fire stick also has way more apps than Apple TV plus neat features like parental controls. Having used Apple tv and roku 2 previously, nothing compared to the features and performance of this tiny media streaming device. Hats off to Amazon for another great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jritch"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love all the options", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Katie Boik"}]
