It may jump to 5 over time. The interface is pretty solid and user friendly. I'm mainly using it for Netflix, Amazon and ESPN 3 access on a TV that doesn't have any of that hooked up to it from another device. All those apps work well and deliver great video quality. I am attempting to use Flixster, as well, even though I hold it and it's sister company in contempt. Flixster is the one app I have not liked thus far. Mainly, their video compression and delivery is not near the level of Amazon and Netflix... so why production companies keep using it is beyond me. That's not really a knock on the Fire Stick, though. Would like to see an IMDB app on it, too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
