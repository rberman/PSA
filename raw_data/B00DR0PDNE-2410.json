[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I just spent a frustrating hour and a half trying to set up my Chromecast.1.  I tried to use my iPad.  It's an iPad 1 and won't accept the App.2.  I tried to use my laptop.  First I had to download and install Chrome.  Then it wouldn't work because its running Windows XP.3.  I finally tried my iPhone (not my preferred internet device).  I installed the app then followed the instructions and found the Chromecast code number'ed network.  Named the net and then finally decided I was supposed to return to my own WiFi network.  Then it wanted my WiFi password.  While I went and found it, the connection timed out.  I tried to restart it, but kept looping back to the first screen.I've given up, I will return the Chromecast to Amazon for a refund!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "John Robertson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We already have APPLE TV, although CHROMECAST doesn't offer everything that APPLE TV does, its a nice alternative to have in addition for another TV in the home.

That being said, using an iPhone to operate a Chromecast is one of the simplest, user-friendly ways to watch Netflix or YouTube. My wife and I bought Apple TV's before Chromecast JUST to watch Netflix in other rooms (without using other bulky netflix-capable hardware: PS3, XBox, etc...).This really is a great piece of hardware. My only recommendation to Chromecast is to include other services like Amazon Prime Instant Video and possibly Mirroring.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ryandickneite"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Doesn't stream as fast as I've seen Blu-Ray or Apple TV players stream, but works perfectly fine.

I have two at my house and two of the TVs at my office have them too (which doesn't help productivity all that much, but is totally great and super convenient anyway).  Plug it in and watch youtube/netflix/whatever without having to set up a set top box.

Overall very happy with the device, had to reboot my router for the initial setup to work properly, but no other problems since then.
