I own both the Amazon Fire TV and Stick, as well as a Roku 2 XS and Apple TV. I have streamed on all these devices as well as various TV apps and Dvd apps etc, and I can state without doubt that both Amazon Fire devices are far superior to the rest. By superior, I'm referring to speed, audio and video quality etc... I highly recommend either device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steve Little"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I wish more more movies form the 50's & 60's had \"Prime\" status.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephen Roka"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely love my amazon fire stick!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Terra Martoccia"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Plug it in and get out of the way!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert C.
