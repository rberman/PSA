It is pretty quick and the interface is decent.  My only complaint is that Amazon services are preferred in the interface over say Netflix, but it is made by Amazon, so expected.  Also, no HBO Go at this point, but it supposed to be coming soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Hard to set up.

It does experience some slowness or \"lag\" at times, but no major issues with it.My only issue is the user interface for browsing Prime Instant videos and the Amazon App Store.We've been using this device everyday since it was released last year. It has replaced our Apple TV, Rokus and cable service. It allows you to watch Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. You are able to download numerous apps and games as well. However, some games do require a game controller from Amazon to play them. Apps like Spotify do not have actual apps, but you must use your phone or other device to send music to your Amazon Fire TV stick. While this works it would be much better to have an actual Spotify app. With that said, there are still a fair amount of quality apps to use on this device and you will have no shortage of entertainment. I've had this device for almost a year now and the Amazon Basics batteries that came with the remote are still going. There is also an app offered by Amazon to use on your handheld iOS/Kindle/Android devices that will allow you to search via voice, use your deices keyboard to search and allow you to navigate your Amazon Fire TV. If only they would add a feature that allows you to navigate through your apps and open them on your Amazon Fire TV within the remote app itself. I definitely recommend this product and could see myself buying more of these for other rooms in my house or for friends and family.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "C.

Great that you can unplug it and take it with you or move to another room.  Seems to drop connectivity occasionally or say my internet is too slow to stream (it's not).  unplugging the poser to get it to re-link to the home network brings it back on line.Makes renting easy - will never need to go to RedBox again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven Pavelitz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Loving the fire stick", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Edwin Spencer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "fantastic devicevery handy", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Justin"}]
