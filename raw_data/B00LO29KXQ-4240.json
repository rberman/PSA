[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love the fire stick. It's more responsive than my Roku and more powerful than the Chromecast.

It was late in the night when I finally finished work and I decided to attempt hooking it us (against the protests from my girlfriend). Within three minutes I had it hooked up, and when I turned it on it already knew it was me. All I had to do was put in our wifi password and we were off and running. The streaming was instant. We have Netflix on our TV through Apple TV and there is always a short delay. Not with the fire TV Stick. It was instant and the picture was crystal clear.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Barbara J  Hawk"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I meant five stars. It works great.

This works great and is easy to set up. No voice command on the remote but does everything in our life have to be? I was very pleased with the signal and lack of buffering. You can't tell you are using this, as the picture is identical to your TV. No buffering, no digital camo. Great for travel to take your Prime on the road with you!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BluePnut"}]
