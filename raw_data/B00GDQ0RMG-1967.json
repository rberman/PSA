It's very easy to install and the quality of the picture and sound is great. I started binge watching Downton Abbey and was really into it but they wanted me to purchase season 5 for $20 so I'm planning to check into Netflix or Hulu to see if they have better rates.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steph"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This works very well.
