Actually ended up taking our roku upstairs and trying this downstairs. Not much better. Took forever to download netflix and hulu. Screen freezes but audio runs. Wrestled for quite a while just to get batteries into the remote. Online now buying another roku device. Google chromecast even blows this away.
