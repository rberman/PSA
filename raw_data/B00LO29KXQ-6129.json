[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Simple and very easy to use. The best part? Its quick! I've used various different devices to stream Netflix and other apps and this software along with the remote is by far my favorite. The menu is snappy and nothing feels sluggish like my bluray player or other devices. Highly recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike Heath"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I've been using the Chromecast ever since its release and the only thing I disliked about it was not having Amazon Instant Video access.  Once I saw this was out and had a pre-release sale that made it 20 a piece I thought I'd give it a whirl.  I've used it everyday now for 5 days.From out of the box and up and running in less than 5 minutes.Things I Like:User Interface that puts many apps a few clicks of the remote away.Ability to use Smart Phone to control TV (like ChromeCast)It seems to run a little faster than ChromeCastThings I Dislike:Laggy video - The video will pause while audio continues and then appears to speed up to sync (unsure if this is a wifi issue on my end but I think it may be the device itself)Warning message when trying to use TV USB power - I have it plugged in using AC adapter as it recommends but I intend on switching to TV power at some point.  I really hope there isn't a big drop of speed and functionality of the device.Overall - In comparison to the ChromeCast I'd have to say I like the Amazon Fire TV Stick slightly more.  Installation is quicker and the remote is very handy.  I think with the gradual updates we're likely to see some of my complaints may be resolved. If you are weighing your options between the ChromeCast and Amazon Fire TV Stick you can't go wrong either way.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Atuor"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to setup and use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael White"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was hoping the remote had the voice search feature like the Fire box.  Also, really hard to figure out how to get the back panel of the remote open to insert the batteries.  Manual give no clue that you need to press down in order to slide the cover off.  Almost sent the product back as I was stumped - and I am a guy who is very familiar with tech products.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gary Streuter"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have had my Fire TV Stick for a few days now and so far, the experience has been great! When setting it up, the MAC address was easy to find, at the right of the available wifi networks. This is a big deal for me because my university limits the number of wireless devices students can have connected. I have to provide this to IT before it will connect to the internet in my dorm. I'm glad amazon made this so easy to access!I really like the interface. It's more updated than Apple TV and more attractive than Roku. It has specific areas for prime content so it's easy to find the shows and movies that are free to stream for prime members. The Netflix app has been updated and now supports profiles within the app. This way, I have recommendations specifically for what I watch, not everyone else who watches. I considered purchasing a Fire TV before the stick was released and one of the main reasons I didn't was the lack of Netflix profiles support.It really is a great value for the price. It's navigation compared to Apple TV requires less clicks to get to what I want to watch. I prefer it to the Chromecast because I don't have to start playing content and then send it to the TV. I'm considering getting a game controller so I can use it's gaming ability to the fullest.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Tristan Wolfe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!
