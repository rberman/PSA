[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I don't usually write reviews in less it's something that is really good, like other reviews I have read I agree Amazon fire TV. They hit it out of the park, I used to have a Roku for about a year then it just stopped working, so I saw that Amazon came out with fire TV. I thought I would give it a try. So glad I did. The picture quality is excellent, it does take some getting used to. When you're used to working with Roku but it's like anything else, once you get used to it. It gets comfortable. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the only thing I don't like is that when you're looking for something to watch and you scroll over it. It doesn't tell you how much it is to rent or buy. You actually have to click on the only thing that I like better about the Roku was just that when you went to the movie list and you scrolled over the top it would tell you how much it is to buy or rent with fire TV, you actually have to click on it and then you have to go to the other and see what more options are other than that I would've given it five stars, and as other reviewers have written the voice control does work very well. It is much easier, especially when you don't know how to spell certain things or people's names. If you're looking things up by actor. All in all, I highly recommend it over Roku. Excellent job Amazon. Great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "montess1"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am a HUGE T.V. junkie!  Amazon fire TV allows us to watch Prime on our television instead of using our devices. Prime has every single show I love and they have excellent original programming like Alpha House and Wishenpoof (for my daughter).  And now several HBO programs have been added to the line up.  We were watching Prime on our computer but now it's on the big screen and I love it!  Even my husband was amazed when he called up some random classic movie and it came up instantly.  I really can't say enough good things.  I've had no technical issues with the device.  Simple plug and play.  The remote is very easy to navigate.  If you have Amazon Prime then Fire TV is more than worth the investment.  I'm even considering cutting some of my cable channels and selling my DVD's.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Tracy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Hi--I'm hoping someone can help me. I have a Samsung smart T.V.  I have been viewing Netflix shows but recently my T.V. has been unable to connect Netflix to the internet. Comcast and Netflix say the problem is with Samsung and Samsung has been amazingly unhelpful.  If I buy Amazon Fire TV does anyone know if that will bypass the TV problem and connect to my wifi/network set up?Thanks for any help.Martha", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"reading addict\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "First let me say we've purchased the \"other\" set-top streaming box and never could get it to work with our home network setup.  So we were a little hesitant with trying this.  But we are huge Netflix & Amazon Prime video watchers and loved the idea of the setup top box vs using the sad interface on our BluRay player, so we jumped.It was super easy to setup with our wired network and joined our network with no problems.  The interface is very intuitive and Netflix setup was easy and offers a great interface as well.We seldom watch regular TV anymore.  We are finding TV series and movies we've never seen.  It has been excellent for the entire family.  Our son loves the voice search.  He's able to find things he wants easily, and we've stumbled across some things we'd never have thought to look for along the way.Great product!

This is underhanded and just plain wrong!That aside it's a wonderful device!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have a variety of streaming players (Apple TV, Roku 3, & Netgear GTV).  Of the four players, this is my current favorite.  I really enjoy the speed, variety available without a lot of strings attached, and the ease of use.  The voice search, while limited, has worked very well.The only real complaint that I have is the way the search function(s) work.  The letters and numbers are in a line instead of a grid and this makes entering search terms much more difficult than it needs to be.  Amazon should have sacrificed a little more screen space to better implement the alpha-numeric \"buttons\" used to enter search strings.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Henry Cox"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Amazon Fire TV. It has so many apps available. The remote is great, no line of sight needed. It has better wifi speed than my old Roku. Amazon preloaded it with my Amazon account so I just plugged it in and it was ready to go with all my Amazon library, and my photos from the Amazon Cloud. I have my photos as my screensaver, I love that.Yes, some things could be improved. I would like to know before I click on a show or movie if it is available free, for rent, or purchase. It would make searching much easier.I hope there are updates coming to correct little flaws and make it even better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Stephanie J.

I have a subscription to Netflix so she can watch movies free, but when I looked at my account attached to Amazon, I have hundreds of charges for movies that she watched on Amazon Prime because when she thinks that she's watching Netflix, the movie is on Amazon prime. The device automatically goes to Prime, especially for the next movie even though you have just watched a Netflix movie. You have to continually make sure you are on Nexfilx, each time you find a movie or you may find many charges on your account for costly Prime movies. She is now afraid to watch anything because she's afraid of incurring changes on my account.
