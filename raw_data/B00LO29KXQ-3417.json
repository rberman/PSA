We waited patiently for weeks before a new batch was in stock and shipped out. When it finally arrived we immediately unplugged our old Chromecast from the living room TV and setup the Fire TV stick. We loved that it came with a dedicated remote control (Chromecast does not have one) and that you could also control it through an app on your phone or device. We were also really excited that we would once again be able to watch programs on Amazon including digital movies that we rented or purchased AND Prime Amazon Instant Video content. Things were great for the first couple of weeks but then we started running into problems:- Hulu and Netflix skip and stop frequently during playback (but Amazon shows don't)- YouTube is difficult to navigate (takes FOREVER to type something into the search bar)- The keyboard on the iPhone app doesn't work- The \"cast\" button that you use with Chromecast recognizes your fire stick (YouTube app on iPhone and in the Chrome browser on your computer) and it says that it works but it doesn't.- Can't add things to the TV queue with YouTube the way you can with Chromecast- Because the Chrome browser cast button doesn't work (even though it sees your Fire TV and says that it will work) you can't share your desktop or your browser screen on the TV.Overall we are just disappointed with Fire TV. We really thought it was going to have greater capabilities than Chromecast, but in reality it's just the opposite. Now we are planning to go back to our Chromecast. I think that Fire TV will be a secondary device in our house. The only use I'll really have for it will be to watch any shows or movies that we buy, rent, or stream from Amazon from time to time but for the big players (Hulu, Netflix, YouTube) we will be using Chromecast.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael E.
