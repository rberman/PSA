Really really don't like this because when I search manually through the other systems it shows the show I was searching as available and FREE.

I received a replacement module and it doesn't work any better than the first.  Sometime it works, but most of the time it doesn't.  Amazon tech representatives keep me on the phone for about six hours total and never turned it into a piece of reliable hardware.  The Stick has line-of-site to my TV--about 10ft.  The module says the signal is from excellent to fair, but will not connect consistently.  Sometimes it's connected, but most of the time it is not.  Most of the time I see the screen saver photos.I bought this hardware at the intro price of $20 and I'm glad I did because it is not worth the current price of $90!!!!  Amazon blew it on this project!PS  the Aamzon tech reps have no idea to fix this problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dcstoo"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Unhappy that it required plugging it in to an outlet.

It is so easy to install and I have been able to view multiple seasons of TV shows that I never had the opportunity to see.  I love how there are no commercials during the shows and that it automatically goes from one episode to the next.  They also have a great selection of movies to view.  My only regret is that I did not buy this long ago. It has already paid for itself because my local cable company charges a ridiculous amount for earlier seasons of TV shows that I was able to view at no cost after purchasing my fire stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pat Halbe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire Stick works remarkabley well. The instuctions that were included,though, were very basic and vague. It would've been helpful to have more detailed instructions on how to navigate the set-up with the remote. We discovered how to do that by trial and error and it was alittle frustrating. The product itself, however, is awesome!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Khuriun"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Quick delivery easy set up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "maria"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

Unlike Google stick which can only be controlled by phone (with app) and no include remote, or Roku,  which does not offer cell phone control, this has the best of both worlds.
