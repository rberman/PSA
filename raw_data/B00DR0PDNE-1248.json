[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This works better then I dreamed it would. Several apps have been added since I bought this many months back. I love being able to connect my Netflix and VUDU accounts and watch my movies on my big flat screen. The new updates are coming quickly and I'm pleased with all of them. I enjoy watching my videos and viewing my pictures through Chromecast. I can share them with everyone all at once. Much easier than passing my Smartphone or Tablet around the room. They are even creating games just for Chromecast. They are very simple right now but the developers are working on it and I'm excited to see what they come up with. This is a plus I never thought of. My movies stream with no problem. When I first got it the streaming was hit and miss. Getting through a movie was difficult. The fact that it has improved so much since I got it proves to me that they are on top of it and working very hard to keep adding new apps and making their product better all the time. The price is great for all the things it does. This is a wonderful gift to get someone and with Christmas right around the corner this is a great time to stock up. I recommend this very highly to everyone I know. I bought this for myself last Christmas and it was the best present I got. I was very pleased at how quickly it arrived. My experience with Amazon has always been good.
