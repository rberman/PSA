However, you can't cast Chrome browser's from the Android operating system.  (Who know why Apple iOS or Window is ok but not Android.  Isn't Android a Google product.)  I also can't cast my Android's screen because it's not supported on my Dell tablet or Moto G (only about a dozen specific devices are supported).  You have to really check out the fine print on the advertising from Google to get the truth.  Based on the Google site and other reviews, I thought I could do both.  I already have two ways to watch YouTube or Netflix or Hulu on my smart TV and four ways to listen to streaming music on my stereo.  That seems like all you get from Google's Chromecast.  If you still need to get Netflix to your TV, Chromecast works.  If you want something that you can't get any of twenty different ways (smart TV, Internet connected BluRay, Roku, Kindle Fire, etc.), don't believe Googles advertising.  I read that I should be patient and all the stuff I want will come on future updates.  Maybe and maybe I'll see pigs fly.  In the meantime Google has my money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "HabyD"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Good for travel and streaming but if your at home just get a streamer with apps already installed. Its too much to download whatever to your devices and then connect it to this device and then having to keep going back to ur phone or tablet to watch different content. Too much or maybe im just lazy. I love streaming from my ps4 and my Roku hd.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Candi Frazer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good devise.
