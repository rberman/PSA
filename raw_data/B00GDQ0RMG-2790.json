We loved our Fire TV in the living and the Fire TV Stick works just like it. We use our Fire TV Stick in our bedroom and it works wonderfully. My wife recently stole the Fire Stick for a business trip and wants to buy another just for traveling. She had access to all her Amazon Prime and Netflix shows without opening her laptop. It is better to watch on a 42\" hotel screen than your 13\" laptop. Only down side it does not do everything the Fire TV box does, but most of those extras we hardly use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Merv"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is my first step towards a cable-free life.  I am an Amazon Prime member and use their services a lot.  And since I wanted a streaming service it was sort of a no-brainer to try the Fire Stick especially at the relatively low priceThe set-up was easy. The wi-fi receiver on it seems to be very good. My reception has been fine even tho I'm currently using it on a tv that is on the second floor at the opposite end of the house from where the wi-fi router resides.My only real complaints so far are minor.  I really dislike the user interface. It's very cluttered.  Unfortunately I don't think any of the other streaming services are any better in that respect.  If you're looking for something in particular, there's no problem.  But if you just want to browse title, it's not very effective.  I'm also not overly fond of the remote (yet another one). It works fine but It's black on black so if you're using it in a dark room and not familiar with the buttons, you'll need to turn a light on.  Guess I'll have to try out the app and see if I can ditch the remote.All in all its a good purchase and I have no desire to try any other stick at this time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Harper"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Out of 3 we have purchased, we have had one failure of the stick itself.
