Not worth $99 when you factor in you need another $99 for prime membership and $50 for gaming remote.  Voice search is an awesome feature until you find out it only works with Amazon instant video.  Hardware is nice and sleek,  Very easy to use, just not worth $99.  Be ready to have to filter through all of Amazon's video titles as they do not have an option to only search only PRIME material that you pay for.  Do not recommend at this price point", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/6", "author": "Joshua Bullard"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this device.

Luckily they appear to be software related so eminently fixable. First, it will occasionally not allow you to play videos from any apps if it hasn't been used for an extended period of time (12+ hrs). The only fix that works is to unplug it and plug it back in. This brings me to my second issue which is the inability to restart the Fire TV without unplugging it, this should be a software setting. And lastly I want to have PIN security for app or movie/tv show purchases, but I should not be prompted for my PIN when trying to watch a Prime movie/tv show, when I am a Prime Member, it is annoying! Other than that I love the Fire TV, as it's much faster than the competition and playback is smooth and generally flawless.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Travis Atkinson"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This product is an excellent option, but it's not at all useful if you don't have a Fire tablet or an Amazon Mobile device.Actually I plan to buy a bundle that include an Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire HDX 7\" the next month.

We were using an older Roku and needing to reboot was becoming a daily affair. Fire TV was a piece of cake to setup; it knew my identity and synced up my content right away. The TV resolution and sound instantly improved. The speed is fantastic and the box never needs to be rebooted. My only wish as a 6 year kindle user, Audible user, and long time Amazon customer is easier access to my audiobooks, Amazon music, & Kindle books. They should be right in the menu just like photos are. With those items on the main menu, this would be a five star rating.July 21, 2014 update; changed to 5 starsMusic has now been added to the main menu. More Apps are available and I am seeing better integration between Fire TV and apps I use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "The Bird Lady"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "free channel not too much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Gib"}]
