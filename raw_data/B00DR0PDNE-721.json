If you don't have wifi, I'd question how you're technologically advanced enough to have a smartphone, but more importantly this won't work without it.

Keep in mind, your TV needs a USB port to plug it into the back of your TV. Otherwise, you'll need to use the regular plug, with a long wire that comes with the device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brand X \"Alpha Tango\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Returned.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mary Miller"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Terrible video quality.
