[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Recently purchased the Fire TV stick and I am very disappointed.  While the features are great, especially being able to verbally call up movies, I have found that when movies play, the scenes shot at night or in dark rooms are virtually impossible to see.  I tried adjusting the TV's brightness and other controls to no avail.  I have a Roku player on my TV up front and I do not have that problem.  The TV I had the Fire Stick on was a Samsung 27\" LED, and the TV with the Roku on it is a Samsung 37\" LCD.  i am going to try another similar product and see if that makes a difference. .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Billf"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Has worked flawlessly over the last few months since purchased!

I give it a 5 star. It's very fast, I like the processor speed, the memory is a decent amount. I'm glad I bought this and as as gift for mother's day. More faster than the Roku 2 box and cheaper in price . I recommend this to anyone. Buy it, it's awesome! Worth the price .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Anthony"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works grate I have not had any problems with at all.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul R.

A problem is that it works through the wifi and it seems like it has to reconnect every time you do something else on your phone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "matthew corliss"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A great alternative to cable.

However, This works just fine. Do not even bother with the ChromeCast. Very few times does it pause and buffer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patricia Porter"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great!!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it! I have it on my tv in my master bedroom, it reaches downstairs and to the other end of the house where my router is at, and never loses connection. I don't even have the extra power cord plugged in! I always had to wait on my samsung blu ray players to buffer with netflix/prime video. This never does that, it is awesome.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gavin Strader"}]
