[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Don't waste your time. I can't get it to connect to my network at all. That's only if I can get to the \"connect to network\" portion of the set up. It usually freezes three or four times before I get that far. The first one I received from Amazon did the same thing and it was extremely hot to the touch after just a few minutes. After chatting with Amazon they decided that the fire stick was the issue and they would send me a new one. Now the new one does the same and is also very hot to the touch. I am beyond disappointed! I bought two of these for Christmas presents and they are completely unusable!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. Bloom \"Kenzie's Ma\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Buy it.

There are a few things missing like HBO GO which is supposed to be available by years end.  What I do like vs. the Roku is that with the recent unlimited photo and video storage for prime members is the ease of which to view photos on the tv and to flip with the touch of a button.  I did have the ability with Roku to view photos from my computer using a pay for app but it is awkward and cumbersome and more like a slide show then the Fire Stick.  The Youtube app is pretty easy to use and it is easy to setup the ability to send the video to the tv.  The fire remote seems more sensitive then the Roku remote in that you don't have to be right in front of the device to activate it.  It is also smaller and easier to take it to another location.  The app for tablets is ok, the best feature of it is voice search.  Lastly, it came early and was delivered on a Sunday of all things.  Awesome.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Janice"}]
