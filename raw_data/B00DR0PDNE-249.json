And I have fun playing off his techiness. LOL!  When it came, we plugged it in, and sure 'nuff, worked just like they said it would.  But my TV is already set up with a Chromebook.  And for no more TV than we watch, it's working fine with plenty of selection.  And I'd rather \"watch\" TV than play with it ~ LOL.  But now that I'm looking at it again....just may go home tonight and see if anything makes it different than what I have~~~", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"Pam\""}]
