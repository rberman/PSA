My sister bought the Five TV (she loves it, only has one TV), and I wanted something that would be portable to TV to TV or take it anywhere with me, so I decided to purchase the stick.  I must say I am very happy.  It is very portable and has the apps that I want.  Configuration was simple, once you setup and get the stick on your network and once you download the app to your phone, you do not need the controller at all.  The app on your phone is must easier to use and it has a voice control and a keyboard to search for items within every app on the stick for easy setup for each one.  Being a prime member for years I know how it feels to have something to use to communicate with all the services that amazon offers in a small package, now I do not have to bring my tablet always with me to watch something.Do not take it from me, try it yourself.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jason \"Jason\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!
