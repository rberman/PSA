[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "My daughter and granddaughter live with me. My daughter bought HERS at BestBuy (naughty, naughty) but I got my first one from Amazon for my non-smart TV.  Dumb as a brick, that thing.  The Fire Stick changed MY life.  When Prime day came, I THOUGHT I got it for the $25, but didn't, but what the heck, my granddaughter does not have a cable box in her room, and has been unable to watch her TV at all.  I bought this second one for her, and she's delighted.  She can watch her beloved Creative Galaxy, and other Prime Only shows, plus Nevflix, etc. She loves CookieSwirlC on YouTube and that's what she watches most of the time.  She loves it!  I love having her have the ability to watch TV while I am cleaning her room.  This is also good when I wanted to watch a movie not age appropriate for her.  I'll watch one, and she'll be done with hers for the day.  I'm very happy with this!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fun!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jim"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "For starters, the Fire TV Stick is significantly slower than both my Google Chromecast and Roku Streaming Stick.  I acknowledge, however, that this is \"comparing apples to oranges\" in terms of what each product is supposed (repeat supposed) to offer.  But comparing these products is exactly what Amazon does in it's product listing.  So fair game.  Beyond these speed (or lack thereof) issues, it is often impossible to even get the Fire TV Stick out of \"sleep\" mode without unplugging and restarting the device.  Again, I've never had that problem with my Google Chromecast or Roku Streaming Stick.  The biggest issue, perhaps, is that the Fire TV Stick doesn't properly support a number of mainstream apps - namely Hulu Plus.  It freezes and stutters constantly (and no, it's not my internet connection).  Given this problem is well-known to Amazon (e.g., http://www.amazon.com/Hulu-Plus/dp/B00F4A1GN6/), and considering the many streaming media players now on the market, you'd think Amazon would collaborate with Hulu (et al.) to get this \"essential\" app to function right on its Fire TV Stick.8/16/2015 Update: Syncing to my Fire Phone via Miracast now requires disconnecting the power/restarting the Fire TV Stick.  As if it isn't hassle enough to have to scroll through the menu to activate Miracast every time one wants to mirror?  Enough is enough...  going back to Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "PJ"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is perfect!

I had been wasting so much time, waiting for the buffering of my Netfix programs to finish.  Now I can watch Netflix, Youtube, HBO Go, and so many other programs, in a way they were meant to be watched, without tons of delays as they were buffering.  This TV Stick is easily worth five times as much!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Tom"}]
