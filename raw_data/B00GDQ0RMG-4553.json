At first I was having a few issues with it and I still have a few qualms with the design. When the internet hangs or Netflix decides not to buffer, I have to unplug the stick and plug it back in. Syncing with my Amazon music took FOREVER for some reason. I don't like that I can't just plug the usb into the TV usb port for power. I am assuming it's that TV just not made to power that jack but it would shave a cord off of my power strip if I didn't have to plug the TV stick in. Oh well.I love that it goes to screensaver if idle too long and that I can define a library from my Amazon cloud. The interface is easy to navigate. I love having access to my Amazon cloud. I think it would be cool to set some kind of visualization other than screen saver where the music is concerned.Overall I am satisfied. The price for prime members at 20 bucks was just too good to pass up. I'd been wanting to try Roku or Google but the cost wasn't worth it when I can access all the same stuff from my computer and display on my TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ttbloodlusttt \"Angie\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "But need more Apps", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Fidel Francisco Aquino"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works just as stated.
