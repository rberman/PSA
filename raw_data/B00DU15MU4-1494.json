Only complaint is the free movies should be in a seperate place from all the pay movies.  Be careful because something may say you have to rent it but if you look in Netflix you can get it for free.  They should somehow fix this bug as well but I really love it!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karen Stewart"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It awesome item.

It is much faster than either of the Roku's that I own.  I especially like how the Photo's and Videos are integrated into the menu system if you are a Prime member and load the Amazon cloud drive app.  It is nice to be able to view all the photos and videos on the big screen.  The voice search is helpful but does only work with Amazon apps etc...  Love this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Xair"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it and it works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bnlusa \"bnlusa\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Fire TV Me and are family can not get enough of it.
