Also not all devices do \"Cast screen\", luckily my Samsung S5 has that ability so I can cast picture slideshows etc.. Great device though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hiram"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy set up.

I imagine this stretched out my basement TV purchase by 3-4 years because I love my Plasma Screen and now can get Netflix on it.  I've had this about 12 months and have two minor gripes: - Sometimes (25%)  I have to reset it to get Netflix to work - Hope more apps will be featuring ability to Cast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jill"}]
