Unfortunately there is a noticeable lag when using Bluetooth controllers.My biggest problem though is how weak the WiFi reception is on the thing. My Chromecast plugged into the exact same HDMI port could handle streaming a videogame from my gaming pc at 720P@30FPS flawlessly. The fire stick in the exact same HDMI port can barely get signal on 2.4 or 5ghz. I sometimes resort to putting my phone into hotspot mode and connecting to the internet with it(thank goodness for unlimited data).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michelle E.
