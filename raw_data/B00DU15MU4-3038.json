When I watch the same movie on my Smart TV from Amazon Prime these is a totally difference in quality of the picture as Day and night (much better shown on Smart TV). However the content of programs offered on Amazon Fire TV is so rich in quantity.Because of the poor quality of the picture (darkish) I prefer to watch the movies offered on Amazon Prime from my Smart TV rather than from Amazon Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/12", "author": "Claude A.

It is small enough to be portable from room to room. I even use it on my patio to see TV outdoors when dining with friends and family. Just bring out a 32\" Flat Screen, plug in HDMI and watch TV.

The real value of this device is voice recognition for searching content.  I was so motivated to get rid of the tedious process of on-screen keyboarding that I bought the Fire TV the first day it was available.  The good news is that the voice-based searching is amazingly good.  The bad news is that I can only use it for 20% of the things I want to do (ie Amazon content search).  The Netflix app provided by Fire TV (and its terrible user experience) is identical to what is already built-in to my LG TV.  Same for Pandora.  That makes the Fire TV just one more island of content isolation in my media world -- and who needs that?  So, my Fire TV is going back to Amazon.  It will be interesting to see what happens next.  Either Amazon will build content neutrality into Fire TV or suppliers of content neutral devices (e.g. Roku) will figure out effective voice recognition.  Whoever gets there first will win my business.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/8", "author": "andy2m"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome. Was not sure how it would enhance our TV watching experience at first but it has made it much easier to enjoy apps and use prime.Previously had to sign in through PS3 which worked fine but the fire tv system is 100 times faster and the voice control is way cool!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hollimarie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This device is great. With a Prime membership you can stream most movies and TV for free and the reception is excellent. A great buy for $99.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mary Kay Brady"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love the voicesearch.  Amazon prime movies does seem limited. Works like most streaming players.  Of course be aware there is no password to put in when your paying for a movie or game. So anyone who has access can just click and buy a movie on your account. Also although the player sleeps when no used I prefer some kind of off on button or command. But I unplug for now. Watch you internet band usages. Otherwise I like the ability to stream HD right to the tv. And not having to use the computer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "G.

The content is also very good and growing. I like the Bloomberg TV and all the available documentaries. I can also utilize my Prime membership to view tons of movies on my large screen TV (finally). We have google chrome but its only good for streaming web pages and youtube. The Fire TV gives you tons of content, quickly and easily which are included in your Prime membership. Note: I recommend upgrading your wireless router. It definitely helps if you have a up to date modem and wireless router. Comcast usually will upgrade your equipment if you haven't done so in a few years and use Amazon to research and order a new dual band wireless router. I recommend Cisco or Netgear.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JFadelle"}]
