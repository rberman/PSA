I'm going to downsize my Dish package to just the basic so I can keep my local channels. I don't care about watching episodes a week later and I can do that with all the apps available.  I'm going to try the Prime free trial this week and see how that works out. If I like it I'll cancel my Netflix account since you can only stream old stuff with them and none of the new movies.  The annual fee for Prime works out to about the same as the monthly fee for Netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Esther C.

Keeps losing network connection every few minutes, when all of my other wifi devices are working fine. Saw online that this is a very common problem with the FireStick. Very glitchy. Would like to give it a second try and get a replacement. If that replacement is glitchy as well, then I will return the product for a refund. The short experience I had with the FireStick is enjoyable, but maybe it was too soon to put on the market? This would have been an amazing product if it actually worked properly as intended.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mary E."}]
