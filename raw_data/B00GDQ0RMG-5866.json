[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "It was easy to set up and initially I was pleased with it.  Pandora works well but I'm unable to watch Netflix or movies because there appears to be a problem with the buffering during the data download from our wireless router.  The spinning circle stops at 25% during the download and a message comes up that there is a problem with the router.  The router is located 4 feet away from the Firestick and have never had any problems with any other wireless equipment in our home.There is also a loud \"beep\" periodically when listening to music or when watching a movie.Unless the data download problem goes away, I'll return it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Green Bay Fan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've been playing with my Fire TV Stick for a couple hours now, and I love it. Out of the box it came preregistered to my Amazon account, so I had instant access to all my TV Subscriptions and Prime TV. Setup was a breeze, though I did have a bit of trouble getting the battery cover off the remote to add the batteries (Press the cover inwards where the indent is and then move back. Mine took a little bit of force, but it finally budged).My favorite thing about this has to be the included remote. It has excellent range, and it's very responsive when I navigate the interface.My least favorite aspect, as this is minor, is that  the Fire TV Stick is very finicky when it comes to where you plug the USB power adapter. With my Chromecast I could simply use the USB port on my TV, but the Amazon Fire TV stick has to use included AC power adapter if you choose to use the booster. The good thing is that this unit still works reasonably well (as long as it has a strong WiFi connection) without the external power adapter.I bought this thing because it was offered at a discount for being a Prime member, and because I was curious to see how it would compare. I'm an avid subscriber to TV shows through Amazon Instant, so this turned out far better than imagined. I will be ordering a couple more for family and personal use!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "HUGGIES"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it. I havery cable in the living room and use this in my office. Great for sharing my clod pic and music and catching up on TV shows.

I picked up one on Amazon day one and have no regrets.  I love how you can even side-load apps. I plan on putting one in each kids room. I hope they bring more apps out soon such as Google Music and HBO go. Interface is simple and easy to learn at any age and by far the fastest streaming device I have used. You hit the button and you have your movie. I have a Chromecast but it is always a pain in the rear to pause and constantly losing connectivity. I have a very expensive router with great bandwidth too. Not sure if it the extra under the hood on the fire stick compared to the Chromecast but I can tell a huge difference. Go ahead and purchase one, you will not be disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this portable powerhouse of entertainment!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Johnny Mac"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome streaming device I got 2 I'm very happy with them", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sergio Henriquez"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Functionality is great so far.  Very easy to set up and use.  Not happy about the need for the power strip plug-in connected to the stick...was hoping it could run off the power of the TV.

I wish I could edit my music playlists on here, but only allows me to listen to playlists/music I added online. Additionally,  wish the iphone app would be released. using the remote is fairly annoying, just another remote to have laying around.Overall, the only benefit over my chromecast (which I love) is that it allows me to stream my prime tv shows. it does get misleading which are free/not though.
