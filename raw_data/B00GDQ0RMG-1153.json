It tries to load but constantly resets over and over again. I called customer support, and after numerous attempts of trying to get it to work, they are sending me a new one. Well, I think it's new. Kind of weird that I will only get the actual stick- not a whole new package. I hope I don't get a refurb considering the one I have is basically brand new. Regardless, customer service was nice to deal with. Looking forward to getting my FireTV stick back and in working order.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cat M"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the Fire stick.
