But still liked the idea.I got down to my vacation home and discovered that Charter was going to start scrambling it's signal and each TV would need a box. The Chromecast provided the solution. when used with a laptop or Chromebook I can stream anything in my browser to the TV. So now I can get my Comcast/X-Finity channels and On-Demand  in charter country. Performance will depend on the device used to stream to the Chromecast. The Chromebook is a choppier motion than a more powerful laptop, probably due to the more limited buffering capabilities. Very Happy with the results and the possibilities going forward.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "EJC"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I just loved it, video streaming from google chrome and netflix, I use the most.

Mistake! It dropped connection or froze up more than I could stand (during several Netflix movies too) but the last straw was: it interfered with my Mohu Leaf antenna. I discovered this by accident during one of several \"Chromecast Can't be found\" dropped connections that had me plugging and unplugging the unit. When it was plugged in to my TV it was static city and clear HD when unplugged. I sent it back. My suggestion: buy a Blue Ray that has wifi.
