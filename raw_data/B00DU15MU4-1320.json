Towards the end of the video we starting experiencing buffer issues. This was the first time for this to happen and Amazon noticed the issue and refunded the video on their own. We didn't even file a complaint. I'm amazed by this customer service. Amazon fire tv has been great and the service just it out of the water.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Austin chappell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "reynaldo calderon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought it for my husband for Christmas.

My Internet is usually up and down, but I haven't had a problem with the stream yet. Before the Fire TV I would stream from my laptop, but the quality was honestly not always the best, so this device is a major upgrade. The quality is great, it changes the input for the TV automatically when I wake it up, and generally I don't have any problems with it. I also have a kindle, and I think having both makes the whole amazon experience that much better. The box is tiny, and easily hidden if needed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shanee Campbell"}]
