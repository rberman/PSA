Compared to the \"smart TV\", it is little hard to get used to and not as easy to use.  The main screen is different.  But it works beautifully once I figured it out.  My wi-fi is pretty fast, so there is no problem with buffering of downloads.  I couldn't give it 5 stars, because I am hooked on the \"smart TV\", but considering the fantastic price, it is just what I wanted for my 2nd TV.  I recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shar"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great think to have", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lawrence J. McPhee"}]
