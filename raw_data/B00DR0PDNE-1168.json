[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I hesitating purchased this unit earlier today. My hesitation was because of the uncertainty of it working with my Android device. I have installed it and set it up with great ease on my Samsung Tab S. It seems to work flawlessly so far casting from YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, Hulu,a and a streaming site frontrow.com. I also set it up again with ease on my Windows 7 laptop. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to cast their screen to a TV or just stream movies. Keep in mind this unit does not come with a remote like other streaming players. You can use your phone, tablet, or laptop to control features. Go ahead and pull the trigger! You won't be sorry.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Alan L. Stevens"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Glad it was cheap because doesn't do much my xbmc setup cannot do.  I mostly got it to see what the hype was about.  Not impressed.  The thing that pissed me off the most that it doesn't have a master volume and when youtube contantly resets the casting volume to max, my eardrums get damaged.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jay Agey"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "We rarely use this.

But it's very annoying to use your phone as a remote. There is no easy FF or RW key and it's hard to rewatch small sections of dialogue. Also annoying to use while talking on the phone, if you want to talk, then pause your TV, etc. Used this for a while, was devoted to the Roku for a while, and finally settled on the Apple TV, which offers the cleanest layout, best streaming, and easiest interface with no adds, plus ease of adding multiple Netflix accounts. Of course, the Apple is expensive so if you're looking for the budget option, this is it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mary Anderson \"Salon Savvy\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "No chrome unit in box!
