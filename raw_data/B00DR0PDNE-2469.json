Before the Chromecast, watching Netflix involved finding my laptop, plugging it in and logging on to the website. Pandora used to involve the same thing or finding a power source for my phone and using that as a Pandora player. The same goes for using YouTube. Now with the Chromecast I just turn on my TV and wait for the cast button to appear on my phone's Pandora, Netflix, or YouTube display and cast it straight to my TV. The greatest thing about this product is that the Chromecast assumes the responsibility of the streaming, this leaves your phone free from the constant strain on the battery when streaming.Brilliant packaging and a ten minute setup time made a great first impression on me. The second thing I noticed about the product was the lack of a user interface, leaving this product remarkably simple. Instead of fading to a black screen when not in use the Chromecast displays stunning photography that I will admit to leaving on for the ambiance it adds to a room. If your TV has a HDMI port you really should invest in one of these. There has not been a day since I got it that I haven't used it. A fantastic product and looking forward to buying more for the other TVs in my home.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Hayden"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This little gadget is awesome.  I no longer have to connect my laptop to my tv with a 10 foot long HDMI cable.  I can stream any website I want over the browser.  Now I can watch movies while still working on other things on my laptop wirelessly.  I am also able to stream my Nexus phone and tablet over to the television.  My television's HDMI outlet produces enough power to enable the Chromecast, however a separate charging cable is provided in case its not.Otherwise, I don't think I would have purchased this if it hadn't been on sale.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andy"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Totally misleading! Bet a lot of people got this as a Christmas gift and got burned. This only lets you view netfix and youtube on your TV, which is already built into most new TVs or people have via Roku boxes. Its a waste of money!Last week I heard Google opened up the licensing so 3rd parties can push their apps to the TV through this as well. Better, but still not what consumers want. People want to be able to see ALL their Android apps on their TV, play their games, etc.Save your money for something else. It won't get used.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "N.

Personally, I thought the Chromecast was neat, but we played Netflix through my Son's Nintendo Wii, our television supports Amazon Streaming Video (LOVE Alpha House, guys), so...what were we exactly going to use Chromecast for?At first it was only You Tube things.  THEN.  THE DAY FINALLY ARRIVED:  Chromecast now supported HBO GO!!!!  Now I could introduce my fianc\u00e9 to my favorite shows:  Deadwood, Carnivale, Oz, Rome, Big Love and so many more wonderful HBO productions.  So far we've made it through Deadwood (while watching Deadwood, my fianc\u00e9 asks, \"I had no idea females appreciated Westerns).  Surprise!  Some of us do.  We've torn through Rome, The Sopranos, and we're starting \"Boardwalk Empire\".Your product is magnificent and I know there is more coming.  So thanks, Google!
