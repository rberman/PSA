Incredible addition to our electronics. I refuse to pay cable/satellite to watch TV anymore and the Fire TV option is just what we needed for our not so smart TV!  Excellent product with abundant options!Now if networks would allow more free streaming it would be a dream come true!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lisa T"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This was very easy to connect and easy to use.  The voice search feature works extremely well and beats having to type in the show you are looking for.  There are many shows and movies included with Prime but I would like to see an option from Amazon to allow even more access to shows/movies for a flat package rate versus per episode or series.  Overall I have been very pleased with this purchase and will be ordering the fire sticks when they are back in stock for other tv's in the house.  I am happy to be done with cable!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazon consistently offers great service and great products.  Just as shopping at Amazon is easy, viewing movies and other content through Fire TV is equally easy.I first tried a Roku player and hated it...then I went with Amazon and love the convenience and performance.Plus this device comes with a wonderful screen saver with top quality nature photos - magnificent!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Straight-Talk"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this Amazon Fire TV.

This three step experience turned into a several day nightmare.  If one has to use ethernet be prepared to purchase a cord because I did not see that I would need one in the directions.  I purchased the ethernet cable and proceeded to set up the Fire TV.  It didn't work.  I was not connected to the main set up page, and instead there was a page on the screen instructing me to choose a WIFI connection.  I don't have WIFI and when I reached a box that said that I could configure my ethernet there were so many steps and numbers to find that after several tries I had to take a break.  I asked a knowledgable family member to help and after several hours of frustration we quit.  I even did things like unplug and plug in wires, truned off the power for the room for a time, changed cable ends etc.  I would go into more detail but there is no use in that.I thought perhaps I could get some live  help, but after not finding the \"secret\" number I gave up and am sending this mess back.  I was led to believe that this was a simple set up and received about as many directions as I get from Apple.  The huge difference is that Apple products are easy to figure out and phone numbers are provided.  Amazon, you are not as easy as apple.  I would have kept this item If I could have found help.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/4", "author": "bonnie"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "works great", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BEVERLY MONTGOMERY"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Wondering do you have to have wifi to use this", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Shelby"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great we have this on two of our tv's", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mrubino"}]
