I am an Amazon Prime member so I have had the opportunity to view shows and movies via my Kindle; now I can do the same on my big screen TV. The set up was amazingly simple and it works like a charm. There are loads of movies and shows to pick from, though I am more interested in those that are free! ;-) Still the prices are generally low enough to bear for a movie now and then.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "nucci"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the fire stick.Loads of free content and easy to navigate.No lag.

Easy 5 minute setup and I was good to go!  If I had one small complaint is that the \"one button purchase\" option on my Amazon account must be turned on.  Not a problem when downloading free apps, but if browsing on the pay stuff use caution.
