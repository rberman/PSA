[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've had Chromecast since launch and it's become an indispensable part of our living room (and our travel regimen).  There are several different ways to watch YouTube, Netflix, Hulu+ and HBO Go on my TV, but Chromecast is my favorite: it's simply easy to fire up the app on your smart phone or tablet, or on your PC, Mac or Chromebook, and send it to the TV - in great quality - with the press of one button.  I've also started using Chromecast more and more to stream music from Pandora, Songza and more to our living room TV - connected to the best speakers in our house.I expect Chromecast to continue to add more of the apps that are important to me and improve the features continually.  For $35, Chromecast is a must have for the living room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Now with Hulu, HBOGo, Pandora and a bunch of other apps, I love it even more.

If you do not have a Smart TV at home, it is very good. If you\u00a0do, it's not so great. I am disappointed because when I bought it I thought it would convey all the information from your smartphone screen to the TV. For example, being able to play Angry Birds with the image on TV or view my pictures and videos on TV without cable. No, it does not. It serves for streaming YouTube and Netflix on TVs that are not Smart TVs.

However, iif you're like myself and already don't watch cable or satellite, it's a perfect cheap means to stream your netflix onto the big screen (I don't own a xbox or ps).Pros:- assuming you have a decent internet connection, netflix, youtube, and chrome browser casting stream with well.- you can watch just about anything from anywhere with the chrome browser casting. I use it to watch hulu- easy to usecons:- you need a good internet connection- some delay starting up a cast, but unless you're living somewhere with better internet speeds than the states, it's to be expected.- Maybe I just haven't really looked into it, but anyone on your wifi can control what is playing. This could mean roomates messing with your shows.- you can't use the chrome web browser cast with android smartphones/tables (same for apple if I recall correctly) only windows os smartphones/tablets.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Luna"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Won't work with HBOGo.
