I'm finally getting rid of cable and with this I'm wondering why I didn't do it sooner. Very small and easy to install and use - just plug it in.

I love my fire tv stick. It's easy to use and all of your cloud music and photos are rite there on your tv screen. Not to mention all of the Prime content and Amazon original programs.
