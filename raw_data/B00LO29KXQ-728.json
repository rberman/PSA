But for me, I am compelled to give it a 2 star rating because I could never get it to reliably connect to my wi-fi router.  The user interface seems good, but without being able to connect to program content, I couldn't do a proper evaluation.  It would only connect when I was no more than 10 feet from my router and that is not acceptable.  My Roku boxes all work fine everywhere in my house.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JerryS"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We lost our Roku in a move and this was a great replacement!

I was so excited to get rid of my cable and just use Netflix streaming and Hulu. Having a prime membership and being able to watch some stuff for free, ended up being an even bigger bonus.
