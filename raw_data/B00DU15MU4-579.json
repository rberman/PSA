It is fast and delivers a very clear picture, even in standard definition. Perhaps I didn't read the instructions well enough but I find no \"off\" switch. I don't really like the idea of an appliance that stays on 24/7.

I bought the Fire TV because I wanted to access my Prime shows and movies. The Fire TV is just amazing. It runs Netflix 100x faster, browsing for Prime movies is easy, and I have access to Prime music and iHeartRadio.  No longer do I need to carry my phone room to room to listen to music. I can just turn up the TV volume and walk around. I highly recommend!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jball359"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really like this thing.  Great interface, responsive, intuitive.  My kids play games on it with an XBOX controller, waiting for the Amazon controller.
