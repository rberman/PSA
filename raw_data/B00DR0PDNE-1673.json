We occasionally have family chromecast night where we take turns sharing YouTube videos from our mobile devices over the chromecast. Beats tv a lot of times. Now with a new app I can stream my music to it so when playing a game at the kitchen table, I can control from my phone what music is playing through my system.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

That delay makes it almost impossible to hit a specific, small portion of your screen with your cursor, if you're just looking at the TV. Maybe Chromecast 2 can do better? If the Apple TV can, the technology is already on the market, Google just has to use it.Overall a great idea, and definitely priced right, however, you're not going to get great use out of this, even if you're rolling on a gigabit wifi.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best electronic I've ever bought for this amount of money.
