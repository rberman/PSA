Then I re-read the email stating that you should use the USB extender, when I connected the extender chord, it made the stick work pretty flawlessly.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars, just because the Kindle app doesn't work with my Kindle HD device.

Silly me, I forgot to see if you were Charging for the movies. Soon AFTER I bought the Fire stick, I suddenly realized my mistake. I have been using Netflix for many years and the download selections are all free, Sadly I was wrong. I realize I should have looked a bit harder. So I'm the one at fault.However, I must admit that the Fire TV Stick has some GREAT screensavers.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Art C"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is exactly as described. It was easy to set up and I love using it. The only thing I am disappointed with is actually Amazon Prime TV. There isn't anything on it that I would want to watch that I couldn't find on Netflix or Hulu. After the 1-month free I probably will not upgrade to keeping the prime tv, at least not right now. I may change my mind after using it more, but after all the hype and great reviews about Prime TV, I am just not impressed. Maybe if they showed which movies and TV shows were free at the top rather than which ones your still have to pay for, it would be better. But the Fire TV Stick is very worth the purchase. It beats using the Xbox or the Wii (which doesn't work well anyway) and is at a way better price than buying the whole Fire TV box.Worth a try, especially at the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica Wilson"}]
