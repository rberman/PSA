Also I can connect my computer which is not connected by WIFI, just wired to the router, which means that with the Chromecast you can connect any device that is in the network being WIFI or not. I recommended it, totally worth my money", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scarsms"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is super cool. I use it every day.

I use one (and a Roku 3) in my living room. I use the other in my bedroom. I also downloaded and use the Chromecast app to \"Cast Screen\" from my android phone or iPad 4 to my Chromecast devices. For my needs, they all serve their purpose well. I HIGHLY recommend the free LocalCast app for streaming (aka casting) movies and TV shows with optional subtitles to Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.
