[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I gave up \"regular TV\", cable or satellite, some time back. I began with Apple TV which I still use, though it offers far less, I have a Roku streaming projector, which is much fun watching movies on the wall and a nice selection of app. Yet the remote with the Roku is absolutely clunky, difficult to use. The Amazon fire stick wins out. I got mine for 19.99 on a promotion for Prime members and really expected it to be shoddy  instead, if is, hands down, the best streaming device. The remote is smooth and there are many apps to choose from. Once you realize there are worlds of viewing choices from Netflix, Amazon, and apps that offer more movies, Internet channels (the little ones enjoy the cartoon channel on the Pluto app) --there is no reason to continue paying pathetic satellite or cable bills. I would rather use my money for something important like helping to provide clean drinking water to children in Uganda and elsewhere. Thanks, Amazon for a winner--now offer it on sale again. I would purchase for my older kids.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kargoforth \"Perfection, in a Christian sense, means becoming mature enough to give ourselves to others.\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sarah \"sarah\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great buy for friends / family who are not tech savvy: it's very easy to use via voice (if you have the phone app), and the interface is pretty streamlined as well.I had previously bought my parents an Apple TV, thinking it would be easy for them to navigate...but they ended up \"gifting\" it back to me (lol), as they just couldn't figure it out & use it without frustration. This surprised me, to be quite honest, as I figured the Apple interface would be very user-intuitive. I think the ultra-thin and 'minimalist' apple Remote design might have actually played a part in this.The Fire TV Stick's remote, however, is a bit beefier and feels more substantial...not to mention doesn't get lost as easy!Unfortunately this unit's remote doesn't have the voice-commands of its big-brother built into the remote (separate purchase), but you can't really expect that for the price you pay. It also doesn't have surround sound output like the regular Fire TV -- but again, for the price you pay, this unit really does deliver its worth.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "The Active Geek"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best little media stick with so many options for so cheap!  I plugged it in and was watching Netflix 2 minutes later! Thank you Amazon! I dont even use my Chromecast anymore,  its in my drawer collecting dust!
