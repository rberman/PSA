I just got around to installing it.Technically. it's a five star. Crystal clear HD, no buffering on 5mbs DSL. If you are into Amazon prime video or music, this is the way to go. There are apps for most \"channels\" including HBO and Showtime  and appear to be supported by most large cable and sat networks EXCEPT comcast. I assume this will change.I hit a snag getting it to link to wifi: I don't use a password but instead keep the wifi network hidden. Once I changed the setting on the modem, it hooked right up. I downloaded the iOs app for iPad remote control and that seems to work well, also.This device seems more oriented toward Android devices and OS including the capability of mirrored wireless video between devices. Not so with an iPhone or iPad (yet) For this reason, ONLY, I am deducting one point. I was hoping for this feature but can live without it.All said, it's far superior to my Rokuosaur which was state of the art 4 years ago. I would recommend this, especially for prime users with android phones/tablets... The price is certainly right!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Alfonzo's Amazon prime directive"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you have an Amazon prime account this is a no brainer.
