We dont have cable or anything at home so we use this for prett much all of our tv viewing.

(I can't find the right length of those triple colored cords to reach the tv after we reorganized after christmas.

The audio comes through good enough but the video is completely unwatchable. It's frozen frames while the audio is playing and the audio is always lagging behind the video. It  works a little better with Youtube but still not well enough to say it works. I really like the idea but it's not quite there yet.

However, do read up on the product's limitations, because you will not be able to \"cast\" everything.On the other hand, if you already have (or can get) an HDMI cable for your phone and/or computer, then you can already (or will be able to) do what Chromecast offers and much, much more.  Plus, there is no convoluted means to get it there. With an HDMI cable, you're all set, and there are zero content limitations.  Everything and anything on your device (computer, phone, laptop, tablet, etc.) will \"cast\" to the big screen.Also, keep mind, with Chromecast you will need WiFi access. Perhaps most of us have a wireless router with internet access, I do not. I use my Android as a WiFi hotspot for all my devices that need internet connectivity (and yes, for me that works great). So now, using my phone as a WiFi hotspot I can also use Chromecast to \"cast\" (some) content from my laptop to my 52\" LCD. This works as the product claims. However, I cannot cast anything from the phone itself. For some reason, the Chromecast app for the phone does not understand how to bridge directly to the resident WiFi hotspot. So that functionality is now useless to me. But again, even if it worked, it would have been limited anyway, so who cares. I can go back to my mini-HDMI cable that connects right to the phone (and TV).Finally, in case this is not obvious, the product will \"eat up\" an HDMI port on your TV. So make sure you have one, and make sure you want to sacrifice it to this product. Otherwise, you will become an HDMI jockey, which is one inconvenience most of us don't want.I hope this was helpful.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jan Ophof"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy to use.

From plugging into the TV to start casting Netflix, youtube took only 10 mins. It works flawlessly from both ipad and iphone.The only reason for 4 stars is because once you start the playlist from youtube, after the commercial break between videos, the information bar stays on the TV until you pause and restart the video. A bit choppy and delayed playback when casting from chrome browser unless you close all programs on the computer.
