After reading two different books on using the Fire TV Stick and everything I saw on Amazon, I have a few things to add that would make it absolutely perfect, or at least allow us to know what we were getting.  First, nowhere, anywhere, that I could find, mentioned that you need to have high-speed Internet.  I have satellite (with no other option available) and it just isn't fast enough.  To make it worse, there is no option I could find to have the Fire Stick transmit in standard definition instead of high def.  I have a NetFlix account that is locked in standard definition for those who have with limited bandwidth.  That would seem like a doable feature that could be added.  Second, a little clarification on the directions would be useful--like adding just the name of the remote to use during set-up..  \"Using your TV remote, select the HDMI port that has the Fire Stick plugged in.\"  And, \"Using the Fire Stick remote, put in the security code for your WiFi system.\"  (or whatever the exact wording is)  We are all sitting here with a stack of remotes.  Make it simple by telling us which one to use.  Super product!  Just wish I had more bandwidth.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Linda"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Apparently, I haven't had the experience that some who like this have had, but I would not advise getting this. It almost never works. I have to re-enter my network details almost every time and often that doesn't work and I have to resort to watching Prime shows through the app on my iPhone.I have three other streaming devices (Apple TV, Google Chromecast and a Samsung USB drive). None of these products have caused me anywhere near the headache and frustration that the Fire TV Stick has. It simply does not work. At least for me it doesn't.P", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Patrick Miller \"LA Kayaker\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Melody Waters"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "works fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ray herron"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "i want to point out that i bought mine when that first started sell them and to prime member they where half price.  that being said i like.  work just fine better now the ios remote app is out.  travel better than my other media devices.  now just to compare i own a roku 2 and an apple tv.  so i can say the i uses those two a lot more than the fire stick.  but at the price that i got it it was a steal.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Josh"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I LOVE my Fire Stick!!!
