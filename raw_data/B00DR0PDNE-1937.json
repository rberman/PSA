I use a Nexus 7 or an Acer Chromebook (IMO best choice for a standby internet home computer) to access the device. It doesn't surprise me that some users have problems with IOS or Windows - Google CHROMECAST, right?Once set up I have had NO problems watching YouTube movies or anything else on YouTube thru my HDTV. Do you have to think & choose and operate things to make sure you have or to manage a connection? Of course! This is WIFI stuff - we expect things to get a little quirky sometimes. I don't bother with Netflix or any other subscription service ... there's so much out there gratis. There are Chromecast compatible internet radio apps. IHeart is planning compatibility soon. Pandora is compatible.
