Our house was broken in to when we at a relatives Christmas afternoon and these were stolen before getting the box open.  But, I can't find \"ask a question here\" ......can this connect to a hotel web based internet connection?  We travel a lot, and rather than all of us huddled around our kindles, it makes sense to buy one of these, but only if I can connect by opening a browser to sign in to the internet.  Otherwise, it's no more use for me then my roku 3, in that respect.  Thanks, anyone that can answer this for me :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.

The software does need a bit of work. There needs to be a way to set the sleep timer. Additionally the sleep button needs to be more easily accessible from the main menu. It's currently buried 4 screens down in the settings menu. The interface is very busy, but still easy to navigate... for the Amazon stuff only. Any of the other vendor stuff (YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc.) is buried and bit problematic to find.

I got to see how prime is for a month and i didn't get to use it as much as i should of but thats ok.

My experience living in Maine with DSL is that I cannot get the 'Help' vids to play that came installed. Things never stop 'loading'. I purchased a fireplace app for Christmas and after spending half an hour or so trying to get it to work I moved on frustrated. I noticed yesterday that a couple of the 11 screen options are working but still not all. Looks awesome but lacks functionality. Trying to find the options for importing local files (without buying additional items - an android operating system driven device smartphone or tablet) is impossible without something like another expense purchasing an app like PLEX. If I had dumped cable or sat for this I'd be bumming for sure. Hoping for brighter days ahead.
