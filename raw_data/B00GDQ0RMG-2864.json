Amazon likes to blur the lines between the paid content and what you get with Prime.  I have  the Roku stick as well.  Overall the Amazon Fire Stick is better interface,  more enjoyable interaction.  Love it,  especially at $39.(but I got it for $19 when it first came out,  even better).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AllofUs"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We had Amazon videos from our DVD player on the home theater, but we didn't have it in the family room. We added a Fire TV Stick and I must say, we like it even better. The menus are simple and it plays TV shows back to back. On the DVD player we have to manually start each episode.It's more then just Amazon, it turns any TV into a smart TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MikeReedKS"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sharkey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The best in its class.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mehran Sedaghatpour \"Mehran Sedaghatpour\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Very slow always trying to load!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ami Whitley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "this is incredible.
