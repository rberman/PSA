Because of course, I don't like to be bothered by complexity and nagging maintenace.  To start, we own all three of the streaming devices, but the kids love this one the best. The other two, Chromecast and Apple TV, each have their flaws.Chromecast might be useful if it was easier to setup, had a seperate remote, and had more processing power.  The kids never used it after it was setup because it required another device to control it and was kind of lost with the other simpler options available.  I eventually gave is away to my brother who is a tech junkie.Apple TV is better, but at twice the price.  I do like this one, though.  You can stream any content from your iPhone or iPad to the TV which the kids love.  The one negative which prevents me from buying another is it doesn't have the Amazon Prime app or a wide selection of other apps.  If I am going to pay for Amamon Prime, then the streaming device better have it installed.  The only plus for Apple TV at this point is its exclusive HBO Now app it enjoys for another 6 months or so.  Of course I like this because we don't subscribe to HBO through our cable provider.Either way, I hope this saves someone some time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shawn Mac \"Here and there.\""}]
