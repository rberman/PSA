[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have been using the fire stick last few days.  I am very happy that I have purchased the fire stick.  It is very fast, very good responsive remote (I don't have look for the phone like chrome cast though I am still using the chrome cast), games are nice and fun for kids.  I unsubscribed my Netflix and got amazon prime.  Amazon gave me $20 discount for fire stick but now, I am paying $100 for prime :(.  My only concern is streaming mp4 from internet via browser is not supported.  I need to buy AllCast software to do that which cost me about $5.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kuppa \"Kuppa S\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Horrible experience.

I decided to try the Fire TV Stick because (1) it also had all of the amazon prime streaming and (2) the pre-order sale put this under $20.  Thus far I'm pretty happy with it.  The interface is pretty fast and I've had minimal issues streaming content.  Having played around with the chromecast thingy, I think I like this more since it has a remote and can work standalone.  The only thing I see lacking at this point is a good app of iOS (which is supposedly in the works).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Chris Covel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far so good.

I found the setup to be easy and the intro video very helpful.  Picture quality is great.  It did require an immediate update when I plug it in on the 20th November.  If you do get one of these, be aware that you need to use their micro usb cable and power adapter for it to work properly.  That is fine, but I wish the micro usb cable was longer. (The reason why I am giving it 4 stars). Be aware of that when you are setting the fire stick up.  If you are looking for an inexpensive way to use video streaming to your TV, this is a very good option, however, I would think the Fire TV or Apple TV is better if you want to spend a little more money.I would recommend this device or Fire TV to anyone who does not have an iPhone or iPad.  The apple users may want to go to Apple TV due to the airplay capabilities.  Apple users can actually use there phone or iPad to play content from Amazon Video on their Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Joe Long"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I think this is a very cool product. Howeve,r there is very little new programming available that doesn't have a fee involved. I thought I would have more access to free programming or at least discount priced programming from some of the affiliated companies/ channels/ links. Still, it's a pretty versatile tool. Admittedly, I am new to this sort of thing.

Setup was a breeze, although I did have to reposition it to get the wireless connection to my router. After that it performed a software update before allowing me to connect.
