I have been trying the last week to watch a show on Netflix and it won't work. I then tried to watch something I Hulu and it won't work on there either. I reset my internet thinking that was the problem and still nothing. Will someone please give me more ideas on how to fix this?!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Raime Harvey"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "sucks too much buffering drops connection freezes. no problem with chrome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!!

Love the picture quality. I have a chromecast and three Roku boxes. Didn't think I would want a Fire TV stick. I got it free for signing up for 3 months of Sling TV. since I am a prime member and have been for years this was an awesome addition to my Gaget library. I have an iPhone 6. Not to many windows based apps play well with it. I was able to download an app that allows me to cast from my phone to the Fire Stick without an Apple TV, which I am not a fan of. Although I love my Roku boxes and don't plan to get rid of them I really think this Fire stick could go give Roku a run for the money. Overall I guess it's your preference. I happened to like this new channel line up I get with Fire in addition to all the content I have as a prime member", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CocoBees_Teaches"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "As long as you have a decent router  this will be great.  Our old router was making the picture really choppy, once we got a new one the shows/movies are smooth.  My kids like to watch some of the shows from Disney and Nickelodeon on this.  Although it would be nice if Amazon prime would have a few newer movies available.  Also one of the things I didn't know when I bought it was that I have to plug it in to an outlet as well as the TV, not a big deal if you have enough outlets close to the TV...I do not so I need an extension cord.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "itsnics"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Arrived quickly.

UI is fast and responsive, setup was quick and easy, and streaming is smooth. In fact, it really beats out the Roku UI.

I'm not a big fan of the way the interface works.  So far it keeps losing connectivity with my wifi network which sits on the other side of the bedroom wall and connects very well with computers, cell phones and the Roku box I also have.  Since I didn't have time to play around, I simply left it hooked up hoping to get back to it when I have more time.
