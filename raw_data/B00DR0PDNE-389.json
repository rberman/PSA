I am usually positive in my reviews, but the unit did not meet expectations. Only 720i and does not work reliably with iPad, or iPhone.  Worked well with my two laptops, but using Chrome on the iPad & iPhone it just stops displaying, or says \"not supported\". And it does not work at all with my network extender. I suggest looking around for a newer device design.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gerald P. \"GP\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love love love this device!
