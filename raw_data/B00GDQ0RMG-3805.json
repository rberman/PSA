We had been using cromecast, and needed another stick for our second tv. I feel like I have been able to watch the progression of the programming,  and I am hoping to see more improvements as time goes on.The stick is nice in that it consolidates my streaming apps, and has its own remote. The navigation is smooth and it is so easy to rent a movie when I cannot find it on Netflix or hulu.ButI feel that the stick does not play well with my wifi at times. Hours can go by without issue, but then it never fails in the heat of a scene the screen will freeze while the sound goes on. Sometimes I can rewind a few moments and hit play again to get things going, other times I have to exit and completely restart to get things going again. This is one thing our cromecast stick has not displayed as an issue with, otherwise I would blame the ISP.With all the improvement I have seen so far, I have no doubt that this little glitch is already being addressed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Zia"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "WORKS GREAT", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GARY SCHROEDER"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy, simple, inexpensive, and accesses everything I need.

Easy to install and the remote is practical and convenient to use.  Best of all you get all the prime videos and Netflix with one remote. My wifi medialink router is 40 ft. from my tv and so far no problem in receiving the streaming content.  If you have a tv with an hdmi outlet and you want access to streaming videos from Amazon and Netflix the fire stick is a must. The only problem I'm having is tearing myself away from the tv because of the easy access to so many videos.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "rmgza"}]
