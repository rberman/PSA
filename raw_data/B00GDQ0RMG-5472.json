I previously used chromecast and put this on one of my tvs in its place just to try. I love that it doesnt require my phone and can run on apps with the remote. Great alternative to cable as I can access netflix, my NBA league pass, prime videos, and  even get the news. Only issue is that it does not have a power button.. the stick just goes to sleep but always uses power.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kate B \"ktb\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "we are blown away with this little gadget.
