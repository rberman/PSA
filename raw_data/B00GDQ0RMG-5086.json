Now it can't seem to pick up my Wifi signal, although my Kindle in the same room can. Keeps asking for password,etc. I put it in & still doesn't work. Very disappointed. Purchased early and had to wait for it to come in. Very excited to the point that I was ready to purchase 5 more for my kids. If someone could make a suggestion on how to correct this problem, I would be most appreciative. Never had a problem with any other purchases from Amazon but very disappointed with this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joanne Jones"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Does not work in college dorms due to internet connection.
