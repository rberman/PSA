I was excited to get this. Our master bedroom was an attic originally and the cable/internet was never run to that room. We didn't want to pay the cable company to run cable up there so we got a roku which we've been happy with for about 2 years. Our oldest son decided he wanted tv in his room so we passed the roku to him and bout the fire stick. I can't speak for the quality of content or speed etc because it wouldn't connect to the internet. We tried many times, but it just wasn't strong enough to get on the signal. We put the roku back in and it worked fine so I'm positive it's not our internet. My advice is not to get this unless you can have it on the same floor as our router.***editing 6/28/2015*** changing my rating because after some research I decided to buy a wifi extender to boost our signal through out the house. My lazy self hadn't gotten around to actually printing the return label for the fire stick so I thought I'd give it a try. With the wifi extender in the same room it works perfectly. I'll stand by my original suggestion that if you're going to use this you need to have it close to your router (or an extender) but I'm changing it to 5 stars because it does work great and we are keeping it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rebecca Capone"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The only issue we have is the battery cover is almost impossible to remove.
