I got my son a Chromecast for his birthday because he said he wanted one over the Fire TV Stick. HA! Now he will only watch my TV and never uses his cumbersome Chromecast. I love that the Fire TV Stick app remote is available for my tablet and phone because the remote is small and I keep losing it in the couch cushions. My son loves the games that are available on it and we all love having our Netflix and Hulu at our fingertips. It is way more responsive than the Chromecast or our blu-ray player.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mary Waldo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

Way better price than Apple TV. Highly recommend. You can mirror your latop as well through an app that I believe was $4.

Was really excited and all was going well until a few hours later...  Received a system update that added a huge banner ad taking up a lot of screen real estate. Last time I checked it was ME who spent my hard earned money on your product.  Why the hell would you do this?  I'm in the process or packing g it up and I'm shipping it back.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "What a surprise. This thing is easy to install and my wife likes it. What else is there.It's easy just plug it in to an available HDMI port and it takes off from there. Follow the prompts and go and explore the features. If you do as I did - I walked away from my TV and when I came back it was in screen saver mode and publishing the most awesome scenic pictures from around the world. This is better than any screen savers on my computer.This would be great entertainment when company comes over and you don't want them watching TV but can cause a number of conversations.All I can say is I find the options and the number of TV episodes and free movies to be exactly what I have been looking for. The remote makes life real easy. So there you go.Great product Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Yvon Lemieux \"YankeeLover\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the Fire TV Stick!
