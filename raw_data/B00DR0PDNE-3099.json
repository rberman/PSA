It's very easy to set up and get configured. Once set up, your whole tv watching experience can be handled by your other devices (phones, tablets, and desktops). You really don't have to be technical at all to enjoy this device. Just follow the online instructions (all 3 of them) and start streaming what you'd like to watch on a bigger tv from one of the more active streaming services. The thing that would push this over the top is if Amazon Prime (and music) were included in the selection choices. (But I'll take what I have and very much enjoy it.)Overall, I really can't state just how happy I am with this experience.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"chayes34\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Facilitated the need for me to upgrade my stereo receiver AND my wifi!So after a forced upgrade of my equipment this little guy is running great!

The nice thing is once you start a \"cast\" from your phone to your TV you can even turn your phone off! If you are using a laptop you must have the Chromecast extension for the Chrome browser installed. This allows you to cast anything from the Chrome browser to your HD TV and the images look great! The Chromecast extension for the Chrome browser places a small icon in the top bar of your browser. You can then click on it to cast that tab to your TV and continue to work in other tabs without disturbing what you are casting. That means you can view TV Shows that view in your browser to your TV for others to watch while you work or read email etc. Of course, it works with HULU Plus and YouTube etc. 1/3 the price of Apple TV and ROKU and just as good if not better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "If all you want to access is YouTube or Netflix this is a great product.
