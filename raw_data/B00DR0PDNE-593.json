Also allows you to use the iPad/iPhone while casting videos. Does not drain the battery on the iPad/iPhone (at least it is not noticeable). 4 stars because more apps need to support chromecast and because the device sometimes times out (after several hours) and I have to force close the app.One word of warning: chromecast does need to be plugged in for power. Either via a USB cord, which plugs into the TV, or the AC adaptor. Just be aware of needing a power source", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JL"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GS"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": ":)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Very disappointed at this product.
