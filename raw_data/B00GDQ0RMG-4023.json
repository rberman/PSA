Purchased this so I could conveniently take my Amazon Instant Video with me when I travel.  Unfortunately, when I arrived at my hotel in Atlantic City and connected my Fire Stick TV, there is no browser to allow me to connect to the hotel WiFi.  So, this device is totally worthless to me since I have my PS3 and PS4 at home with the Amazon app on them.
