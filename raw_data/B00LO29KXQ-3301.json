I just can't figure out how they get all those movies and TV shows into such a little thing.Seriously, we recently cut the cord on Dish. Enough of the high prices for a lot of channels we never watched. We got an antennae for local and national broadcasts. We have Netflix. Signed up for Amazon Prime and got the Fire Stick. Pro-rating the cost of Prime and the Stick for 12 months and Neflix the costs is about $20.00/month. At that price we can splurge and rent a movie or two (although it will take me years to watch the free Prime offerings) and still be saving over $40/month.As for the Fire Stick, it's a no-brainer, especially if you have Prime. A no-brainer to install and a no-brainer to use. We bought one to begin with but ended up buying another. Although simple enough to switch from TV to TV, it was so popular with all the family members that I became tired of the  pouts when I exercised my maternal rights to control over the remote.We love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Granny K"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Easy set up and instructions, works well with my tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chelsea Sadler"}]
