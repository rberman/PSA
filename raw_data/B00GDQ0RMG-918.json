I have noticed that instead of buffering at the maximum speed from the beginning of a show, the stick will play at a lower quality right away, and then up-convert periodically as it is able to buffer during the show itself.  This results in a lower definition initial experience, as well as hiccups throughout the show as it converts to higher definition.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nicholas C.
