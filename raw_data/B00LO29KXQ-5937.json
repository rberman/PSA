[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Pretty fast and a lot of content, not to keen about the whole idea of being auto registered to my Amazon account. I do want to buy Prime, I have had accident by other users who have at multiple time registered me for Prime because they want to watch the content, I have been charged twice and am having to go and cancel the order several times. I use Netflix and that what I am sticking with, other then that the product is great. One more thing upgrading for Chromecast, it not very plug and play with apps on my phone, I am keeping having to use the remote which I totally hate to do (using the phone to play content is just more convenient as the phone is at you're finger tips all the time, or it's just me)!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "PabloPicasso"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Plug and play. Nice and easy to set up and use. My only issue as a prime member I would like more film choices. How about film category's? Also vintage films and documentaries would make the Fire Stick even more valuable. Come on Amazon show us the love!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "LarrySaunders"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I just got this and it was great that it already had my account information built in (like a Kindle).  However, the remote is completely non-responsive.  When I tried to navigate through the menus, nothing would happen.  I would try and try again.  Nothing.  Eventually all of the button presses would register at once and the screen would go nuts.When it did work, it seemed to work well.  But that was only a couple of minutes.Plus, maybe there is a way to skip it that I couldn't figure out (maybe the remote wasn't working??) but the introduction video is useless and annoying and much too long.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Dave"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy to have our Fire Stick! It's very simple to set up. Thanks, Amazon, for such an affordable streaming device that works!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Terry Miller"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My Fire TV Stick arrived today - not sure how I could buy it from BestBuy.com more than a month before it is available from Amazon, but I could. Great Apple-level elegant packaging. Beautiful interface. Almost all of the apps I cared about on Roku (this replaces my dead original Roku box - the first one Roku ever sold). It is well integrated with Amazon streaming, which I hoped/figured it would be. All of the songs I've downloaded and many of the albums I've bought from Amazon are instantly available to stream. I'm very happy with it and highly recommend it. It is the first piece of Amazon hardware I have ever bought - job well done, Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lisa H"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have used Fire Stick for 2 days and am very impressed with its ease of set up, remote response time, clarity and sharpness of videos and tv programs. The screen saver is full of beautiful scenery.  I uploaded Netflix and the video is sharper than when I watched it on my blue-Ray. Amazon Prime is the best value around. So much entertainment for so little money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ginica"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This would be a reasonable media streamer if it wasn't completely let down by abysmal wifi speeds.My first inkling of trouble was when attempting to connect to our network. I entered my password, and the stick spent several minutes \"connecting\", only to fail. The failure wasn't because of a bad password or anything like that; it actually failed to connect to amazon.com, This persisted until the third attempt.After the fireTV-for-dummies video was done playing, I proceeded to install the netflix and plex clients. The app menu was blank except for text; it took several minutes for the icons for the app to load, and about 15 minutes for the two apps.Netflix was a buffering mess. The plex client showed *no* image metadata for anything at any point, and took thee minutes to start playing the one movie I tried, only for it to buffer after 5 seconds of playing.There's nothing wrong with our wifi; a two year-old Nexus 7 is capable of doing all this and more from the next room with nary a hiccup, but the fire TV stick is incapable of doing pretty much anything from a distance of 3-4 feet with clear line of sight.The worst part about this product is that there must've been a whole team of Amazonians that signed off on the stick in its current state. More than one person at Amazon tested this thing and decided \"Yup, that's a shippable product; it's as good as it can possibly be.\" Either that, or they hold us users in such contempt that they thought we wouldn't notice. I'm not sure what's worse, to be honest.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Craig"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this stick!

I love the idea of casting apps to the TV, but the reality of it is broken, laggy, and unreliable. Having a physical IR remote is still the best way to instantly interact with your TV. It pretty much combines the best of ALL worlds (Chromecast + Roku + AppleTV = Fire Stick).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
