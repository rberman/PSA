The Fire Stick was so easy to set up, & it simplified the process of accessing Prime shows & Netflix. I can also access Prime music, & even buy music & movies with it.

I then installed the free app on my iphone and can now use that as a voice controlled remote.  So simple, so easy, so inexpensive.
