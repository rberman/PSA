Boy was I excited.I was going to stream from my new mac and iPhone, and mirror my chrome browser on my new LG tv from anywhere in the house.NOT!!!What a collasal piece of garbage.Very difficult to use without a remote, and when I cast my browser my mouse is invisible!! (Yes I know it's in beta)Picture is horrible.So unbelievably disappointed.Yes I read the instructions, troubleshooted, and studied multiple websites.This $35 waste of space is only useful for people without smart tvs who want to stream Netflix & YouTube. That's it.And when I tried Netflix, it never stopped. Nothing stopped the movie from playing.Since Apple TV looks disappointing too, I'm just going to buy a 50' hdmi cable and run it through the attic from mac to TV.Why can't these large companies swallow their egos and make something for the real world?Heed my advice!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "S.
