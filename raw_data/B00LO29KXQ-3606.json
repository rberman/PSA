There is no fix despite many people reporting the same problem.  The only recommendations involve \"reboots\" and those don't even work.

I purchased the Fire TV Stick to compare, and because I am a Prime member I thought it would be to my advantage.  My issues/opinions:- It doesn't stream as well as the Chromecast.  It is constantly pausing and loading where the Chromecast does not.  Using Netflix it paused so often that I took out the Fire Stick and put the Chromecast in - no more issues and I was able to watch the movie all the way through (I say that to say, it is NOT my WiFi)- I also find that having to plug it into the wall instead of the tvs usb a cord now has to be dealt with: where with the Chromecast I can simply plug it into the tv and no concerns about the wiring.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Video Corporation of America"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I ordered the Fire TV Stick in October of 2014 when they were first released for $20.

Was super easy and quick to set up and install. I highly recommend it! I dont have cable in my room so with my prime subscription I can enjoy a huge library of shows and movies now.

Thanks for such an awesome and affordable product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S. Philpott \"sabz\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "GREAT product.

It really is only useful if you have Prime.  The interface is fine and the device works but it is not customizable and it really doesn't fit with Apple share unless you buy the correct app.  I also hate the device for typing, so that's why I want to use my Ipad.  This probably would be WAY more useful for someone with a Fire device.  But, I am still happy with it because it does work just like advertized.  e", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "K.
