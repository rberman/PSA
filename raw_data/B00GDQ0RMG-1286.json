Once i stat navigating, it say no internet connection. I had Chromcast, it been working perfecting, with no connection problem whatsoever, i though i would switch to Amazon fire stick, it  guess it wasn't a good idea.

Great price! It's very small! And the best it don't get stock as the old device I had. The remote control is super. No to many buttons and look futurist.It is very easy to install and use.

I mostly bought this for netflix. But I love that it has so many more feature. The reach on the remote is really great, and I like that you can play games on it too!! I had Roku before this.

There are still too many TV channels that I don't want to give up. However, the Fire Stick makes me understand why people do indeed cut the cord.The device itself is slick, minimalistic, discreet and it works pretty well. Some individual apps (see: MLBTV) are absolutely useless, but I won't pin that on the Stick. We use it on our bedroom TV which only had an HDTV antenna at the time. Boy, we didn't realize how much we NEEDED this product. We've been a Prime family for several years now and the Stick just makes that $100 a year so much more worth it. We very much enjoyed watching Bosch and are knee deep in House of Cards now (via Netflix).There's just a ton of value here if you're a Prime member and you don't want to pay a monthly fee for an extra cable box in your bedroom.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "KennedyX8"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is one of the best investments I have ever made in my life. It is very small as I have mentioned in the title. It goes behind your TV in the HDMI spot and is hardly visible at all after you plug it in.What makes this stick extremely useful are obviously the apps that can be downloaded from the amazon store. Also, since this is an open platform you can also install third party apps which is what makes this the most slickest product to own in my personal opinion.A small issue I have with the product is that the remote is too small and you can misplace it and lose it frequently. But even this is negated by the fact that you can download an app on your smartphone to function as a remote and this app also has voice search features with a keyboard as well (which makes it easy to search for titles).At the price of $25 for which I bought it, I would say it is undervalued. You can definitely pay $29 for this product without a single second though or regret. I can promise you that this would be the best product that you would have ever bought in your life once you know how to use it according to your needs.Lastly, the OS is very fast and this is a very capable stick to make your TV extremely smart (maybe even smarter than you ;) )A MUST BUY FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS A TV (Even if it's already a smart TV)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nerukkadi"}]
