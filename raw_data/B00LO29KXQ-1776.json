It did not work at my home and I thought the internet connection may not be consistent enough. Took to my beach house where we have wonderful internet service through FIOS and it still will not stay connected to the internet. I am very disappointed in this and will be returning it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jodi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Amazon fireTv stick, one of the greatest releases of 2015.

I installed KODI and few other apps and it works like a gem. Only issue what i see is Youtube is bit slow (hangs sometime - may be internet issue) when accessing from Fire TV app but it was good when i access it using Kodi.Overall I am happy with this product. I was having Apple TV 3 earlier and although i dont find the smoothness with fire stick, it is easy to customize and install any apk app to it which makes the life easier.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Indira"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I didn't expect to have to pay for so many things.

I have DISH tv and my computer is ATT Uverse in home network for security.  How do I add this to my home network?  And the second question is, since I have Dish, do I turn on the tv and just turn on the Stick or do I have to go into another mode with my tv remote?
