No overheating issues and can be left running for eternity. Sometimes I have friends over, and we watch YouTube or Netflix together without any stutter in the connection. Pairs excellent with my phone and my computer.Buying this thing also gets you exclusive deals from Google like free movies and Play credit. In the end, I pretty much got my money back. Such a fantastic little device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
