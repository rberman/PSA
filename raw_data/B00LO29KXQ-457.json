Needless to say, the Amazon Fire TV Stick is more responsive and faster than the blu-ray player that I was using before. I'd definitely recommend this product to a friend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cole"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is awesome! I bought it for my daughter's room so she could watch cartoons, but it never made it past my room. I was setting it up and it was super easy. The instructions were very simple and I also had an on screen guide. It is very easy to use and I have all the video and tv apps I use right at my fingertips. I watch this all the time instead of satellite tv. if it weren't for my husband (and football), I would cancel my satellite subscription. I am extremely happy with this purchase and plan on buying another one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amanda A"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my Amazon Fire TV Stick! Great way to find something decent to watch when nothing is on!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Desie Custer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have to change/update my review because in a very gentle way, I was guided via chat on how to make the device work in every tv set in my household.  It would work properly in two different TVs, but fail in an LG, then the guy from TS showed me how to make the Fire TV Stick search for a correct configuration and all problems ceased.  I love Fire TV Stick, I love the resolution vs my smart tv`s own capabilities, now I have a new addiction!!!Incredibly, my fireTv stick arrived, I have been waiting sometime since I live outside the USA.  And when I plug it to any TV, any HDMI port I get a grainy screen that when not flashing white shown the fireTV stock logo and some instructions.  I have tried it in several TVs and same problem.  I hate to wait for days for an electronic and then have this kind of problems.  Now, sending it back will be a pain since I am not in the states and shipping it will cost more that actually buying a new one.  I hope I could load images so everyone could see what I am seeing right now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jaime R. Ortiz Ch"}]
