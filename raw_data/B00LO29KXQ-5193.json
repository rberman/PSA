Easy to setup and move from TV to TV. Love the Plex integration and Netflix profile functionality. While it has passwords to protect against kids purchasing things, it wouldn't be hard for a smart (older) kid to watch you enter the password once and remember it, but other than that, the feature is great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great!

I give it four stars for ease of use.  However, I have to take one star away for not being able to \"fling\" online content  from my laptop to the TV via the stick.  Since for example the Arte.tv app on the stick is not working, I wanted to stream from laptop to TV without having to occupy another HDMI slot (I only have three and they are all used).  This is disappointing. Apparently this is possible with the Chromecast.  Hopefully Amazon will fix this soon which will make the stick a major contender vs the Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sommersprosse"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Do not waste your money. I bought this because I was trying to decide between fire tv and a roku, I finally chose this one when I got the pre-order email. It seemed pretty cool at first but anytime I try to watch a movie I get the spinning circle to let me know it's loading. But it doesn't actually seem to load because I get this all through the movie. It's constantly dropping connection, this is the only item in the house that drops signal this often. It's a good thing it was only $20, otherwise I would be really mad.Again I can not emphasize enough, do not waste your money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Antonio Rodriguez"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I should send this back to Amazon.
