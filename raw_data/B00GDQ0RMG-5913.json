Johnson"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I have both Chromecast and FireTV Stick now and it certainly does not beat Chromecast. Chromecast lets you play local media without having to upload it to the web via Real player App. Also, the amount of apps on the Android Market that now have Chromecast capabilities are so much more then Amazon and lastly you don't have to be hooked up to the internet to use Android Apps. Those things make the lesser Chromcast a better buy. When i can cast my computer tabs or phone screen or whatever i want to Chromecast, its just so much more versatile, that puts it ahead of Firestick. For now Chromecast is still the winner. I am waiting for Matchstick to come in the mail and then i will see who wins that three way battle. Hopefully by that time FireTV stick has done somethings to make it better then Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Max"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "E.L."}]
