Has everything that I need- Netflix, Hulu, Prime, TWiT, Spotify (via my phone of computer) and, perhaps most importantly, Plex.It is so simple to use that my 83-year-old grandmother and toddler can both navigate it with ease. If my kiddo misplaces the remote, I can just use my smartphone.Better functionality than my now-outmoded Chromecast for only a few bucks more. Definitely worth it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mr. Splashy Pants"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I'm a big fan of the chromecast and have a roku, but am now a huge fan of the fire tv stick.  What it does out of the box is already great but once you tap into side loading apps like showbox,HD cinema, kodi, and Firefox browser this really makes it amazing.  If you're a cable cutter then this is the route to go. And my moga game controller was also compatible!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AdamB85"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works as advertised .
