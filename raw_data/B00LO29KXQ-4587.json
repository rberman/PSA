One of the main reasons I purchased this was the \"coming soon feature - \u2014take Fire TV Stick with you to use with HDTVs in hotels, college dorms, or anywhere with captive portal Internet access that requires entering a password or a log-in.\"  I ordered this way back in November or 2014.  When I called customer service earlier this month they had no idea what I was talking about.  When the rep put me on hold and asked around no one else knew about this feature or when it would be released.  I will change my rating when this feature is available or at least a release date.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "JeremyPDX"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am kicking myself that I didn't order more back in November!  This is by far the easiest streaming device on the market!  We have had google tv since the beginning and what a fiasco!  When it works it causes the cable to not work, this hooks up  and boom no problems!  We love it!  My husband hates TV, but I have him watching back episodes of the Blacklist and House of Cards!  Prime users need this!  It's awesome!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Deborah A.
