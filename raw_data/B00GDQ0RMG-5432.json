Easy to install.....comes with everything you need.  I bought it for a \"non smart\" several years old flat screen TV so I can watch Netflix etc.  All you need is an HDMI port to plug it in to. You do need wall socket electrical power, and what you need to access this is included. Plugging from Fire Stick to TV USB port for power probably won't work (cords for this NOT included anyway) since TV USB port probably won't give it enough to run.  After plugging in, it \"found\" me quickly, and in a minute, all was completed. If you are registered with Amazon, it will find you quickly as well. ALSO.....YOU DO NEED A WI-FI CONNECTION FOR IT TO WORK. LOVE IT!  In addition, the FREE Fire TV stick APP I got from Amazon App Store is great! I can control the stick from my Kindle or other device rather than using the included clicker. Well done Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SueofLWV"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This is not an ideal streaming device.
