[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was excited about getting this, and using it. However it is stubborn sometimes and doesn't work. I have to turn the TV on and off and take the stick out and put it back in about 3 times each time I want to watch something.I also haven't figured out how to scroll quickly through genres and such... and a lot of the things they offer are not things I would normally watch. However, that part is user error and lack of knowledge on my part.The three stars is because of the issues with getting it to work and it not working all the time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rebecca Hauptman \"rhauptman\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE THE FIRE STICK AND AMAZON PRIME!

Amazon Prime is already the best thing going, but being able to take ALL my movies anywhere there is WIFI (Which is virtually everywhere now) is simply fantastic.Its a breeze to set up anywhere. The interface is simple and intuitive to use.  And I LOVE that you can buy or rent a movie instantly.  So great for kids.I can put a Disney movie on for my daughter and her friends then switch to more adult fun when they crash.The Fire TV Stick is exactly the way I want to watch my entertainment.

I've been using for streaming Netflix and Sling TV and find the interface easy to use and quite fast. Excellent picture quality with my 50 mps internet speed.

Ease of set-up was great.  Daily use of the remote is just plain simplicity itself.  Using this now instead of the veryawkward blue-ray player set-up I was using.  This fire stick set-up has a 'fast forward' feature that really works remarkably well, as does the pause and resume feature.  Couldn't be happier with this.  Faster, easier, and intuitive.  Great value for the money too.  Absolutely and positively the fastest, easiest, and least expensive way to put streaming services on your TV.  Netflix plays particularly well on this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jrgawencki \"Flick Flack\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I purchased the stick as a compliment to my SLINGBOX, and the remote is not good for this at all.
