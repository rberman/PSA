It's fast, seamless and has everything we need since we \"cut the cord\" almost 2 years ago.We've had ours for 8 months now and still love it!People seem to think they only have Netflix & Prime on this device, but that couldn't be further from the truth. You can download dozens of apps like Hulu, History Channel, SlingTV, HBOGo, Smithsonian Channel and dozens of other apps that provide free movies and tv.When you get this device, do some exploring in the app section and you'll find dozens of great apps that will quadruple your viewing options past Prime & Netflix.  Folks brag about the Roku & Chromecast, but this device offers so much more.  Plus, none of these other media sticks offer any Amazon Prime media.  So IMO, the Amazon FireTV and FireStick win hands down.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.A.R. \"CAR85\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was fortunate enough to grab one at the special $19 price. The day it was installed, our Apple TV got put into retirement. Fire TV Stick has very few delays in streaming, whereas AppleTV had become really slow to respond. No complaints. Bought one at full price as a gift and it is well loved as well. My AppleTV is currently up on Ebay if you're interested, but I'd recommend you go with Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kristen Kidd Donovan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Life saver.
