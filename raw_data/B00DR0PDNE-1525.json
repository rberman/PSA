[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Sounds like a great device, but don't be fooled. It is very limited as to what it will actually broadcast and there is a definite lag for what it can broadcast.

Bought it on a whim and tried it out. Can't find a practical use for it. However, if you can pull it up on your computer or phone you can project it on the TV.
