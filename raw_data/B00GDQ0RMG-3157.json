However, within the first day of ownership it had become apparant how this great bang for the buck was possible... Its REALLY slow. The wifi my device is conmected to gets 10mbps download speed, more than enough for HD streaming on Netflix. However despite that, roughly every 3-5 minutes, whatever it is that I am watching on Netflix, stops... To buffer, sometimes for minutes on-end.Bottom line, this thing would be GREAT if only it had the strength that would allow it to do so.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "jacob edelman"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "definitely better than Net Gear I had, but does sometimes stop in the middle of longer running movies or shows", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Diane H."}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Slow, skips, freezes.
