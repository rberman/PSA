I just received the fire stix as a gift and was skeptical. How much TV can one watch - especially if your an avid Kindle reader? I must say ... I love this. Simple beyond words to install and a great library to chose from when you just want a classic or a movie missed. Performance is fast and so far not remotely \"glitchy\" as some have said. If your in the market for simple \"on demand\" viewing at very reasonable or no cost - I'd rate this a home run!

But when streaming videos through non-Amazon apps, the device freezes up more than occasionally.  For example, at least twice a week I will be watching a workout video on DailyBurn (supported by Hulu) and the video will freeze, with the Fire TV Stick and remote rendered inoperable.  Even after a \"hard reboot\" the problem is not always fixed.  Again, a lot of promise with this device, but some debugging is needed. I'm wondering if Google Chromecast or even the more powerful Fire TV would perform better, albeit at higher cost.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ricardo Arevalo"}]
