[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "If the standard Amazon Fire TV is a 5-star product, which I believe it is, this is a 3. Speed isn't consistent and I run into video problems with Hulu Plus. Still a great product and better than the Roku Stick but I would invest in the regular Amazon Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris L."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I'm giving this device 4 stars for 3 reasons:1- There are very \"few apps\" available2- It is not meant for usage outside of the USA/UK (thanks to all the licensing issues of the streaming content)3- Amazon needs to update it's support page and add Windows Phone. I have been able to completely mirror my screen of my Lumia Icon without lags, seriously Android devices lag more than Windows Phone for these matters.Overall, picture quality and interface is great.Well thought and designed.It supports Plex and is available to install from Amazon AppsStore, you can use it to stream your local media.I really wish installing apps from outside sources was a bit easier.Yes, I recommend it for both, using in the states with Prime or without it whether there or abroad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G.
