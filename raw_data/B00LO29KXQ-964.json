The streaming capabilities are great but it's not the super portable device that I believed it to be. There is a power adapter that is never really displayed in the advertisements. Is has to be plugged into an outlet so it's not as simple as just popping the usb into the port on the tv. Also, this is no fault of the Fire Stick, I bought to use on a tv mounted on the wall in by bedroom. I would have to take the tv down to insert the fire stick and then find another outlet to plug in the device.
