[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I was disappointed there wasnt more content available for customers who do not have an Amazon Prime account. It seems there would be thousands of programs to watch if you have prime but it wasnt made clear when it was purchased and seemed to me to be kinda self serving to Amazon. If i wanted prime i would have had it already, but i dont see spending 100.oo a year for content you can find elswhere. You also cannot access Nefflix or Huluplus without having those accounts activated as well. Seems the \"Free\" content isnt very abundant. Until i decide to get a Prime account, if i ever do, I now have another useless remote and something taking up one of my HDMI ports.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Kevin Aveyard"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use.
