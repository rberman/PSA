After a few patches its gotten better but it still isn't truly reliable.  It loses connection more than it should.  Apps crash for no reason at all and sometimes especially in Netflix the video has micro stutter meaning for about a second the image will freeze before playing again.  No matter what i do I can't fix it.  I've tried multiple routers I've tried signa boosters, different HDMI ports different TVs different USB cables for power...everything.  So its the device.If the device was $20 which is what I paid because I was a first wave buyer then it would be worth it despite the issues but at $40?  You are much better off saving money and buying a $25 chromecast.  I've never had any issues with a chrome cast and its easy enough that my mother who fan barely work a phone can use it.  In fact she likes it enough she bought a second one for her bedroom.  I bought her first.  She was going to buy a $100 box to do less so I jumped in and bought her the chromecast.  I figures the fire tv stick has too many issues and she would just get frustrated using it.-----original review below-----I got in on the first wave so my device arrived before Christmas and was only $20 so I can't be THAT mad about the bugs but I sure can post a review to warn you.The firetv stick has a bug in the way it handles WiFi.  This bug somehow causes routers to basically shut down.  It happens roughly 25% of the time I use the device which is only at night when I go to bed.When the device turns on and I load into say Netflix everything will appear fine.  I'll select a tv show and it loads up.  Then if I hit the show more episodes buttons POOF WiFi signal lost.  The problem is the WiFi signal is lost because the fire tv stick has somehow cause my router to crash.it also happens sometimes when loading the next episode and very rarely during an episode.  I'm using a premium level consumer router.  It has never had an issue before the firetv stick and the only time I have to reboot it is when using the firetv.It really makes zero sense.  I tried to report a bug but that was fruitless as amazon customer service just gave me the run around.  I have had this issue on 2 routers both from Cisco.  Both routers have the latest firmware as does the firetv stick as of 1/12/2015.Rebooting the router is a hassle as it requires me to.go back downstairs.  Its not a deal breaker but be warned it can happen and will make you curse this device.Other than that glaring issue its good for the price I paid.  It plays basic games and runs media apps I use to watch tv in bed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Steve \"teamparadox\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "worked seamlessly.
