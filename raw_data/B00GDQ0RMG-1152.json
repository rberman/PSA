I have a Samsung tv with Netflix but I prefer the version of Netflix on the fire stick. Plus you get amazon prime movies, shows, music, and all kinds of other tv station apps to watch free tv. Really can't beat it for the price", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Mitch Conner"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought this during the \"big sale\" because my fiance' kept raving about how it was awesome and he wanted one. I have come to love it as well. Very easy to use. No issues using it with the remote. I use it with my Samsung 46 inch TV and it works perfectly. I can play my Amazon music that I purchased through the app that is installed on the stick and have mini concerts in my room. I can watch all the Amazon Prime videos and the instant ones. I think for the price paid, it was a great investment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Keedyboo"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "What's with the screensaver activating while I am watching a movie???", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Alex"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great way to view prime video, digital purchases, and listen to music via amazon music", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "jt"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works very well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

I think because I now have so many devices hooked up, the system gets confused and it takes a bit of time to sort it all out. But the good thing is that more than one person can use the AMAZON Prime viewing at the same time (different shows, different viewing pleasures). That was my overall goal, so these Fire Sticks have been a very nice addition.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got this as a \"surprise\" gift for my bf who loved it!!! He had been wanting one so I got it. Great price!! I think it was $39. We have been able to see movies with great clarity and saved so much money!!
