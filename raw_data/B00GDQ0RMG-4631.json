Super easy set up & since I am a faithful Amazon Prime user, this is the best way to get shows/movies to stream to your TV rather than just on your mobile device.

This is the second Fire Stick I've purchased. I love the quality and the ease of setup. Works first time and every time. The quality of the unit is obvious and the intuitive nature of using the controller is a major plus. It simply does what it says it's going to do and it does it perfectly.

I just don't understand why it still needs to be plugged into 110 power source, Most TVs now have USB and I would think there would be a viable way to source the power to the stick via USB to prevent unnecessary cords from hanging down, especially since it puts undue stress on the HDMI port. 5 start if this \"problem\" is resolved, at least provide us with a longer mini-power cable so the TV doesn't have to be 4 ft. from a power source.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dadelous"}]
