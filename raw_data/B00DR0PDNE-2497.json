(I had an older desktop, and a Samsung chromebook.)  Supposedly Google is going to to add support for my type of Chromebook, but right now the Chromecast only works well with the Pixel.  I think most newer desktops should be able to handle the Chromecast; my new desktop now handles it just fine.Compatibility issues aside, the thing works pretty well.  I haven't had any buffering issues at all.  I do wish there was some way to set the thing to autoplay through a tv season on Netflix though, so I didn't have to manually tell it to go to the next episode every time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kristopher \"ekristoph\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Have trouble staying connected to wifi.

I have primarily Apple devices, a MacBook Pro and an iPhone, but I also have an old Google Nexus 7, 1st Gen. and I'm grateful that I have it for using it with the Google Chromecast.Pros:The video quality is great. I have really terrible internet service and this still works. I was pretty weary about it but this confirms that it was nothing to worry about. I probably get like 2-3 Mbps.I love HBO Go! I use this primarily for this service and it works like a charm. You can also use it as a cheap Sonos alternative for streaming music [...] .Additionally, Google just released the SDK so many more apps will be available soon!Cons:Not many apps work from Apple products and not as well as they do from Android products. Go figure.Would I still buy it?Actually, I now own two and use it as my main streaming device after using my blu ray player for many years.
