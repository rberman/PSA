It was easy to install and it is faster to use than my other streaming device. I can use Netflix and my Amazon Prime on it, plus it has options for photos and other things that I haven't used yet. Some things that I didn't like was that the writing is so small on the screen for the descriptions of the movies that it is hard to read; and the other thing is that when you stop in the middle of a movie and come back to it later, it doesn't show you where you left off. But I would still use it over my other device because it is faster and so easy to use. I would recommend this device to anyone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JFF"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to set up. Works great.
