I had a blue ray player that was streaming capable and it was so slow.  The Fire TV stick is lightning fast and has a ton of content.  Some are subscription based, others are free.

My wife and I use this on a wall mounted 42\" LED in our bedroom (mostly because we have the Fire TV in the livingroom) and could not be more happy. They really shouldn't keep secret all the amazing things that it can do, like side loading OnLive and using it as a $2000 gaming PC. I could list awesome possibilities for this device until i'm out of available characters but the bottom line is if you don't have one of these, buy one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works well and easy to setup.
