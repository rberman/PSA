I've reset the network connection, unplugged it, disconnected it, still won't connect!  All my other devices are connecting fine so it's not my network.

However very restricted unless you get apps that are unethical to use. I have the kindle fire hdx7 as well, same thing there. Terrible user interface except for shopping. Just what we all need is another os to learn. Silk browser is not very users friendly, however I have to be fair. Until I use it for a longer period of time, I will be open minded, I would not buy Kindle products again though, I would definitely stick with ANDROID BASED (my opinion only)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "TW"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am totality pleased with my new Amazon Firestick!!!!
