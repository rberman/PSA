Wi-Fi setup was a breeze....My Netflix and Hulu Plus was easy to register. Netflix movies start up quickly no more waiting for stream time. I'm an Amazon Prime member so I didn't have to do anything for the Amazon movies, it was an automatic register... again movie start up is quick, no waiting on streaming.....I ordered from Amazon and being a prime member I didn't have to register fire stick as it is suppose to be automatic....Hope that is true as I have nothing letting me know the status.I'm using the power cord and adapter supplied and recommended. If you buy this item you won't be disappointed...To you out there who don't think you can do this task, relax, it is a very simple set up. As usual Amazon comes thru again.............", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing product makes watching movies very easy and is simple and easy to set up and use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Grant Albers"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Gwendolyn White"}]
