Another problem it has is when it goes to sleep, it doesn't wake up.

I've been through a couple of hours of time on the phone with your techs at level 1 and 2 (your websites recommended method of contact BTW) I still have the problem. THE ISSUE IS NOT WITH MY BANDWITH ; YOUR TECHS  SAID THAT. ACCORDING TO YOUR LEVEL 2 TECH, THE ISSUE IS THE PROXIMITY OF THE FIRE STICK TO THE TV. OK, WILL THE FIRE TV WORK BETTER?  YOUR SALES DEPT TOLD ME THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE OR I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THAT.  SO SEND ME A FIRE TV, BUT BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE SO FAR, DON'T EVEN THINK OF CHARGING ME. THEN I MIGHT BE SATISFIED....IF THE DAMN THING WORKS. BTW THAT SAME TECH TOLD ME THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON EXPERIENCE.
