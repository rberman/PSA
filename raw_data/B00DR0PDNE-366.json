I purchased this one for use in my classroom at church.

The amount of times I have had to reset BOTH chromecasts due to issues is ridiculous. It constantly disconnects from my router for no reason, even after I optimized it. I had to optimize it by sitting with google on the phone for hours. Then I come back home to my apartment complex. If you live in an apartment complex where you cannot reach the router or change its settings, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It never worked due to connection issues, and when i called google for tech support they told me they cannot refund my money. I highly advise looking for alternative products on the market. I love google but I have never in my entire life had such a bad experience with a product continuously. I tried ROKU instead, worked instantly with no problems. Please buy any other product on the market, not this horrible \"BETA\" product.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin Thomas"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's great when it doesn't freeze up.
