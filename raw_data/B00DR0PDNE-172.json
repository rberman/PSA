I didn't know devices like this existed!So, I'm a huge fan of watching movies on my laptop, but I get tired of looking at the tiny screen. This amazing device allows me to play whatever movie is going on my laptop onto my television! It gives instructions on how to connect everything, but once you're set up you can pretty much do anything on your laptop and have it screen on your TV.Also, if you have google play (not sure if it works with other music apps/sites, never tried it), you can connect your google play app to your TV using your chrome cast. Now you can play your music even louder!Definitely worth the price of this product. Highly recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "#teamiphone6"}]
