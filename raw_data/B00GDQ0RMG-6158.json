I got the Fire TV stick on release day. Set up was super simple; I think it went from the box to playing movies in less than five minutes. Navigation is fast and smooth; I haven't experienced any of the lagginess some of the tech blogs have complained about.The only issues that keep it from a full 5 stars:1. Netflix isn't available out of the box, rather it is an app that must be downloaded. Not a huge problem, but it is advertized as being right there from the start.2. No iOS remote app (yet). I know Amazon is working on this so I'm not too worried here either.3. The pin system needs work. I get the idea of security and keeping kids from making unauthorized purchases, but this current pin system is janky and annoying.All in all the Fire TV Stick is well worth the money, especially for Prime members like me. To have a device so polished and feature-rich on release is a pleasant surprise. I can't wait to see what Amazon has planned for the Fire TV Stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shawn Fanchette"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Met all of my expectations.

Quick, great Amazon video integration, intuitive interface. Set up is extremely easy, and the search function is phenomenal. I still wish somebody would create integrated search that would search Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Instant video at the same time. Anyways, I love this product. Would definitely buy again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Kyle Marquardt"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Disappointed to find out that most of the shows I want to watch are not free with Amazon Prime.
