(It especially comes in handy when there are certain shows you can't stream because of Hulu's guidelines.)The only \"complaint\" I have is that sometimes my laptop and TV/Chromecast don't talk to each other or sound is missing.

Two things I highly recommend to do this are XBMCast and the Avia app.  Google the first, the latter is in the Play Store.  With these two things (total one time cost about 8 dollars), the content available to stream from your Android phone or table is wide open utilizing the '1channel' addon in XBMC.  There's also a lot of talk on the town in the past week of a roll out for Google Play Services that will add the function to 'cast screen' to certain tablets and phones.  A partial list slated for the first rollout includes the Galaxy line of phones and the Nexus 7 2013 and the Nexus 10.1.  When this talk becomes reality, this will absolutely be the best value in streaming devices on the market, hands down.
