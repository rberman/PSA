Much better than the Chromecast we purchased last year. We have added a Amazon Prime membership and a Netflix account and love it so much we are getting rid of cable. The remote control is kind of cheap feeling like others have said but we use the app on our iPhones to control it anyway. I would recommend the Fire Stick and cutting cable all together!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rick byrd"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Ok I just got this and LOVE it...it was easy to install...made my TV images much clearer...and I can get to all my tv programs and movies way faster.
