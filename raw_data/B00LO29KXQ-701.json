I also like the available app for the I-phone which can be used to speak the commands allowing you to use that as the remote in place of the one that came with the device. Great purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Trixie365"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I like it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angela"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Louis C."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David L Pursey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Boake Moore"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought this as a Christmas present for my mother.

However,it caused MLB tv to black us out when we were not in a blackout area. It also quite a bit of buffering although it usually lasted a short time. Except for using it for MLB I would recommend it We have had the stick about three weeks. It was easy to.install and worked right away.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MEREDITH MARTIN"}]
