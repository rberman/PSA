[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great features for the low price. It has more features than an Apple TV, but Apple TV has a smoother feel and fast internet connection. The Fire TV stick has a lot of lag with video. I'm on a 60 mbps connection and the Apple TV never buffers, but the Fire TV does. I eventually switch back to the Apple TV because the low res buffering is too much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dillon Hafer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great with my TV and wireless router.

Very fast response time, good remote, although if I were to purchase another Fire TV I'd go with the box as it has a better feel to the remote and you can do a voice search on it and you can't on the stick.  Other than that it works great, fast, easy to install, and maneuver around in and I really like that I can upload family photos (unlimited) and Videos to amazon and view them on my Fire TV.  I also like that I can use the Prime music library with it.  I could do the photo's (not video) with Picasa and the Roku but it wasn't as fast loading the pictures over the wifi.  I'm not a game player but I'm sure my grandkids will like being able to play games when they are here, just need to get the controller thingy for it.Yes, I'm trading my loyalty from Roku to Fire TV, sorry Roku.  I've loved my Roku's but the Fire TV is so much better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Mema \"Wife, Mother, Mema, Sister\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I started my streaming experience with the short-lived Logitech Revue (a Google TV device). I really liked the interface and functionality but it was a pain to setup and I found I had to reboot it quite often (it's now connected to the kids TV in the basement and they like it). Then I got a Roku streaming stick which I also like - nice interface and works well so no complaints. Finally got the Fire TV Stick and love it - it was super easy to setup, it has a very nicely designed remote control and interface, a decent selection of app's and obviously works brilliantly with Amazon services (instant video, prime music, prime photos, etc).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gareth"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Please make a app with a very simple web page for business travelers to log into hotel WiFi.
