The apps are limited and of poor qulity.  See my review on the Show Anytime app.  Amazon needs to put quality first and this is in testing all apps and services first. Think Apple here folks.  I would pass on this device until Amazon focuses on the apps and streaming services for this device.  Get a top line Roku instead.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "An  M.K.

It is everthing it is advertised to be.  It was really easy to install & there is an excellent selection of movies & TV with Amazon Prime.  I love the voice search, I really had doubts that it would work as well it was advertised, but it is very easy & efficient.  I have not tried any of the other services since I am so happy with the selections offered by Prime.  I may in the future but it will take me a long tiime to work my way through my watchlist with what I have currently chosen to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J. K.
