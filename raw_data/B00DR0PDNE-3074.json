However, if it does end up working for you (which it most likely will) then you're golden.Let me say that my most used apps are Netflix and YouTube, which makes the Chromecast ideal for my set up.People will complain that the Chromecast doesn't do everything; obviously it doesn't. But for $35, it does A LOT.Devices such as the Apple TV and the Roku will in fact do more with much more developed app support.But let's just remember how long those devices have been out in comparison to the Chromecast.Give it time, the Chromecast will catch up.Suffice to say, the Chromecast is in its infancy. It has been out for roughly 6 months now, and not much has changed.Yes, a recent update brought a bevy of new apps, but in many ways, the Chromecast has not changed much.But that doesn't mean that the Chromecast is bad--if you take away anything from my review it's this: The Chromecast WORKS.As far as actual performance, your mileage may vary. For me, I have a pretty good internet connection so streaming is pretty good. Buffer times are good and the displayed content will switch from 360p to 1080p fairly quickly.Quite honestly, this was one of my favorite purchases of the year.

Seemed to work pretty good to begin with, a few bugs here and there. Then they ran an update.... Now the stupid thing is practically worthless. It works one time before I have to unplug it to reset. I returned it for a new one thinking it may be defective, same thing. Once I cast something, it runs, but I loose all control after several minutes. It says that the unit is not on the same network as my iPad.
