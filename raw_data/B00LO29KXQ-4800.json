I use it mostly for watching videos on amazon prime. But the biggest problem I have with this is the limitation of apps. I wish there was some kind of screencast where I could cast videos or pics from my laptop and my phone. I like Chromecast better in that matter.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "sandeep"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "awesome especially once you ad tvmc to it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Travis Faul"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I like the fact that we can watch movies when we want to.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Barbara Scheuren"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I am a little disappointed with the Fire TV Stick because I cannot get it to mirror my smart phone.

Love the simple remote and navigation on the t.v.  Hate the buffering while watching things but that's with my internet.  The four stars is because of the lack of free shows/movies with Prime.  Disappointed that I could only get first three seasons of True Blood.  REALLY disappointed that I cannot watch regular channel shows unless I want to pay $3 for each episode.  That's $12 a month just for one month of one show like Scandal or Grey's Anatomy, ect... If I am going to pay $100 for another year of Prime, I should get at least the basic channels for free so I won't be renewing that and will be adding HuluPlus or Netflix so I can cancel my Dish.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lulupam"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was an early adopter of Chromecast, and a completely satisfied owner of three until a few months ago when updates made the old Droid 2 phones I was using as dedicated remotes obsolete for Hulu and Netflix.  The Firestick solved all those problems immediately with its apps and remote.  I do not have to worry about further updates either.  The price difference between the two is more than compensated with ease of use and extended capabilities.  I'm getting so much more from this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "elicovington"}]
