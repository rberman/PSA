I would just lightly tap the remote and it would jump all over the screen and randomly select a bunch of items. Very frustrating when trying to navigate or play a game. Tried resetting it, but that didn't work. I think that actually made it worse. Ended up  returning it. Now that I read a few pages of the reviews on both the FireStick and Regular Fire TV, sounds like most of these systems are having this issue. If amazon fixes all the kinks and glitches, I would buy another one and sign up for a prime account.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Not Happening"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Biggest issue is that there is no VPN app capability. I mean, I have a very portable device that I cannot use outside the U.S.  I'm a Prime Member, so I have paid Amazon for this service, why won't you build in the ability for a VPN. I can watch Amazon streaming video through other devices with a VPN app....why not the Fire Stick. The only use I get from the Fire Stick is Hulu Plus and Netflix (non-U.S.). And because the Fire Stick still connects to the WiFi, I cannot use any mirror app, which would be extremely useful. Additionally the Fire Stick is very glitchy. Not sure why, and it's not the WiFi, but often the picture freezes or the app drops off.  I have to unplug the Fire Stick, it resets, and then it's good for only a short while.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Risk2210"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Nice little gadget to add to a non smart tv, quick interface and loads fast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Edgar"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Nice.
