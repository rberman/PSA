[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "1 Star because of its wi-fi issues. My friend has the Fire TV (not the stick), and I have to admit, it is an amazing device. And I was hoping this device would be just as great. There are a lot of great apps, even more than on the Roku. With this device, it took a while to find my router even though it is only about 10 feet away. Then when streaming, it keeps on buffering and the connection doesn't seem that stable. My Roku, has no issues streaming. Another thing I do not like about this device is that it requires external power to work. I have a new TV and I can't use the USB on the TV to power it. I would suggest staying away from this product until they fix the wifi issues, unless you like watching choppy video.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ryan Rytlewski"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "\"The hit\" of all of our christmas presents!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

There are just a few hiccups, but since I was able to purchase this for $20 (I think) as part of the Amazon Prime promotion, I can't really complain.  The interface is easy and once the stick was set-up (a very easy process) we were able to start enjoying our online content asap.  My few complaints are, no HBO access, but I understand that is coming soon in January, the cumbersome screen keyboard (it takes FOREVER to enter searches, type, etc.) and on occasion, the WiFi craps out and you have to re-enter the password to your router.  Other than that, it's been a great return for just $20.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mafreund \"mafreund\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is amazing, you can install XBMC player for more fun than the apps already installed..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Blot League"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to install for us non techies.

I do own all three and I find each has their pluses and minuses. When it comes right down to it, here is how I would rank them: Roku3, Chromecast, Fire TV Stick. The reason Roku gets top billing from me is because of all the channels it has. One particular is BYUtv. I cannot cast this channel with either the Chromecast or fire stick. Chromecast is second because I can cast almost anything to it using my phone. The little remote that comes with the fire is OK but if you lose it, the fire tv won't work. It just sits there on startup saying \"searching for remote\". Fire TV is good if you use amazon prime video, it's obvious that it caters to their product. The \"cast\" feature doesn't work but it may be something goofy with my TV because I use it on the same tv as my roku3 and I can't get the mirror screen feature to work on it either. They both may work on my newer TV.*************3/10/15 - UpdateI am not sure why but the cast feature does not work. I tried it on my newer TV that the Chromcast works fine on. Since the original review, I don't use the fire stick at all. I use the Roku3 on one TV and Chromecast on the other. IF I had amazon prime and didn't have the other devices I would probably use it much more.*************3/27/15 - UpdateI am not sure if there was an update of some kind but I am now able to stream video to the Fire TV Stick and Roku3 just like I was able to on the Chromecast. Because of that, I bumped my review up to 4 stars.The Chromecast still responds a lot faster to streaming from a device (phone/tablet/laptop) than the other two but I wanted to state that I am able to stream to all three devices now. I still favor the Roku3 and Chromecast though. If I had Amazon prime I would probably use the Fire TV Stick more. I forgot to mention in my original review, I really do like the HDMI extender cable that comes with the Fire TV Stick. When you have a lot of devices/things plugged into the back/side of your TV it is nice to not have to try and cram this in the small space. it allows it to hang outside at any angle to fit better and if for some reason it gets bumped, you don't have to worry about the Fire TV Stick or your HDMI port getting damaged.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J Peterman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Does what I wanted", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
