The picture (even on my 60\" screen) and audio (I have a digital audio cable leading from my TV to my receiver) quality are in line with other streaming options.  However, the big downfall to this product is the ASAP delivery of your preferred content.  I was contacted by my provider about the dramatic increase in my bandwidth usage and was close to exceeding the monthly cap, which I wasn't truly aware of before, after only a WEEK of using the Stick at the end of November.  I work remote frequently, via a highly secured VPN, and have used multiple Apple TVs in the house for years without ever being close to the bandwidth cap.  Again... one week with the Stick and I was about to start shelling out for overage fees.  For the first part of December I just looked and was shocked to see it had already taken me to 25% of the cap for this month!  I don't even use the Stick daily!  Amazon needs to offer the option to turn off the ASAP delivery of content.  Maybe then I'd give this three or four stars....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "M.

You can AirPlay music, pictures and videos to the Fire Tv with Airbuddy, a fire tv app. The fire tv stick is very responsive and quick to load content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nichole Montague"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works fine - but I was suprised that is had to be plugged in to an outlet.  I was expecting it to be more like the Chromecast in that manner. Also it is very difficult to open the battery section of the remote.  Had to Google to figure out what to do and quickly realized that others had the same experience. As far as the operations, it seems to work pretty well and the remote is a little easier to navigate than the Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ww"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Hello fire stick goodby chromcast", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Davis"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Are more apps coming to this product, such as Xfinity or TWC apps?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Thomas Rookstool \"trwv\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Got it as an Amazon prime member and I think its great for the prime membership, however there is just one big problem. When watching TV or movies we get an occasional pop or screech in the audio, the video will go black for a few seconds while audio plays, then other times it will flicker on a off then just show white noise like an old TV set. One morning it just went to white snow and I just switched back over to my apple TV.
