[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have a Samsung H6201 Smart HDTV I purchased during Black Friday along with this Amazon Fire stick. Like everyone says, wifi connectivity is an issue. I actually was able to get mine to work pretty well with wifi after a couple days, my issue that has never been resolved is apparently a TV compatability issue. I get a distinct double image which from afar looks like a blurry image. The screen test on my tv shows a normal image, so its not the pannel. No matter which HDMI port I use, double image, oh and a green bar across the entire bottom portion of my screen. Aside from that, my TV menu shows a double screen on the same input as the fire stick. when removed, double image goes away. when switching to whater HDMI port my blu ray player is on, no double image... back to firestick input, double image and green bar.  I am actually able to get rid of it about every 5th time i reset my TV to factory settings, but as soon as i turn the tv off and on again, back to double image and green bar. Samsung is sending a technitian over to take a look at it.  Not sure its worth having my tv gutted out for this. Im hoping for a firmware update SOON to fix this issue. Very frustrated.  Time wasted so far to get this thing \"operational\"= 10+ hours. Too bad amazon content is so hard to get on streaming devices.To note: on my acer computer monitor there are no issues. On Vizio E series 48 inch (no smart functionality), no display issues either. I chose the samsung 6 series for its superior pannel and overall image quality, jokes on me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/8", "author": "Camila"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's fast and very easy to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shannon E.

I originally purchased a google chromecast as my apple TV was on the decline but found it to be clunky, slow and difficult to control without a remote. This on the other hand is fantastic! It does exactly what I needed and at a way better price than purchasing any of the other similar products. I would absolutely recommend this product and will likely purchase another.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I bought this one in order to replace my Chromecast. I mostly use those streaming device to watch Twitch TV. Therefore, when I heard Fire TV Stick has Twitch TV build-in app, I was quite excited. However, I just figure out that it is not as good as it advertised.Twitch TV apps on Fire TV Stick is a disaster, it just only shows video quality as 480, meanwhile Chromecast is 1080. Hopefully it will improve soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Wynter"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Loved it! Easy to navigate through and find favorite TV shows & movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cozi"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Very disappointed. All set up and connected and according to the fire tv stick, the signal strength is 'very good'.  When I try to actually watch a movie or listen to music though, I get a message that I'm connected, but with problems. Optimistic me, I think \"Ok, I can work with that.\" Only, there's no troubleshooting option available to me on the device. Tried the advanced settings, which only takes me back to the available networks screen. Called Amazon to find out how to return it and the VERY pleasant person (no sarcasm here - really nice) I reached wanted to troubleshoot with me. Okay, sure. I'm agreeable to that. When the 'tech' troubleshooting doesn't work I'm offered a replacement device. Again, I'm agreeable. However, I will have to wait until my 10 year old turns 18 (yes, a bit of an exaggeration because I have no kids yet, but you get the idea) to get the replacement device as there's a backlog. Really??  Well, to say I'm disappointed in Amazon's new device would be an understatement - (I didn't even get to mention the limited app options. However, full disclosure, I would not be bothered by that if the thing actually worked.) This was my first venture into purchasing an actual amazon-created device. It will be my last.  I realize that my experience may be the anomaly.  So, I hope you all have a better experience than I've had. My device is being returned and I'm looking into a roku instead. Still love Amazon for purchasing other peoples' products though! In fact, I will probably purchase my roku from Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "230/258", "author": "Customer 2"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "S\u00faper", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "cesar guillen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to setup, already synced to my Amazon prime account out of the box.
