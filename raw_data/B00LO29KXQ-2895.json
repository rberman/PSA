Its built sturdy, and includes a bunch of stuff to make useage easy on almost every tv without additional hardware. Its compact and works with my sony tv remote as well as my android phone as a remote. The included remote is intuitive and compact.

Jokes on me! Amazon is knowingly selling a device that doesn't do what they claim. The help forums are full of people with this same problem and they're is no fix.It connects, maybe 8 percent of the time. I even tried with my Fire HDX. Probably 5 percent with that.  It just says that it is connecting or discovering, then it just quits. I've tried resetting all involved. I've cashed customer support.
