For the difference in price, I would have gone with the Fire TV stick in both locations had I known then what I know now.  The Fire Stick works perfectly and we are able to watch shows on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus, as well as play Pandora radio.  That is all we really do through our streaming devices.  For $39, I think the Fire TV Stick is a bargain and would also be very easy to take with us when we travel.  I highly recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "OT in NC"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!
