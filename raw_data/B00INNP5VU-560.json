I have two!  With this, Netflix and Amazon Prime I save about $700 a year over basic expanded cable.  Great deal!  Easy set up (not as easy as plug and play, but still under 20 minutes).**** This is an update from a previous review of the RUKO 3500R streaming device.One of my RUKO 3500s began to over heat and lockup.  After a about two+ hours of watching  RUKO, it lockup. Heat seems to be the culprit.I have two, one on 110v wall plug and one powered on a USB port.  The USB powered one never over heats, so I am trying the other one for a few days on USB power also.  Hopefully this solves the lockups/stalls/loops.I spent an hour waiting for a real person and 30 minutes in a live chat session with RUKO support.  The guy(person?) was clueless.  I mean he should quit tech support and start working as an online exercise instructor.  All he did was get me to walk back and forth to my TV 15 times. (TV is 30ft and out of line of sight from computer)What a waste of time!  Hopefully my USB power fix works or I will have to find another solution for expensive cable, because RUKO on 110v AC power is not working.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jim"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "1st thing that happened was that Roku \"REQUIRED\" a credit card for registration even though they said they would never use it unless you needed to pay for something.  Very tacky and created a sour taste within 5 minutes of recieving it.  I purchased the Roku for my brother because he did not want Comcast and Roku boasted about nearly 1,000 TV channels.  Yes there are many channels but none that we ever heard of with content we did not care about.
