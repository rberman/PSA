You either have to rent or buy movies to use the fire to the fullest. Disappointed with this purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/4", "author": "Mrs. M"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I bought the Amazon Fire TV for $99 and after about 6 months I was very disappointed with the quality of the Fire device which I received.  On top of the fire tv device, I  ordered a Kindle before and wasn\u2019t incredibly happy with both devices.  My Kindle froze many times and I had to exchange it for another one.  The same thing happened with my Amazon fire device when my remote stopped working and I had to order another one.  Be very careful when ordering hardware devices from AmazonAfter ordering the Fire TV device and having to replace the remote control, I\u2019m very hesitant on ordering any hardware devices from Amazon.  It doesn\u2019t surprise me that Amazon is now charging $39 for the same device which I paid $99 for due to the fact that obviously their product quality is either deteriorating or has been below mediocre since they started trying to sell hardware products.  Due to all of these problems with their hardware devices, I never ordered the fire phone which Amazon came out with a few months ago, and I haven\u2019t heard about since then, probably due to the fact that Amazon\u2019s hardware devices\u2019 are way behind in terms of quality compared to their competitors like Google and Apple.I haven\u2019t seen an advertisement for the Fire phone since about June 2014 and it is now almost January 2015 which means that Amazon not only has been lowering prices on it\u2019s already existing hardware devices, but hasn\u2019t even continued to advertise it\u2019s \u201cup and coming new\u201d hardware devices.  Instead, it seems like, Amazon has taken a \u201cbackwards\u201d approach and decided to lower it\u2019s prices on it\u2019s already existing hardware devices such as Amazon fire stick, and fire tv devices, and discontinued it\u2019s sales of devices such as the fire phone.The main point of this entire blog is that if you are a company which stands behind it\u2019s services and continues to deliver great services and tries to compete with other companies to deliver great products, than deliver great PRODUCTS.  Don\u2019t think that because you have a good market for your services, that your products will automatically be bought by the same market.  For example, I think that Amazon\u2019s services are still somewhat okay, but I think their products are below mediocre.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/4", "author": "Martz"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "If you are a sheep and 90% of you are buy this.
