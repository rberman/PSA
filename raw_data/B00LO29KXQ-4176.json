Since I don't do things by half measure (ie extension cord), I'll have to have a receptacle installed. The length of cord is fine if there is a receptacle at standard height (15\" off of the floor) and directly to the right of the TV. Thank goodness I'm married to an electrician but others won't be so lucky and are looking at $150, easily, to have a receptacle installed.

I think they made it very user friendly and highly recommend this as an alternative to additional cable TV add-on channels that are usually costly.
