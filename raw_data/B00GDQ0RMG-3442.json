[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.  I have Apple TV and I have to say, as the BIGGEST APPLE FAN TO EVER EXIST (that means I have owned more Apple products than 99.999% of the population) that I like Fire TV Better.  Sorry Apple.  But you TOTALLY dropped the ball on Apple TV and you tried to lower the price instead of improve the product?  Garbage.  GET FIRE TV.  1. It comes installed with your Amazon account.  That means set up is just linking your WIFI. TOTALLY COOL AMAZON YOU FRICKIN ROCK!  The app and cool non-IR remote are Awesome.  SIZE MATTERS.  This thing is super small which means you can take it with you everywhere. To your hotel, your friend's house, your mommas anywhere. Portability is key BUT with that you'd think you'd be losing extra features. NOPE. You get them all + more than you want... BUT organized so it's easy to get to without digging.

The stream gets choppy and quality is poor when browsing channels though, this is not the case with my Fire TV. The Fire TV stick is noticeably slower in every aspect than the Fire TV, which I guess is to be expected. I would fork out the extra money and get the full Fire TV, or maybe a Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Cassidy Hallesy"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I rate a 3 star because it has NBA app and MLB App but not NHL app.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very highly recommended", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rhonda"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "missnalie"}]
