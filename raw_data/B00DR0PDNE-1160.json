It worked once \"sort-a\".  I am able to connect to my wifi at home but try to get anything to stream & all you get is error messages & that if you can catch the error messages between the incessant advertisements.  My recommendation if find another solution.The next thing I tried was to cast pictures from my PC to the TV - Chrome cast was made for that - right?  N O T !  Both devices are in the same room.  They connect but no go on the casting.  From what I gather there are other ways to get this done.It would be useful if you got at least a meaningful error messages - Like Your TV is too old or the video format is in compatible - N O T !", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sarah"}]
