It doesn't always play nice with the remote for my BOSE Lifestyle V30 system.  The BOSE tech support contact told me that the BOSE remote uses RF not IR technology and it's getting WiFi interference from the stick.  BOSE is sending me a free remote antenna to rectify the issue.

However, I was very pleasantly surprised when I installed it.  The process was relatively easy, although the instructions could have been a tad more explicit, especially about connecting to the Wi-Fi (it took me a couple of tries before I realized I had to highlight the connection first - my bad).  Anyway, its very easy to use, has worked flawlessly so far and, being a Prime member, I love the video selection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John J.
