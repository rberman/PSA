De Souza \"scriptori\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Please note that I ordered 2 of these at the $19 discounted price. So obviously I can not have complaints, but for even $39, it would be worthwhile.People have to realize that this is a computer - it is obviously not a necessity but is a lot cheaper and better then most other solutions.As of the current updated firmware (12/11/2014), you are able to turn on ADB and install \"unknown\" source installs. I used this to install Kodi and FiredTV launcher. Kodi works just like other computer installs, so you can install your favorite addons and watch sports/TV from around the world (for free). FiredTV launcher is nicer then the normal home screen and makes everything less buggy.As it stands, if you install 3rd party apps, it does not show up under recent history and you have to go into \"all installed apps\" under settings; hence why I installed the other \"launcher.\" I would like to see amazon let people either a) design/sell themes for FireTV or b) let the users customize the home screen in some ways (being able to remove categories). As I do not use 95% of what Amazon wants you to use it for (their TV shows/apps/etc) but I would like to customize it for what I use.. but I can't.I wish this did not need to be plugged into the wall, but that is obviously not Amazon's fault .. as a computer kinda needs power to run. The remote is great to have. I know other people said it \"feels\" flimsy but I think it looks/feels what you would expect from the photo. It at least feels like it will last a few years until it would have issues.. but by then I am sure this will seem like junk by then anyway. Plus you can use other devices like your phone, so even if it breaks, you are not screwed.This DID work with a monitor that I have this is NOT MHL compatible. Great if you have monitors just lying around like me ;) (but monitors are cheap which could give you the ability to have several \"cheap\" TV's that could work at once).If you are trying to decide whether you should get something like this vs a full on HTPC, I would suggest to try this first and see. As this only uses 5w max and if you use a normal computer, that can run 200W+. If that computer is on 24/7 for a year - you could save $137 in electric alone (@ $0.08 p/kWh). If you need more storage (say for your ripped DVD collection), you are better off using a separate computer as a server so you can run Raid5/6 (or better yet ZFS Raidz1/2). Then you can deploy several of these Amazon Sticks around the house and have them connect to the \"server.\" Then you could get redundancy off this option more easily/cheaply - as I doubt many do this on their HTPC's. Plus you do not have a huge clunky/noisy computer right next to your TV as well.All-in-all you are buying a <$40 computer which includes the OS, remote, Wifi, a charger, micro-USB cord, and batteries! Things like this were selling for $200 just a few years ago for less specs. Obviously this will happen anyway due to Moore's Law, but this is truly not a bad item to even just \"play\" with.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Michael Howard"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very good purchase. performs wonderfully.

I don' t know if a new update was pushed to the stick or what but it tries to connect, goes into la la land and stops.I have the same problem with my Fire TV too.Bummer - taking a star back.2015-04-22 editing reviewupgrading to 5 stars - Miracast seems to work perfectly now with recent upgrades pushed down from Amazon. Miracast is cool in that it doesn't require you to establish a local network - it somehow directly establishes a peer to peer wifi connection between my PC and the fire TV stick. Cool.I now also use AirBuddy app on this stick to act as an Apple iPad Airplay display. That works nice too but note that Apple Airplay requires both the Airplay receiver (the fire TV stick in this case) and the Airplay transmitter (my iPad, for example) to be on the same local network so if you use this for iPad display on business travel you must establish a network that does not block comms between ipad and fire stick. The same problem exists with Apple TV - it's an airplay issue. At least with the fire TV stick and remote you now have the ability to easily join a network.The travel features added (ability to log on hotel/public wifi) and ability to bring this for presentations make this a really nice, cheap, handy device for work or play.I'm really glad I got this and what a great deal.2015-01-30 editing review  >>>upgrading to 4 stars because I'm finding it more and more useful and because iPhone app provides voice search - for free!It should probably be 5 stars but I bought it for Miracast and that does not work.<<<Great for streaming of Amazon content - including Prime Music!I really bought this to use as wireless HDMI projection for presentations from a Windows 8 PC and it's claimed Miracast support fails miserably for that purpose.I'm keeping it because it's cheap and I'll try to find another use for it or give it to a family member or something because it's amazon content support is nice but I have a full Fire TV (which started supporting prime music a week ago too and therefore does everything this does just a little better [voice search, faster games, slightly faster menus, etc.]) so I don't really need the stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jtmoderate876"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Would def buy again.

You do need to have the password (or details) for you wifi. Enter that and you're about 95% there.
