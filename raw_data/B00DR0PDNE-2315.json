I plugged it in and after it updated and synced with my Galaxy S4 (about 5 mins) I was watching Netflix videos on my TV.  So far I really like this product.

I have always been a big fan of their products, and this one doesn't disappoint. The Chromecast is super simple to use, and I'm excited to see what the future has in store for this product. Unfortunately for m now, it's still fairly new, so a lot of app developers haven't incorporated ways to use it yet, but I'm sure it will only get better with time. I use it for Netflix and Plex mostly, and occasionally Pandora. I haven't had any glitches or issues with it yet. I recommend it to anyone. You won't find another streaming device this good for this cheap.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Austin\u00a0Michael\u00a0Smith"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "This device is inexpensive, and the idea is good, but it has difficulty connecting, and really serves no purpose.
