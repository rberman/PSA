I just plugged it in to the back of my television and very easy to set up", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Al"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This product worked fine at the start. I have a strong WIFI connection (> 50 Mbps), and the stick was plugged in and powered. However, numerous times, the audio would stop working. Doing a reboot, unplugging the device, many times didn't fix the problem. Other times, the screen would flicker a lot. Unplugging and plugging the stick back in solved that, but it meant every time I wanted to sit down and watch something, I had to do this. I thought this would be a good replacement for cable TV, but it is not. It is not a refined product, but what do you expect for $35 ? Amazon did not spend much time fixing the SW & HW bugs here and you can tell. It is not worth the aggravation. It's better to just watch Netflix or Hulu on a laptop. The idea of putting a fast processor in a stick is nice, but you need to do the quality SW development and HW integration to back it up. This is not something which Amazon did.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "MB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "In Love with this!!! Wow! I can't believe how much it does!

Of course, it works great with Prime, and with Kindle devices to connect to a 'Second Screen'.
