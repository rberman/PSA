I should have done more homework. We have a slow internet connect, so were streaming SD versions of items available on Amazon through my laptop, which worked great. Cannot do this through Fire TV, according to the help chat I just completed. I can adjust the setting to stream at a lower quality to prevent constant buffering,  but my only purchase option will be HD, so I'm paying the higher price still. I do not have a higher speed internet option in my rural area, so this is disappointing. Hoping Amazon will consider updating this product to allow for the SD streaming purchase option.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Catherine G"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Not sure if it is the internet or the fire tv stick but the show hesitates and freezes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bobbie Jo Davis"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very easy to use and gives me a lot of choices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Wilbur Roby"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Prime Music!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.
