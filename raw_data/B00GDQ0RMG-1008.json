[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this Amazon Fire TV Stick. i returned my google chromecast for it. I like that i can use my smartphone to search for things if i want to, but that I have the freedom not to. It's not dependent on my phone to operate. it works really well for my hotel internet and I like that it comes with a remote. I use this daily to watch shows. Going to look into the game controller to see what I can do with this thing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "AL"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!
