Amazon has always been good to me but this is slimy.  To sell a product without Operators Manual and then offer that for 1/3 again the price, after I make the purchase,  is NOT cool.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark B."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "it is amazing technology.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "terry tessier"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great little devise.

This is extremely annoying since it breaks up any continuity the show might have while your wait for a minute or two while the download in going on. We experienced this same problem with Apple TV while living in Mexico for a while. We thought it was because of poor internet connections there, but were very surprised after getting Fire Stick that it has he same problem here where we have a great internet connection. We also have an old Blue Ray disc player that has Netflix on it, and had to switch over to that to finish the show. The Blue Ray player has a built in buffer that allows a complete download upfront. Fire Stick and Apple TV apparently don't have a buffer, so they download in segments thus creating this same problem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dr. Susan Rutherford"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Fernando Bugliani"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the fire TV stick, very convenient if you have netflix account, or you may purchase new  titles at amazon I think the are somewhat pricy, games etc. Now the also have Pandora!!!
