It's a great little device, perfect for travel to hotel rooms (as long as they don't lock down the HDMI ports). It competes quite well with the Roku2 box I bought my Grandma.My only issue is that MLB.TV is pretty spotty with it. Live games are constantly stuttering and buffering. At first I thought it was my internet connection, but my computer could stream just fine. Then I thought it might be the wireless bandwidth, but my laptop was able to stream without a hitch. I borrowed a buddy's blu-ray player and used the app on that over a wireless connection - it also streamed flawlessly.It's kind of sad, since I pre-ordered this specifically to use the MLB.TV app.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Awelowynt"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works and I can enjoy it on my TV!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mona marie"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It worked very lousy...
