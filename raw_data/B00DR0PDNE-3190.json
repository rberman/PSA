Does stream some content to my TV, and does a good job. Not sure what you'd use it for without a Netflix or HuluPlus account (assuming HuluPlus works with it, I haven't tried.) Has to be plugged in to power supply to work, and has a very bright blue LED that compels you to unplug it overnight. I could put tape over the light, but I've left it to remind me to unplug it overnight. Setup was fairly painless.
