I had been using my smart tv to go to netflix and hulu but it didn't have amazon prime on it so I purchased the fire stick.  It's worked great because along with having my amazon prime shows to choose from, I've also noticed that it's way faster than my smart tv!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "johnny"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it, works great, and is very fast, easy to use, gread audio and video quality, direct cast to Youtube and Netflix app (on Android) for $39 is great price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Luis Miguel C S"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Well played, Amazon.  Well.  Played.Disclosure:  I have Google Chromecast, I have a nook, I have a Samsung SIII, I have a Samsung Note 10.1 (which, after owning it for about a year, I wish I would have bought the Microsoft Surface instead) and an iPod Classic.  I\u2019m not a \u201cfan\u201d of any one company; if a product works for me, I buy it and use it.In my personal, and professional, opinion Amazon has the best cloud service in the world\u2026and I\u2019ve used plenty.  Google, Barnes & Noble, Samsung Media Hub, Drop Box, Apple & iTunes, you name it I\u2019ve probably used it.  None of them, I mean, NONE of them compare to the cloud service that Amazon provides.I *almost* didn\u2019t buy the Kindle Fire TV Stick because I thought, \u201chow much different could it be than Chromecast?\u201d buuuuuuut, I did anyways since it was on special for Prime Members when it was first released so I bought it as a Christmas present for \u201cthe house\u201d.  I mean, how different can it be from Chromecast?Holy moley guacamole and Pumpkin Spiced Latte with an extra shot of espresso on the side.Greatest \u2013 Thing \u2013 Ever!You insert the stick into your HDMI insert, much like Chromecast, you can beam and mirror your tablet and phone to your TV, like Chromecast (Chromecast has issues with this mirroring, as it doesn\u2019t work for all hardwares, but I won\u2019t get into that here), but that is where the similarities end.The big difference is that the Fire TV stick comes with a remote control and works with Amazon\u2019s great cloud service seamlessly.  You have a number of apps that you can download to your cloud and use at your discretion:  Pandora, Plex (which we use), Hulu+, Netflix, Crackle, etc .  If you\u2019re a prime member, you have access to all the Prime tv shows and movies, and you have access to everything that Amazon streams.  It seamlessly connects to your Amazon payment account so it\u2019s not cumbersome to buy or rent items (DANGEROUS!).  There\u2019s also a myriad of games.  My boyfriend and I are far from gamers but having something stupid to play to decompress when you don\u2019t want to watch TV is a nice touch as well.  We\u2019ve played bowling, trivia, and ping pong so far.Now if I can get Amazon to send me fresh fruit, veggies, and meat I may never have to leave my house again.Amazon: Influencing Agoraphobics since 1994.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica Nagel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Was very easy to connect and use.
