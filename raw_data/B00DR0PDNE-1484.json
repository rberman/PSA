It comes in a nifty box and is a breeze to set up. You plug the device into the HDMI port and then plug the power cord into the USB port on the rear of the TV. You turn on the TV and then match the number on the TV screen to the matching number on your cell phone/iPad/Android tablet. It then automatically downloads the latest Chromecast version which takes about five minutes. You are then ready for YouTube or Netflix movies. There are other access alternatives (which I am reading about). The tyranny of the cable companies (Comcast) must be avoided and this is one way to do it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jedrury \"jedrury\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's a wonderful", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mahdi Alatawi"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Just learning how to use it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David Galles \"David Galles\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great...free of cable tv", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
