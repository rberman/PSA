I bought he Fire TV for the bedroom where the current tv does not have app capability. It came pre-synced with my Prime account and watch list, and I was easily able to connect to my Netflix account.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alex"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works like a charm!

The most obvious difference was the speed. MUCH faster than my roku. The quality of the unit feels better, heavier, and solid as well. Im watching a movie right now and I am impressed with the video qualityit quickly synced up with my amazon prime membership. Setup took about 2 minutes and that was the time it took for me to enter my WIFI info...This unit is a breeze to setup. I couldnt be happier. This unit is worth $99 but im glad I lucked out and got it for $64.99 :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Vanilla Sky \"DjNellyNel\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazon Fire has been all we hope it would be. Easy install and great selection of programs to chose from.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sandra Chambers"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "All the hype that I read on a supposedly non-amazon connected review was a total disappointment. ! did not see the flash connection to the amazon video movies as stated in the review. The improved clarity of videos was not noticed by me. The amount of apps available not there unless you go looking for these one by one. I have been an avid and loyal Amazon customer for years, having bought at least 4-5 Kindle fire tablets to date. Although, I do like the interaction with the Kindle tablets, the exceptional performance  of the Fire TV was in my opinion greatly  exaggerated. Given that I have used and owned the Apple TV, Roku HD, Sonny module and a Chromecast stick, I have to give the top  performance to Roku HD. I had even disconnected my Roku to be used in one of my secondary tv but after playing with my new Kindle HD TV module. I have to revert my choice back to my Roku. Sorry Amazon, but to me, Amazon Fire TV has much to learn from the Roku module which is more interactive friendly and has nothing to envy in quick performance and clarity.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "pascual lopez"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "The fire stick versus Amazon fire TV is very confusing for me.
