The instructions are very clear, and once you set up the stick is all to go.

I've been a Netflix customer for 12 years. I can stream their videos and I also receive DVDs, since many older and foreign films aren't available to stream. The Fire TV Stick was easy to install and has worked well. I have noticed some streaming glitches on House of Cards programs and the Nina Simone program aired on June 26, possibly due to a large number  of viewers, not Fire TV. Otherwise, a good product at an affordable price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John J. Pruyn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Delivery was right on time.
