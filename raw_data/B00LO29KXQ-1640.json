I've never been so healthy since, and I absolutely love all the features on the stick. I also have AppleTV. I find that the Fire Stick tops AppleTV with all of the available apps.

I bought it to stream MLB.com mostly as well as some other apps. It streams so slowly, pauses every 10 seconds to buffer.
