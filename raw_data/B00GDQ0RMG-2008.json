Takes another 10 minutes to play around and see where the thousands of movies and shows are, but it will be tie well spent and you can start adding shows to your watchlist.  I'm dumping cable for this.Streaming is very good about 99% of the time.  I guess it will depend on your connection. If you have PRIME, this is a must-have, otherwise, ou are missing on the benefits.I wish the PRIME library of popular TV shows was bigger (like CSI or Law & Order included on Prime), but I'm sure that will come with time and the included shows will keep expanding.  Prime's content library is not as big as Netflix's. I would give it  5th star once the library expands.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Luis R.
