I was expecting the performance to be the same, but it really isn't. Secondly, the remote is a little bit different than the one that comes with the Fire TV; this one is cheap, and harder to use as well as less responsive. I would not buy this again, as a matter of fact I will likely sell it and buy a second Fire TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Teredactle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great, especially if u don't have a smart TV .
