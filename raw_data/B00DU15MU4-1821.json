We purchase two of these devices to help us cut the cord to our cable company.  So far it has worked out pretty well.  However, I do have some problems with it.  The \"one click\", buying content can get you in a lot of trouble if you accidentally set on the remote.  So, beware of this and change your account settings before you hook it up.I am also annoyed about the lack of support that I have for my already purchased digital movie copies.  I find it very frustrating that I have held onto my non-redeemed digital copies, in hopes of redeeming them through Amazon, to watch on this device.  Come to find out Amazon does not even support them.  However, iTunes supports every single digital copy I have.  But, Amazon doesn't even have an iTunes app, how frustrating for those people like me that has all of this digital media content that they have purchased over the years.  Also, it is not like Amazon\u2019s content is competitively priced either.  I can purchase a DVD/Blue-Ray/Digital copy combo pack for $30 or less.  So roughly that would be $10 per DVD/Blue-Ray/Digital copy.  ITunes charges $15 for their HD digital copies and they also support the majority of digital copies that are purchased with a DVD.  Why does Amazon have to be so expensive at $20 a pop for an instant video HD digital copy, especially when they don\u2019t support the already purchased digital media you may already have.  I just don\u2019t get it and am completely frustrated by this.  I wouldn\u2019t mind purchasing digital versions of something I already owned if it were more competitively priced, but I just can't see re-building or building a digital library at these prices.Amazon needs to step up their game a little more on this product for this to be perfect in my eyes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
