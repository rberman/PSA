I love the content available on it overall, but there are some definite exceptions. I don't know who has control over what content can be seen on this, but you would think, as I did, that movies that are 20 years old would be available with a Prime membership. I looked for a few of my favorites like Good Fellas, Casino, Scent of a Woman, The Godfather, Heat, Scarface, etc. and all are available, FOR RENT!!!! Who's in control of the content available on this device? Is it that since the more popular titles can still earn revenue from rentals, those in control won't let them be streamed?It would also be nice to be able to see some national news on this in real time. The CBS News app is not sufficient in this area. I am trying desperately trying to kick cable to the curb, but I am not sure this is the device that will help me do it. I also question the Prime membership thing. I can partner this up with Netflix, get the same content (actually more) and pay $9 more a year overall for the same thing. I'm having trouble distinguishing what the benefit is in having Prime for this device, (without regard to the shipping benefits for the things I buy from Amazon).All of that being said, I do like the Fire TV, it works really well and streams like crazy. My computer doesn't stream video as well as it does. Everything I watch is \"instant on\" with no hiccups or buffering; I couldn't be more impressed. The voice search works great, and the device overall leaves a small footprint in my space. This a great value for the price, and I will be keeping it, but will continue to try to get an answer to the questions I raised above.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "8/8", "author": "Reid Patterson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "May be one of my best purchases!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Valerie P."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "good product only minor differences and huge program changes between this and android platform devices.Differences:1.Every app purchase is made through amazon and won't be added to your android library in Play Store.2.If use android media player you will have to download amazon Appstore to cross reference files and saved content with multiple devices there is no cross platform.3.This won't give you access to those apps saved that you used prior to amazon fire purchase and only apps that use a certified log in and premium content mite have accessibility to your older content(after you log in to such an account).Huge Programming Changes:1.You will notice from first power on this is all amazon and nothing but amazon in advertisements to your content.2.The content available and the content on the fire os menu differ slightly. Only on amazon full web site do you see all of their ready to install apps(unless you know exactly what the apps name is it won't always show up in search on fire).3.I have heard all the APK's you will need can be side loaded with debugging support for developers and akin.Not very many media players have brought all these features to a stand alone media player making it very versatile.I have 2 of these fire tv boxes now and I haven't experienced a single problem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "YO#2isGO"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "netflix is better.  takes to long to find free movies", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "William Brown"}]
