Not the case at all. It wasn't until I Google searched help to figure out how to troubleshoot casting that I saw a multitude of other customers who were duped as well, including those who work in associated tech fields. No Bueno, Amazon. In addition to that disappointment, the power cord is REALLY short and is about 6\" too short to reach my surge protector. Although the manual urges you to use the included power cord and adapter, the stic thankfully runs just fine off the power it gets from the USB port on my tv. The likes: a simple low profile remote, ability to use the FireTV app (in case remote is lost or batteries dead), fast surfing and response time of commands, no buffering issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Amanda"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it. It is all that Amazon said it would be. It was shipped very quickly and arrived without hassle. To set it up you just plug it into any HDMI port and answer questions via the remote. It couldn't be easier. You do need wi-fi though and an Amazon account. There is TONS of programming on Amazon Prime and you can receive Net Flix or many other content. The games are basic but that is OK. The remote is basic too but there are replacements that are more comprehensive.Good solid product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Casch \"Chris\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just what I needed", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this for a friend and so far, she absolutely loves it.
