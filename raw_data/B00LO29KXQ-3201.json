[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "After a frustrating attempt with ROKU stick, and a disappointing try with Chromestick, the Firestick is a pleasant surprise - it works! Aside from some glitches trying to play YouTube videos, the stick performs great so far. Recommend purchasing Amazon Prime - lots of free movies and TV series.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Henk DeYoung \"cookie\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "PIECE OF JUNK. Honestly, it worked fine for me for about a month and then I began to have issues with wifi connectivity. I tried every tip on their site to troubleshoot and nothing worked. At this point, I was annoyed but it was Amazon so I figured the return/replace process would be easy.How wrong was I? These Fire items must be special, because they have an entire fleet of worthless customer service personnel that will constantly pass the buck to the next department. And NONE of them will be helpful.I still have the stupid stick and am going to trash it and invest my money in  Roku or something. Very disappointed in Amazon tech and, more surprisingly, their \"amazing\" customer service that failed miserably to help me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!
