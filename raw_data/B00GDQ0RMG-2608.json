I have never had to worry with a scene lagging with my smart tv but with this I did.  Not satisfied.

It streams Prime video finr but other services like Netflix and Hulu (especially Hulu) have consistent issues with video freezing. If I didn't have a Chromecast I'd be really frustrated but I bought this primarily to get prime video to my television and it does that well enough. So for twenty bucks it's okay.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ken"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Froze on Netflix and never watched a full show.
