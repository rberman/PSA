[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Fire stick was very easy to work with.You just install it in the HDMI port. It allowed us to get rid of Direct TV which we did not have very good service with. I like you can pick many TV shows to watch and movies. Using it in conjunction with Amazon Prime is even better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karen Nelson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We use it for mainly Netflix. We love it!

I have a smart tv with no gaming system.  This little usb drive fits very well in the back of the tv.  This allows me to watch Netlix, Amazon, Showtime and HBO all with 1 remote and 1 system!  I do find using the stick to access HBO or Showtime is slower then when accessing those apps directly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angie Morris"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Enjoying my Fire Stick!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lynnms"}]
