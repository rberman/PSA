After 3 hours of plugging away, I have yet to experience a strike (almost as bad as my fishing luck but how far is this silly \"casting\" metaphor for the sake of alliteration worth taking)? I was more than a little impressed by my $60 ROKU box (a gadget that's so effective I gave two to my grandkids and an extra to my wife, who occasionally uses it at her desk).Next up was the Apple T'V box, which admittedly has seen far less use.  Part of the problem is the tiny aluminum remote control, which has proven virtually impossible to keep track of for more than 3-4 days at a time (a replacement is $20--or you can download the free (but unsatisfying) one from the App Store).  Equally problematic with Apple TV is that I really don't get any extra pleasure from \"streaming\" videos, photographs, and audio files from my computer to my 40\" Sony--esp. when no one else appreciates the novelty.  And unlike ROKU, Apple TV doesn't offer videos from Amazon, many of which come with no extra charge to Amazon Prime members.  True, iTunes has become the store with everything for every body, but frankly I found it more useful as a \"dedicated\" music service.  Of late iTunes has become cluttered in appearance and sluggish (even stubborn) in operation due to its many offerings (tunes, apps, books, magazines, movies and now extending to major computer programs and operating systems along with its iCloud and social services.  I had until recently always thought of Apple as a cutting-edge innovator, trend-setter, and \"leader\"--sort of the \"Miles Davis of consumer electronics.\" It seems almost sad these days to see this former giant-slayer looking to sites like Facebook and even Pandora for guidance.  Beginning perhaps with \"Genius\" and continuing, most recently, with the iTunes \"radio station\" Apple has stooped to the \"gonzo\" revenue-producing tactics used by dozens of mediocre companies to hijack personal information from anyone who surfs the internet or uses a computer--the better to serve \"individual\" choices (i.e. by selling more media products that match up the user's \"profile\"--i.e. the personal \"tastes\" of the consumer).I should have known, especially since Apple TV saw so little use, that the investment in Chromecast would be problematic. After two hours I managed to set up, through my wi-fi, my very own \"casting\" channel (using an iPod Touch) and am now staring at at the words, in large font on a 40\" Sony screen, \"ready to cast.\"  Looking at my iPod screen, I see two options--YouTube and Netflix--but clicking on either produces no change to my television picture.  I've even pulled out my 2011 Mac Air, which can offer me Chrome as an alternative to Safari (along with dozens of questions asking me for a simple check in response for Google's request for personal material on my computer--information that I'm loathe to disclose, since all I stand to receive in return is the ability to cast/throw/mirror/extract/download a few Youtube or Netflix images viewable on my TV.  And now I see notes from Google warning of a \"small caveat\" that Chromecast is optimized for the 2012 or newer Mac Air (when \"Chromecasting\" with a 2011 Mac Air, I was \"skunked).In conclusion, this is a potentially nifty little gadget (not much bigger than a thumb drive) for the right person with the right browser and the right equipment. But besides problems with getting Chromecast to cast a youtube video (I finally got it to perform as advertised with an iPod Touch 5g), I was unprepared for the extra clutter of a USB powered cable (which, unlike my Roku or Apple TV, isn't long enough to reach from the closest AC outlet to the required HDMI port. (You could spend $15 for an AC outlet that adheres to the back of a TV set (InstaOutlet Google Chromecast Streaming Media Installation kit.  But now you're within $10 of an infinitely more useful ROKU box).  I've read a couple of reviewers who rationalize that the ChromeCast is a great little \"back-up\" for use on the road. I already have 2-3 back-ups, and my road warrior days are behind me. The way I see it, one less Chromecast will save me enough to pay for almost 4 days of my cable package.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Caponsacchi"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I actually borrowed this from my folks and ended up buying them a new one after keeping theirs. If you are looking to stream netflix or Youtube from your Ipad to the tv over wifi this is a great little device. I decided not to get cable in my new place and have an hdmi cable hooked up to a computer that I stream most everything from.The freedom of being able to do this from my Ipad using netflix or YouTube is great. I only wish there were more options. I have the old generation Ipad so I think with the new ones you can stream Chrome tabs as well which might end all my issues, but even from the computer there seems to be more delay streaming chrome tabs then there is streaming from the Ipad apps. This would get 7 stars from me if there was just a little more functionality, though i have heard there will likely be more apps jumping on board soon.I threw a house warming and someone mentioned some random YouTube video, the ability to grab my ipad and show the video on the big screen was a HUGE hit and for $35 bucks I think its really hard to go wrong here.You should buy this.
