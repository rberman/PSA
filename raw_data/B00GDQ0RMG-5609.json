I really wanted to use it for Amazon Prime which I cannot get on my Apple TV.  I had very high hopes... The packaging is fantastic...  The remote and the device is clean and even the power \"brick\" is really well thought out...  They even loaded in my prime data which was a very nice touch!!  ... but when it comes to using it... it falls well short of any reasonable expectation.  I'm not being picky... it's really bad.  I hope the rest of the \"fire\" line is better than this device.Issues:The fire stick suffers from huge delays.  I'm not talking about 1-2 seconds...  Press the button to scroll down 3 movies and it just sits there... then all of a sudden it will start hopping all over the place.  Cold rebooted and started pushing the button's slower...  ALLOT slower and it still got stuck.  I have the A/C plugged in...  It's either a really slow processor or lousy firmware/software.  My guess is that it's the software since any basic processor can scroll etc...  The system was not doing anything else at the time..I finally got it to play a video...  Video on Amazon prime is very blurry when compared to netflix or youtube or anything else that's \"HD\" on the Apple TV.  Checked the internet connection and it was \"very good\".  Router is 20' from the device with a clear line of sight.  seriously blurry like netflix was 10 years ago...  I played \"catching fire\" *(Ironic...)  on a 2 year old Apple TV and the Fire and the difference was dramatic.The Parental controls are horrible.  I just don't want anyone buying movies without a password.  You can't just enable that.  It becomes a huge hassle to use the device if you turn on parental controls...Update this AM:Restarted the fire TV and it can't find any internet connection.  It's stuck there not able to find any connection even though every other device is connected and working..  Apple TV, Chromebook, Phone, PS3.Don't buy this product... at least not yet.  It has allot of hope but this generation is a bust.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ben"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Bought two and both worked wonderful for a week then after that it told me it wasn't connected to the Internet and to try again and wouldn't let me watch anything.
