If you expect more from the Fire TV Stick, I would suggest the upgrade to the Fire Box. I did not expect it to perform like the box. For the price it is better than being without it to have to put in a DVD. It was purchased because of the performance of the box and because of the 19.00 cost. Now that is a special just knowing what I paid for the box. For the cost I was not expecting the same performance. The Junior version of the box. It can also be like what I expect from a adult I am not going to expect from the child. If you're able to understand it from that point of view. I believe that I can use my voice remote from the box with the stick. If not I will make a separate purchase. I believe it is worth it. I am going to purchase another stick for my household and maybe another box. If I am enjoying my tv I would like my family to be enjoying theirs. But it is also good to have prime under your belt. It is a combo. We have to pay for what we want to enjoy in our own homes.Take it from me, enjoy for it could have and it can be worst with another product. I see a lot of comparison to others and you're not satisfied with them. Today we make a purchase and then something comes out better and we then upgrade and pass the other one on to someone whom wanted one but could not make that purchase.
