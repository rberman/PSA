Best $20 I could possibly have spent for our viewing pleasure. Crisp, clear, very good quality streaming. No skips, no issues. Automatically starts TV, or changes to the appropriate input. Has a good menu system that's easy to navigate. Probably the only suggestion for navigation is that I'd like the ability to make subfolders in areas such as Watchlist. We've got over 100 videos on our Watchlist, and it's a nuisance to navigate to the end of the list.Oh, and on top of everything else, it has a great screen saver app with >100 gorgeous full HD images. I only wish there were subtitles on them to tell me the locations being shown.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charlie Russel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this little thing", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jason wolfe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Stick is absolutely amazing I would recommend this product to everyone.
