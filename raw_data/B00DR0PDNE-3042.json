[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I am happy with this item. I can now watch Netflix listen to pandora through my tv. My only disappointment is due to the fact that I have a Cruz tablet and it is not Google certfied so I am unable to download the Chromecast app and fully utilize the functions of this device. This might be useful info for people who want to take advantage of it's full functionality. When I  update my tablet I hope this will allow me to do much more in the future.

After a two days of watchin Netflix content on the big screen via Wi-Fi ,instead through wire from a mode,it stop downlouding .

It is great for your bedroom or even living room, It works great and it stays cool. It actually does what is advertised, and smoothly. The setup is very fast and easy. Only wish that I could have set it up from my smart phone instead of having to get it set up on my laptop. I have synced it with my phone, tablet, and laptop and works great with each one and does what is advertised! It is fairly cheap, and alot cheaper than a new smart tv, it does the same tasks and its fast!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "King"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have 2 Roku boxes and love using the Chromecast over both of them.
