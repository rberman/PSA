[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have had nothing but problems since installing the Fire Stick!  It constantly freezes up or locks up and the only recourse is to reset the router.  I have a Roku on another TV and a Chromecast on my daughter's TV and both of these perform flawlessly.  I am really frustrated with this item as it's almost impossible to watch a complete show or movie without it locking up and having to reset the router in order to finish my show.  I would have returned it, but I kept thinking that it was just a glitch and that it would get better as it broke in.  If it continues, I will be looking at replacing it with another Roku that I know will work properly!  Totally regret this purchase.  I had high expectations only to be disillusioned by Amazon's colorful description.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "D.

Great quality picture and the popping has disappeared from my HDMI connection.

It works, but I don't use it near as frequently as my Chromecast.  I bought it because Amazon had it on pre-order special for $15.

After a few weeks of use (we have had a box for about a month), the stick has some downfalls. The remote absolutely SUCKS compared to the more expensive option. The remote feels absolute cheap compared to the more expensive option. The remote sometimes understands what you want, and sometimes not. It's fun - setting the remote down while you're in an App only to find that it backs up 20 minutes in your application then backs up to the main menu of the Amazon FireStick Application Menu - just from setting it down (multiple times here folks).Other times, it will not respond right way then ends up doing all your commands at once. This means you click \"fast forward\" three times over 5-8 seconds (you know - you click, then wait, then click again, etc) and you end up fast forwarding much more than you originally thought. The remote seems to respond when it wants, batteries being full or not.The FireTV (expensive version) remote feels MUCH better and doesn't seem to have these odd reactions to when you set the remote down in an odd way. That remote also fits better in your hand and seems to have better range than the cheaper version.I really do own both, and I even have the gaming remote. I still prefer the FireBox (ie: upgraded/expensive version) over the \"stick\"  option. The stick will probably be put into my guest room or such, since it's so cheap feeling.Edit: Some spelling fixed. I've swapped my primary TV and Master TV so that the FireTV (expensive option) is in the primary room we watch TV in. Things are much better. The FireStick is still used, but not nearly as much, and my frustration has gone down as such.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JR"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I prefer the regular Fire TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Haven't to any great extent but when I do, it's easy review movies available", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John E.
