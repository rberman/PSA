Prime members should have eccess to more free stuff.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JTM"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This device is nothing short of amazing.  For the owner of an older television that was (and still is) otherwise high-end but that does not offer access to apps like Amazon Prime and Netflix this is a game-changer.  It is easy to use and install, streams video effortlessly and without the pixelization and degradation of image quality that I have experienced with other devices.  Frankly, for the price there is nothing that even comes close to this level of functionality.  Buy one today - I'd wager you won't regret that decision.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "E5150"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Plug and go works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark Palmer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is good!One time, it was playing Pandora and the same time I was watching Netflix.
