[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "We received this as a gift, as my husband is a movie lover. We're disappointed at the movie selection, especially since I'm a prime member. Most of the Prime movies are at least ten years old and mediocre at best. Would like to see more variety for adults. Lots of kid stuff though... I would rather rent a movie from RedBox than rent one from the FireStick for $4.99+. The apps you can download, like Hulu Plus, are slow and freeze in the middle of movies. We still use it but wouldn't recommend to others.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sdustin"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Little bit disappointed free channel and apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charlie  Yoo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This makes streaming movies and other content very easy.

That is probably the biggest flaw.  I prefer my Roku box for ease of use.  This is definitely an Amazon product. While it runs the Prime stuff great,  it lacks features to support other \"channels\" like Hulu Plus, Netflix or PBS.  You can use those channels, but you can't do an overall search for a show like on the Roku, where it tells you which channel offers what you are looking for.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "HopeSprouts"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Super simple, amazing technology for the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "wanderlust"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my Fire Stick!!  My wife and I each have a Kindle Fire HD, and I always wished that we could watch the content that we get on the Kindles on our 56\" flat screen TV.  A friend told me to get a smart TV.
