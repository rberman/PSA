[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the Amazon Fire Stick.  It is great to watch movies and T.V. shows on my flat-screen T.V.  I also enjoy the fact that Amazon Prime choices are free. And, the fact that HULU and Netflix are included is a great plus.  I enjoyed watching on my computer and tablet, but, watching on the \"big screen\" is simply wonderful.I am in my s 60's and was able to connect the stick within 15 minutes--simple instructions and wonderful service!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Doris G.
