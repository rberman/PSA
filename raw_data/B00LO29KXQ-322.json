The UI stutters a lot, as does content.  I notice that it seems to occur after watching for a while, and the unit itself gets quite warm.  This may be a defective unit, or common to the design itself.  In all fairness, my 2 Fire TV devices are hard-wired, while this unit is wireless.  I do have other wireless devices that do not have any issues with streaming.If you have an available Ethernet connection and can spend the extra $, spring for the full version.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brent L.
