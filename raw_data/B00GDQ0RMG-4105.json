However the Fire TV Stick doesn't currently support the ability to use shared-private networks that require a username& password to log in so I cannot connect to my school's secure network. Normally this would be no problem since we have a public network as well, but because I don't have the option to open an internet browser  either, I can't even register this device for the public network either, leaving me with a TV, a Fire Stick, and no ability to watch anything on them. My school's IT department said that Amazon is currently working on an update to fix this issue, so I hope it happens soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brianne"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excedded my  expectations very easy to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul Henderson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy with my new Amazon Fire Stick.
