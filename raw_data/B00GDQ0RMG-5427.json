I will come back and update this should things change. The four stars are because initial setup was a bit of a pain. I easily connected it to my wi-fi network. As soon as I did that the stick required me to download updates. I tried and tried to get the updates to download. It would get maybe 10% of the way through downloading updates and then it would fail and tell me I had to try again. I would try again and get the same result. Making it extra annoying is that I had to unplug the power source each time.After trying to download updates five times I got the idea that perhaps the throughput on my network wasn't sufficient since it was being used by my PC, laptop, phone, and my son's Kindle. So I reset the stick and connected it to the 5G network in my house (I have a dual-band router). As soon as I did that it, success!  The updates downloaded in 3-4 minutes and then the install went easy. As soon as all that was done it was up and running. I like it so far.. Netflix comes through great, Amazon streaming works great, hoping HBO streaming is featured once that comes live.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Todd Mandel"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I had high hopes for this device.  It stated that the performance is above other similar devices, but I didn't see it.  I use an old Wii device to watch NetFlix and the connectivity (slightly further away from my router than the fire stick's placement) is consistent...no buffering.  I was constantly bombarded with buffering using the fire stick.  Even the fire stick said the connectivity was \"very good\", it's performance said otherwise.  Maybe some trick or some upgrade will fix this, but out of the box this Christmas...very disappointed.Also, just something to point out when setting up the original connectivity to my router.  I had my router on channel 6, but it wouldn't connect and kept kicking me back to the password screen for the wireless configuration.  After about 5 or 6 tries, I went and changed my router's channel to \"auto\" and the fire stick picked up the router.  Odd, but it worked.UPDATE:  I rearranged a room and now have line of sight almost to the router (even though I had \"very good\" connectivity before).  Working fine now.  No other device I own needs to be this close to the router, but that's what it took to work.  If the connectivity was better I'd give the stick a 5 star rating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "asiasoon"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "At the time of writing, the FireTV Stick will not connect to Wi-Fi networks that have a passphrase containing a backslash (and possibly other special characters).
