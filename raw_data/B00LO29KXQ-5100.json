This seems to stream movies much faster and clearer than our DVD player and our Roku.

The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is I had a hell of a time connecting to the device with the amazon app, The device has to be active, but not currently streaming. And then half the time it still doesn't show up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "andoerin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far I just love the fire stick. For the price it was worht it. I was abale to access my fire tv account perfectly. The remote is just the same , but with out the speak option. No matter to me.

It's fast, simple, and has a great remote. If you've ever used a streaming bluray player or smart tv, most of the time the navigation is awful. This thing even works nicer than my computer.I only have one minor gripe with the remote design: it's a slick little unit, but I think the \"home\" button is too close to the \"pause\" button. I hit it accidentally all the time. I wish they'd change that.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "R \"sir_rob79\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works well.

Roku allows Amazon as just one more content provider, but lacks the control and management, and the ease of use that comes from Amazon, for Amazon Instant Video. As just one example, you cannot remove recently viewed movies from the screen of Roku. This and many more management tools are automatically part of the Fire TV Stick user experience. Small, works perfectly, excellent quality images and Instant Prime - centric. Returned Roku and never been happier with a replacement product that better meets my needs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "D. J.

I had difficultly putting the batteries in the remote, but after that it was a breeze to setup and use. Will buy an additional unit for my lake cottage.
