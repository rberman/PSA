We can watch almost everything we want using these two services.  I would like to see some Disney shows and movies available on Amazon Prime though.  The stick works nicely, though it does have a hiccup every now and then.  Resetting the stick does help when it can't seem to connect to the internet.  It does help to have the wireless router closer to the stick.  We ended up moving the router into another room in the house so that it would be closer to both sticks that we use in different rooms of the house.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cynthia Ripoll \"sweetheartclb\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Zury"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I'm hoping someone from amazon can respond to me.  I have been trying to figure out how to get help with my fire stick.  I really like it and when it runs good it is awesome.  However, we do have problems almost half the time when trying to watch on it.  It just won't play or skips half the time.  It usually says it doesn't have internet connection, however when we look at the signal strength it is on full strength.  Please help- what do we do?  Otherwise we might have to return it.  Also, when the fire stick doesn't work, we can watch without problems through my laptop or kindle fire so I know it is specifically the fire stick.
