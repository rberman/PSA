[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really am enjoying the experience with my new Amazon fire TV stick. I ordered it to be able to watch Netflix. But I had no ideal of everything else available with it has well. Ordering was easy and fast delivery. I live in a low income and poverty part of the city, so when ordering anything I track my orders. Knowing when exactly I was going to receive my order was greatly appreciated. I was able to make sure someone would be available for delivery which gave me a ease of mind.
