One of the main reasons I purchased this was the \"coming soon feature - \u2014take Fire TV Stick with you to use with HDTVs in hotels, college dorms, or anywhere with captive portal Internet access that requires entering a password or a log-in.\"  I ordered this way back in November or 2014.  When I called customer service earlier this month they had no idea what I was talking about.  When the rep put me on hold and asked around no one else knew about this feature or when it would be released.  I will change my rating when this feature is available or at least a release date.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "JeremyPDX"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am kicking myself that I didn't order more back in November!  This is by far the easiest streaming device on the market!  We have had google tv since the beginning and what a fiasco!  When it works it causes the cable to not work, this hooks up  and boom no problems!  We love it!  My husband hates TV, but I have him watching back episodes of the Blacklist and House of Cards!  Prime users need this!  It's awesome!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Deborah A.

I wish I'd had my husband buy one with his prime account also when they were on predate. I only have one small gripe (or maybe just a heads-up): the stick needs to connect not only to the HDMI port on the tv, but also to a power cable, which wasn't long enough to run though the wall with the rest of our cables. I ended up getting an adapter to plug the stick into an HDMI cable and it sits in the tv shelf with the other consoles, rather than being plugged directly into the back of the tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
