While it is advertised as a device to stream a fair amount of \"free content\" in addition to pay as you go, the \"free channels\" have commercials that last 30 -180 seconds after a few minutes of listening or viewing.  Very annoying. Roku should tell you this in advance so you know what you are getting before you buy the device.  The Roku device, as well, is impressively slow even with a good internet connection and a modern high def television.  Finally, many of the \"channels\" require registration involving user ID information and selection of passwords, as if there is not enough of this to track already.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jazzpop"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Love Roku miss Aero.
