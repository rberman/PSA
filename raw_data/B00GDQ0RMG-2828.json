Very disappointed. the general UI needs more polishing, its just too lazy with animations. amazon pushes amazon's video content over competitor apps, so instead of seeing all of the available ways to watch a movie via prime, netflix, hulu, it doesn't do that well enough for me to recommend this device. Youtube app is slow. All apps other than hulu, netflix, prime apps are all half-assed converted android apps that may or may not work correctly. I am very disappointed in this device. especially the slingplayer app, the main reason I got this device, the sling player app is just so annoying. It gets the job done, and thats about the only pro, too many cons to list: slow ui, no built in channel guide, extreme lag pressing/sending any button commands, Can never do full HD, \"better\" quality skips, its only watchable at \"good\" quality. My slingbox is on a 55Mbps download and 27Mbps upload and plugged directly into the modem (for testing purposes)! and the remote spot is 30Mbps download, so there is no reason to not be getting full HD, let alone skips. I am extremely disappointed with my slingplayer app and the firetv stick in general. BUT it is still better overall than the slingplayer / chromecast!I would not recommend this device. But if you are looking for a simple plug and play slingplayer app, even though it sucks, than this is probably the best option right now since it sucks less than the chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "TheDude"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is great!

Main use is for MLB-TV. Very disappointing!!!! Great for NFlix,  You say its so powerful??It Stalls constantly.It says its my connection, yet the settings says my Linksys conn. is  \"very good\" So I bought a Roku Stick-wks FANTASTIC! Can watch all the games.Everything also comes in Great on the MLB-TV app on my Panasonic Plasma. SO obviously U should put in LARGE printing on the boxes \"NOT FOR USE WITH MLB TV\"As a matter of fact ur list of uses does not include MLB-TV, wish I had known that. Thank You  P.
