[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received the Amazon Fire stick as a Christmas gift. It was easy to install, just plug it into the tv, and easy to set up the program viewing. I was pleasantly surprised to see it offered Amazon Prime free for 30 days. I have found the remote very easy to use, allowing you to navigate through the TV screen to view the many choices in movies, TV programs and music that are offered.  In all, the Amazon Fire stick is a five star product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "paula giroux"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this thing!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Athena Zieser"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It's kind of dull.
