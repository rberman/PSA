Netflixs, Youtube, Xfinity to go, hulu comes through crystal clear.  I can also add channels through my tablet and watch on them tv.  I love this.  If I need to use the computer the grandchildren can still enjoy their favorite shows.  Most tablets work great but I have a Samsung Tab taht works a remote.

I'm so used to devices needing to be fiddled with or adjusted and software that needs to have a work around to get it going.  I plugged this thing in, my phone saw it, I typed in my wireless password and was watching Netflix in 10 minutes.  There has been 1 software update that took a few minutes to download, but this has been the easiest, most seamless device I've installed in a long time.  Google does it right.I would like to see the app available in more places.  I have a rooted android phone that is my entertainment interface and I had to install google play app to get the chromecast app.  Not a big deal, but if I could've just downloaded the apk from a website it would've been so much more convenient.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This little device adds a whole new dimension to home entertainment and television viewing.

It's not until I cast a tab that I have issues. There is a delay in audio, sometime the video is the issue, depending on the speed of the scene that is playing. I am not too impressed with the casting, I was hoping it would play a lot smoother, but it definitely needs more work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard Mora"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Not user friendly - having many issues with installing it on the TV and linking it to our network.
