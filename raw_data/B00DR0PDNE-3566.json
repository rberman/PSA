Setup takes a just a couple minutes, and will require a computer connected to your WIRELESS network.  For instance, I didn't have my laptop at home when I initially received my Chromecast, and since my desktop only had a hard-wired connection, I was not able to use it to setup and configure my Chromecast.Other than that little hiccup, everything has been performing well above my expectations. I am shocked at how responsive the device is, and things are only getting better with the feature set of the device, as more and more app move to support Chromecast.

I, personally, believe the Chromecast output is cleaner and it is usually easier to load up with my phone.
