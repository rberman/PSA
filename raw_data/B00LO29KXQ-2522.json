[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "After an extensive comparison with other similar devices (Chromecast, Roku) this was the safest bet. And I'm pretty sure I can say it does the job quite well. Yes they put Prime content upfront I mean, it's their product you know? But you can leave with that.The actual device is actually small (length of a credit card). It could use a longer power cord.The interface could use a little help, it's simple but not as intuitive as I expected; think about it as a tablet/smarthphone; in order to watch content other than Amazon's you'll need to download the individual apps from the corresponding service.I think it's the best of the bunch!...stick-wise talking, I still like my second gen Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rod Urbina"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy set up, works wonderfully!
