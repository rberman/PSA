I was pleased with the ease of instillation and the amazing picture quality using the Fire TV Stick, with navigation and access so simple.  I would, and have recommended this to anyone interested in a product to stream movies, music, and shows.  Now that I can easily watch Prime titles I will take full advantage of a membership that was previously utilized for shipping.

Can't stream from DishAnywhere or Starz (Dish Network not supported on many apps-- Come on DISH!)... Requires that you plug it into a power outlet (Works for me b/c of setup, but I can see this being a negative if you don't have a power outlet hidden behind TV)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Austin Allen"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "We bought two one of the remotes doesn't work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrew Corral"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am loving the fire stick.

I gave it only three stars because I am comparing to chrome and Roku, and in my opinion firestick comes in a close third.  Two reasons, the main one being that the power plug in is on the side, what were the designers thinking? When you plug this in to an HDMI jack that has an adjacent jack next to it, it effectively takes up two jacks because the cord covers the adjacent jack and renders it useless.  Chrome has the plug on the end of the stick and this make way more sense.Second reason is the stick goes to sleep and its hard to wake it up.  Sometimes you have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to wake up, that is a pain.Also the remote is really really small and easy to loose, with chrome there is no remote and you usually know where your phone is to activate it.My recommendation if price is not an issue, go with the Roku-Chrome combo and leave Amazon to delivering packages.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Davidt100"}]
