For that function alone, totally worth it.On the other hand, its ability to cast other videos playing in the chrome browser is not fully developed, which is disappointing, because that would really expand the possible uses for the product. Additionally, upon moving and changing my wifi setup, I had a lot of trouble getting the chromecast to accept the change of networks. Eventually it did work out and the chromecast has picked up the new wifi consistently after the few first times I tried to use it in the new location, but it was a bit of a hassle to get it switched.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "uneanthropologiste"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ric"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "EXCELLENT", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "REHAN SHARIFF"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works great .
