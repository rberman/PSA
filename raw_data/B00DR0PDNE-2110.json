I found that once you start the movie it is best to just let it play. Even the picture slide shows are a pain in the neck to see what you want to see", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "chris shanahan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Chromecast is streaming to the tv done right.  You search for and control your media on your tablet or smartphone.  Which is the best interface to use.  It's better than streaming boxing like apple tv and fire tv where you have to use a remote.  It also works with any android, iphone or ipad.  No other streaming device does that.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J. Limandri"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Simply put... Its not working! I've done every troubleshooting possible solutions, but I can't seem to get my working. Im frustrated as I know setting up chrome cast streaming should be so simply.

My sister loves hers, but my stepdad's doesn't work. We tried two units and they both kept losing the signal on 720p and 1080p trying to stream the desktop. They were just photos we were trying to stream. So, they seem kind of \"hit and miss.\" Good thing they're cheap or I'd be ticked off.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "OmegaMan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great. Does what it says it'll do, that's always nice. Has only disconnected on us a few times. Only drawback is that it only seems to do youtube and netflix. While that's usually all you need every once and a while it'd be nice to stream something else. It might be possible with apps or something i'm not sure. But all in all, yeah it's a great gadget.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Blorch"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This is an OK product.
