[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This device transformed my bedroom TV into an entertainment center. I didn't realize the selection Amazon Prime Instant Video had until I got it. I have the student discount so I only have to pay ~$50 and it's well worth it. I can watch shows on multiple devices and thanks to this, I get to watch my favorite shows/movies as I fall asleep. I rarely have buffer issues.If you want to play game apps I recommend the FireTV and not the stick. If you only plan on streaming videos, this is an amazing device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Doctor Feel Good"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "One of the best things I ever purchased from amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Vishwanath"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I like the stick, but Amazon's email to me asking to rate it said \"how did this item meet your expectations?\" and it didn't.  I am going to return it.  Here's why:  I use a Yamaha YSP-1000 sound projector on my 65\" TV and there's a problem:  the stick only used the TV's speakers and doesn't take over the Yamaha sound projector like my DVD player and Cable Box do.  So watching movies through The Fire TV stick has pretty crappy sound.  I talked to the service people at Amazon and there's no fix.  They apologized.  About the only thing I can do is by the Fire BOX for $99 instead and get an optical cable and plug the box into the sound projector, and they didn't promise that would work either.  The box has provisions for an optical cable and so does the Yamaha YSP-1000.  So that's my next step.  For the Amazon engineers that might read this: it's a programming step in the stick!  An easy fix if you'll do it.  My other devices look for add ons and tap into them, yours doesn't!  Disappointed that my three year old DVD player can do this correctly and your brand new stick cannot.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gregg"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Roku's laid out so much better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Miss Pita"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "My screen goes dark for many seconds at s time whenever I switch to the HDMI input with the fire stick in it.

I need to clear the cache every day for HULU otherwise it seems to slow slow down or lockup. My understanding is it has to do with the way HULU streams their content.

I don't have bad eyes either.I was hoping to do away with cable TV, but it doesn't appear that that is going to happen.  Sure I can get broadcast channels with an antenna and old movies through Amazon.  But what about current movies?
