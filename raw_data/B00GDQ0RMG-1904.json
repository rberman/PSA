The apps crash often (hbo go is especially bad), the OS is rather slow and feels like a cluttered mess that is constantly trying to get you to buy things and download other apps. If you ever have to do a factory reset you will be forced to sit through the intro video again as it isn't skip-able. I've already had to call the tech support once and even they admitted that you need to unplug it regularly to let it reset itself, and then plug it back in a few minutes later. I wouldn't recommend even at this low of a price, go with a roku player instead.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Grant"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!
