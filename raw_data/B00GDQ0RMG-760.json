And, as I have read on other negative posts, when you call Support, you are told that you have to be within 10 feet of your router.  So, I asked the agent, should I move my kitchen to my home office or, my home office to my kitchen.  Nowhere on the site does it state you need to be within 10 feet.  I have been on the phone with their techs for almost an hour, done herculean back flips and this device is just terrible.  And yes, my Apple TV, an inch away works seamlessly.  So much for the benefit of Amazon Prime and streaming videos. Unless you live in a studio, and stream on top of your router, stay away.  I just wish there was a rating of zero stars.
