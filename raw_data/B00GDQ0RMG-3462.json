[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have two home theater systems, one with an HDMI receiver and an older one with a non-HDMI receiver.  I ordered the Amazon Fire TV to be connected to my non-HDMI receiver.  The connection is identical to my Apple TV.  Since I also ordered a Fire TV Stick at the same time, I initially connected both to my HDMI receiver for a side-by-side test.  Both worked well; however, both my wife and I agreed that the picture quality on the TV was slightly better with the Fire TV Stick.Other reviews stated that the Fire TV Stick will not work well when connected directly to the HDMI receiver instead of the TV, but I did not find this to be accurate.  To test the surround sound capability, I downloaded several \"action\" movies from Amazon Prime.  The surround sound appeared to be accurate.If any readers can suggest any very good Amazon Prime movies to additionally test the surround sound capability, I will gladly test and report the results.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ex-bomber guy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love the Amazon Fire TV stick!

I wanted to get a Roku box for a long time, but couldn't justify the high price. So when Amazon introduced this product I jumped on it.I've had the product for well over 5 months. I keep using it more and more over the Xbox and PS3 for streaming services. I don't have to turn on any devices or do anything special. All I need to do is change inputs on my tv and the Fire TV stick will fire right up.I love how I can install KODI onto the device, which adds a whole new dimension to the experience.In regards to streaming quality, it is fast and great. Videos streamed from Amazon and Netflix are at 1080p automatically when the applications are launched. There is no slow build up of 480 to 720 to 1080p like on my PS3.All in all, a wonderful product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisa Yang"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Netflix, Prime right at our fingertips, and absolutely no more infomercials", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susan H.
