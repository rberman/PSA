[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "We got our first stick as a combo when purchasing Sling TV. I plugged it into our HDMI port and into the wall for power and got nothing. No welcome screen, nothing. Our TV found it fine, but still blank screen. I searched online about older Samsung TVs (which we have) and thought that might be the issue. Eventually, after trying everything I could, I called customer support.After getting through to the third layer of support, I talked to a woman who agreed to send me out a new one to make sure mine wasn't defective. I got it, plugged it in and it was fine. Never had any issues since. Turns out the first one I received must have had something wrong with it. So, in case this is the same for you and you've done all your troubleshooting, contact them and get a replacement.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "shawn washburn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i really enjoy my fire stick! the pbs app is cool for kids and i've been having fun discovering. i want to game remote though!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ms Mj"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "still needs a few more channel options, especially the History channel", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "thomas garner"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Really like the easy to set this up.
