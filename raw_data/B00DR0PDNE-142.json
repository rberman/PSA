[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own two Chromcast devices. It is awesome to be able to cast Netflix, Hulu, and various apps like Daily Burn. The one negative would be against Amazon for not having Prime Video compatibility; however since I have a relatively new Android tablet running 4.4.2 I can mirror with Sound which is nice. Chromecast is a very easy install, and simple concept to master. We have an iPad and Andriod Phones and tablet, all which work very well with the chromecast. For the newer users: chromecast is like cable box for online apps. Your phone / device act like a remote, and simply point the chromecast to the right 'channel' being a web address. This is perfect for all age groups, as long as high speed wireless internet is available. Also, save money over a smart TV and simply plug this in. We don't have cable, so this has been an integral part of out TV experience. Even with a 7 Mpbs connection, we can stream HD. I have used a PS3, a sony smart dvd player, smart tvs, phillips smart dvd player, and Amazon Firestick. So far this has been my favorite. Also the screensaver pics when not in use are very nice, but can be pointed to a personal library.

The only complaint I have is that it is not as easy as it could be to switch the network it is using.  This only becomes a big deal if you use it with a projector like I do and you are using it at different locations (like at my brother or sisters house).  Maybe I'm just doing something wrong, but I have to go through the setup process again each time I change networks (only a couple minutes, but still).  But it is a great product at a killer price and I would definitely buy it again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael S. \"Engineer\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works as advertized", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joseph Hummer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I don't like that you must use a device in order to do whatever you whant", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Pablo Colombo"}]
