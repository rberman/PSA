After reading everything that it was supposed to do, it definitely sounded like a winner. So when my stick arrived early, it felt like Christmas!Let me preface this by saying that I have a Roku, 2 Chromecasts, Smart TVs, Wiis, Xboxes, and a WDTV Live (not all in the same rooms, of course). So I've got a lot to compare it to!The initial set-up was easy. Plug into the HDMI port on the TV.  Plug it into the wall.  Put the batteries in the remote (now this was a bit of a challenge...I had the hardest time getting it to open!). Good to go.  Now, the registering should have been easy. It was a gift to me from my cousin, so it was tied to her Amazon account. No biggie. I'll just connect it to mine.  Or will I?  When I initially put in my email address, it kept displaying an error saying that it was not a valid email address.  What?! The letters on the screen were pretty huge, and my vision is great...after reading and rereading to figure out where the problem was, I erased a few of the characters and retyped them. And it went through.  Okay.  *whew*Then I input my password.  Yay!  Let's go.  Oops...NO.  It then tells me that the username/password isn't tied to an Amazon account.  WHAT?!  Of course it is!  Unfortunately, the Fire Stick didn't seem to care what I screamed at it, so I had to use the remote (which takes some time getting used to, because I accidentally kept pressing the wrong letter/number). It told me to re-enter my username and password. But I didn't. I simply pressed Okay on both screens to use what was already there (the values that I had input before).  And this time it worked.  What the heck?!  Um...all right.Now we're in business. I can't wait to check everything out!  Apps first. I was a little disappointed at the selection, since I didn't see HBO GO (or a few other apps that I can't remember right now).  And for some reason, the Lifetime App give me all of the full episodes with my TV provider (or any major one like Xfinity, AT&T;, DirectTV). Why not?! It works on my Roku!  Ugh...On to Hulu. I'm trying to activate my account on the computer, when my TV shuts off.  That's no good.  I turn it on, and it happens again.  Is the Fire Stick killing my TV?!  Let's hope not. I went into the TV settings and changed my CEC settings to Off. Not sure why, but it did stay on a little longer after that. And then it was bedtime.This morning, I'm ready to get on the Amazon Fire Stick again, hoping that I have better luck.  I turned my TV on...and it went right back off.  Whoa!  Maybe my brain isn't awake yet and it didn't really come in.  I press power again and the TV logo comes up and I see the Fire Stick screen...and then it disappears and the power light fades out.  No bueno!  Next time I turn the TV on, I quickly switch my input to the cable box.  Okay, the TV stays on.At this point I'm thinking that the Fire Stick might possibly be possessed by the devil. But I'm determined to cast him OUT of my device, so I won't give up.  I switch the TV input back to the Fire Stick, and it works this time without the TV shutting off.  YAY!  So now I'm watching Australia's Next Top Model. That'll surely get the devil to leave...So in conclusion (hahaha)...*  The registration process can be a little buggy at times.*  For some reason, the device might make your TV shut off. It may be remedied by making sure your TV is turned on to an input other than the Amazon Fire Stick.*  The number of apps are limited, but it's a new device, so hopefully they'll have more in the near future.*  The network permissions for the apps may not be the same as it is on your other devices. I suppose the cable providers aren't yet too approving of the Fire Stick.  :(*  The picture quality is great.*  The remote will take a little getting used to.  And the center/ok button can be a bit sensitive. It also might be hard to get the battery cover off.Perhaps I'll re-review after I've used it for a while. But overall, I can't be mad because I paid $19 for it...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "ShaRhanda Bynum \"ShaRhanda R.

Set-up is a breeze, and the interface is easy to navigate.My Amazon account was pre-initialized based on the order, which was a nice surprise.The Netflix app is not pre-installed, you have to download it and then use the alphabet-picker interface to sign into your account.Had a few stutters in the refresh on the main screen.There is no \"reboot\" or shutdown option, but you can put it to sleep.Comes with Plex app for sharing home media.  I should mention that what you see is a list of available apps, you have to select them and download.It says it has 5GB of free space, which I assume will be consumed by additional downloads.Amazon Prime is preloaded of course, and each video or episode is marked with a \"Prime\" logo, which means you can watch it for free if you have a Prime account.I believe the OS is android and it is very similar to kindle HD, etc.  You can enable \"developer\" mode, which activates debugger output and appears to allow you to side-load apps (I haven't tried it yet).It comes with a short HDMI cable and charger with micro USB cable, which is a very nice value for the price.  I didn't need the HDMI shorty as I had enough room to plug it in directly.So now I have like 10 ways to watch netflix:  smart TV, roku, TIVO, firestick, android tablet, IOS devices...This is convenient, though, even if you have a smart TV, because you can flip between display sources and apps by just flipping through the input sources.  This is way faster than starting an app on the smart TV, and then going to a different source, because you have to exit the app and then restart it after changing.  Having a dedicated source means you can pick up where you left off.I've had other HDMI sticks and this is the best one so far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "tremlabs"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kiki"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Low quality.

In general, I feel the thoughts of \"sluggishness\" is somewhat unfounded - I have not noticed any significant slowness as compared to my living room box.One item to note:  My wi-fi signal is max, with the AP connected to 75/75 Mbps over a Gigabit LAN.  So if the stick is making ajax or other calls to the amazon servers, other peoples' signals/networks may be the reason for the sluggishness.One other item to note:  Today my stick lost contact with my AP.  It would connect then immediately disconnect.  I rebooted my AP and the same behavior existed.  I then rebooted the stick, and it was able to connect again.
