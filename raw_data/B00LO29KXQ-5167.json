[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've been a member of Amazon Prime since it was introduced, and this little stick allows me to take advantage of the movies offered by that service, plus a host of others including Hulu, Netflix, Crackle and so forth. It was super easy to install, and I love that I can move it from one room to another and watch anything I want wherever I am. I got the Fire TV Stick after I got my ASUS RT-AC66U Gigabit Router and they work very well together. Between this and my Direct TV which gives me access to my Pandora and YouTube accounts, I'm all set when it comes to media. This Fire Stick was a fantastic idea. You can bring it anywhere as long as you have access to a high-speed wi-fi network.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.
