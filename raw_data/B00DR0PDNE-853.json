Most other apps have a disconnect function but Netflix does not, so if you use Netflix a lot, connecting and disconnecting from Chromecast is slightly annoying. Sometimes we can't get our shows to stop or pause very easily - maybe someone from Netflix will read this and fix their issue. I also don't like that there isn't a remote included with Chromecast, but overall it works perfectly for casting shows to your TV.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sarasoda1"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Economical and efficient.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Duane Reade"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Good But limited use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ashu"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "not work , because i have access point in my home", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Majid"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to set up and use ...
