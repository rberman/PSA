After months of research and comparing it to Roku and Chromecast, i finally ordered it on Prime Day for $20. Best purchase ever! I think i may cancel cable tv but going to test the waters first. I wish i didnt wait so long to get one.  The best feature is I can now view all my IP surveillance cams on my TV! Love everything about it. No cons yet. Pull the trigger and get one.  I know it may sound like I'm affiliated with Amazon (I'm not) but I'm getting the Amazon Echo next when it goes on sale next.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amit"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Setup and use very simple.

I do not like that fact that you have to supply power to the unit.  Makes for a messy and cumbersome setup.  Plus, the cord they provide is not long enough.  Performance is good and fast.  Don't believe and of the articles you read about wirelessly connecting to other game controllers.  If you can even get it to connect, the lag is very bad.  The best part is easy access to my prime lineup.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott S"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "ANDREW", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "\ud83c\udf04"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "really convenient.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "unsure"}]
