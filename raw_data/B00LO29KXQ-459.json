I'm very disgusted with high priced garbage TV. Too expensive for what I'm being offered. Amazon Fire Stick is a much less expensive alternative to cable. I purchased an amazon flat screen antenna for the basic channels. I use the Amazon Fire Stick and subscribe to Sling TV which offers 21 channels of good live TV and subscribe to Netflix. Many other apps are available on the Amazon Fire Stick such as You Tube, Hulu, etc. This works for me. \ud83d\ude04", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stella C."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing...Fast, easy setup, user friendly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gerald Mitchell \"1951 Nash\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Plugged it in.

Needless to say, the Amazon Fire TV Stick is more responsive and faster than the blu-ray player that I was using before.

I bought it for my daughter's room so she could watch cartoons, but it never made it past my room. I was setting it up and it was super easy. The instructions were very simple and I also had an on screen guide. It is very easy to use and I have all the video and tv apps I use right at my fingertips. I watch this all the time instead of satellite tv. if it weren't for my husband (and football), I would cancel my satellite subscription. I am extremely happy with this purchase and plan on buying another one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amanda A"}]
