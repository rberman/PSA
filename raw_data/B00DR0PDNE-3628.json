I've ended up with a HTPC and never been happier.  However, I thought the Chromecast was worth a try due to its small form factor and low price.The device came very neatly packaged, much like most Apple products.  I knew HDMI v1.4 was required to power the device, but I had not taken the time to research my TV's capability.  The device did not power up immediately, so I knew I needed to add power via the supplied micro USB cable.Once powered up I followed the instructions listed on my screen and used my iPhone (4S model, iOS 6.1.3) to setup.  I found some of the prompted steps lacking information and struggled to change the SSID of my router but realized I should be changing my phone to connect to the Chromecast SSID. Not a big deal, whoever expected electronics instructions to be well written? However this is where the problem began.The Chromecast found the appropriate wireless network and asked for password.  After six attempts, it finally accepted my password and I was able to move on.  I was then prompted to switch back to the internet connected SSID.  This took three tries without avail before I went back to the Chromecast SSID to re-perform the previous step.  It finally connected on this fourth (or is it 10th try?)My iPhone then told me how I could use my Chromecast through my phone.  I tried the Chrome browser at first, but there was no mirror capability present. I guess Google hasn't pushed an App update out yet, no big deal.  I then tried Netflix (the main reason for the Chromecast in my opinion,) and found the mirror feature ready and waiting.  This was the only positive thing I've seen yet with the device.  However things continued downhill from there.I selected a show and it just  hung (loading) for over a minute before I backed out to try again.  On second try the show synced and started playing.  The resolution was poor (480) as the buffer needed to fill to get to high definition (1080.)  HD was enabled within the first 30 seconds, but that's when I noticed the real failure of the device: audio sync.  The audio-video sync was off, enough to make me cease watching. I've yet to determine the offset needed to sync, but I wound expect much, much better from a plug'n'play device from Google.  Pausing and restarted did not improve the sync issues.I turned off the Chromecast and booted my HTPC.  I had high hopes for the Chromecast, but an HTPC cannot be beat.I'll try Chromecast in another few months, hopefully things improve.UPDATE 8/8/2013: After applying update 12480 I saw no improvement in the audio sync.  However I did discover that the direct cause of the audio sync issue was due to selecting a show on Netflix that I had already watched one half.  After selecting new content to start from the beginning, the audio was properly synced.  I've increased my rating to three stars as this is a less obnoxious bug now that I've identified the direct cause.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/11", "author": "MWA"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I just received my Chromecast,and after having used it for a little while, I am must say that this is an amazing little piece of hardware!

I can live with the fact that Google does everything they can to hid the electric plug.  Did you also know it only works with Google Chrome, which I hate.  They make you think that with a PC you can stream almost anything--not so.  I was hoping to stream WatchESPN from my PC to my TV rather than having to put my PC near the TV and plug it in with HDMI.  Other streaming websites such the History Channel will not allow you to do 2 things with your PC as Google advertises.  That only works with the very few sites/up Google has setup such as Netflix and YouTube.  I can watch those on my Internet Ready DVD player.  They kept this quite so that other competitors would not put this on the market and they could saturate the market.  As smart TVs become cheaper, this will no longer be needed--not that it serves any usefull purpose now.  They did a lot of misleading customers in their advertising so they could sell as many as fast before people really know what they are getting.  This will end up in a drawer immediately, and one day I will throw it away when I clean out that drawer. Streaming quality is the poorest of any device I have. That was $35 wasted!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "13/46", "author": "Jeff"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I've seen others saying that the Chromecast can be powered via the HDMI ports on some TVs, specifically televisions with HDMI 1.4 ports. I didn't find this to be the case. I have also not seen anyone else that has said their Chromecast could be powered by their HDMI port, only people claiming it is possible -- so this thing might require USB power regardless of your television, if that's a deal-breaker for you then take note. I didn't find the power-supply an issue though, as my television has a USB port that I was able to use to power the Chromecast.  (Edit: from the comments below, it looks like some TVs can power the device with HDMI alone. I can confirm, however, that it will *not* work with all HDMI 1.4 ports, as my television has HDMI 1.4 and Chromecast requires USB power)If you plan to use the device for tab-streaming: your mileage may vary. I found that the quality of tab streaming was acceptable when my Chromecast had a strong wifi reception and I was using my Mid 2012 Macbook Air. When using my Mid 2010 Macbook pro or when I had a poor wifi connection, the quality of tab-streaming was unacceptable. Keep in mind that this thing is going to be connected behind your television, so it's already going to have poor wifi reception because of the interference. They include the mini HDMI extension to help improve the wifi problems, but it doesn't help much. I really wish that the wifi built into the device were of higher quality.My primary use-case is Netflix. Netflix works great. The experience is close to perfect on iOS and Android devices. I've tested it on my Nexus 4 and my iPad 2, and both apps allow me to designate that I want to watch content on my Chromecast *before* I start playing it. I can even switch devices, Nexus 4 to iPad2, or vise-versa and control the show that I have in progress from the other device.The Netflix experience from their website, however, is a major step down. In order to play content on the Chromecast, you first need to start playing the content locally -- this means the content needs to buffer twice. Netflix's website does not recognize that I've already got something streaming on my Chromecast, so if I've started content on my Nexus 4 or iPad, there's no way for me to control that content from the Netflix website (you can do the opposite, however). Hopefully this is something that Netflix fixes, and isn't really a knock against the Chromecast itself, except to say that your experience will only be as good as the support from the provider integrated with Chromecast -- and overall, Netflix does a pretty good job.YouTube buffers a lot. At first I thought there might be something wrong with my device -- and then I remembered that YouTube buffers a lot when I view it on the web too. All in all, YouTube is a pretty horrible experience for anything longer than a 3-minute clip -- and how often am I going to cast a 3-minute clip to my television?I am a developer. I've started playing with the Chromecast SDK. The potential power of this device is amazing. I've managed to create a slide deck that displays on my Chromecast that I can control via my computer -- but that's definitely on the lower-end of the possibilities with this device. I'm not the only one developing for Chromecast, both Pandora and HBO have apps in the work, and I look forward to seeing them work with this device soon.Finally and this last one is more of a wishlist item: Google has been rumored to be working on a streaming television service. I see the Chromecast as the perfect platform for their ambitions, and I hope this is the route they take. Imagine that your cable-box is the Chromecast, and your TV guide / DVR lives in the cloud and you access it from your device. Want to watch content on one of the TV channels offered via Google's service? Just click the cast button next to that channel in the guide and the channel begins streaming live to your television.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "J.

Quality of content varies depending on who recorded it so NetFlix is exceptionally great and YouTube depends on who recorded the clip you are watching.  I have't tried other apps yet as this is enough to keep me in content for quite awhile.  Simple setup, just plugged it in, downloaded the Chromecast app on my smartphone, set up user ID & password, then downloaded the Netflix and YouTube apps to start & Que-up movies or other content and then turn off the phone.
