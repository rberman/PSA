Easy to use - lots of content available - even music from my Amazon Prime - and Netflix - and Amazon's own original programming.  Working my way through Alpha House right now - finished season one - great comedy - on Amazon Prime.  My son visited recently and was amazed at how much better and easier to use this Fire Stick is than Google Chromecast.  Was a very well spent $35.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dudley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was easy to set up! I love it.
