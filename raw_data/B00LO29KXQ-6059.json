However the Fire Stick was not one of them that impressed me. There is a lot of scrolling to find anything. You need to connect your Android/Fire device to the stick to have voice command. Maybe they will include apps for other OS's but at this time is quite limited.Its mainly an apps device. If you do not have a gaming console/tv/DVD/BlueRay player with app support then this device may be for you but at this time its only good for apps and only sort of good - back to the scrolling issue. I have an xbox that fills the need for apps. I honestly purchased this since I saw that it had Miracast support to wirelessly cast my display onto the tv. Well, after hooking it all up and researching it is only for again, Android and their Fire devices. I was hoping to have the ability to cast my Windows 8 computer display onto the tv. Sorry - no support. At least at this time. Did some research and could not find whether they were looking to expand support on Miracast.I purchased two but am really considering returning both. I am very sure I will be returning one at the least so I can have a portable app player wherever I go. That way I don't need to sign into everyone's tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "James \"James\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Completely conflicts with my tv and Apple TV.
