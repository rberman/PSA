I cannot watch Netflix movies with it. Every time I try it says \"IDCP unauthorized. Content disabled.\" But I can hear the movie! When I first got it I could watch Netflix. Now I can't. Very disappointed Cannot watch Sho anytime either because Comcast will not authorize. All the Amazon Prime movies I can watch on my laptop, now I must pay to watch with the Fire TV Stick even though I'm signed into Amazon Prime and my watch list even come up on the TV screen. It worked for one day...now nothing but lame old indieflix. WOW do not waste ur money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tabi Rexford"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works Great!

I already owned a Chrome Cast so, I was able to stream Hulu, Youtube, Netflix but was missing Amazon Instant streaming. The fire stick allowed me to access all subscriptions.  I was excited and then... I was let down, every show I watched would loose quality and freeze but the sound would continue. My bandwidth is fine, everyone in the house wasn't using the internet at the time, and my husband is a software engineer for a cable company so we have the top of the line of internet service.  I never had this problem with my Chrome cast and have since went back to using it along with my x box for amazon prime instant streaming.  I'm disappointed and makes me a very sad panda.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sarah"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great device for utilizing a slingbox from any TV without having to use any intermediate device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert Girot"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great Unit...
