I wish I seem them for $19.00 when they had them on special. Cheaper than the ROKU device. Smart Phone app works fine. Take it out of the box and plug it in. Follow on screen details and you are good to start watching. I use Netflix and Amazon Prime for movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

You must download apps such as Netflix to watch Netflix. A bit different concept than the Apple TV I have which comes with everything pre-installed.  The Netflix app is a bit different than Apple.  The music on Prime consists of only existing playlists.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works awesome!
