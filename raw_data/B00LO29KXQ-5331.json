We use it on a tv in the bedroom that has no cable outlet or box and it allows us to stream shows and movies easily. Previously, I would stream amazon though my kindle, which also works well, but the kindle had to stay plugged into the tv with an HDMI so I would have to get up to browse for shows to watch. The fire stick has a remote which allows me to be truly lazy and flip through content from wherever I am in the room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amanda M."}]
