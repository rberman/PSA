The only \"negative\" comment that I have would be that I wish there was a way to turn it off or set a sleep timer for when there is a certain length of inactivity. I leave it plugged in all the time so that would be great. It's a tedious process to put it to sleep too. Have to scroll down and over to get to the settings where the sleep option happens to be hiding. I'd love it if the remote had a sleep/off button.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "V.
