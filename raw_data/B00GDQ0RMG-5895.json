[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my Fire TV Stick! I just got it the other day, much earlier than expected too. I couldn't wait to get it set up and try it out. It works PERFECTLY!!!! I am an Amazon Prime member so all the extra movies are awesome. It's very easy to search a movie by name. Saving shows or movies to your watch list is easy too. And the fact that it doesn't take up any space, it just plugs into the back of my TV. Now I just need to find a remote that will work Dish Network, the volume for my sound bar, and be able to toggle between HDMI settings without using five remotes! If anyone has a suggestion, please let me know. I need to consolidate!! But get the Amazon Fire TV Stick...It is Amazing!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "~AW"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good product. Works better than chromecast for sure. As the ios app comes up, i will be using it more frequently for sure.

Have been getting the blue screen of death every few minutes when we attempt to stream any videos.  It has audio but no picture. We will be returning it.Also we have the fire box and love it but the sick is just a waste of monies until it is fixed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Scarlett R."}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Worst streaming product that I have bought to date. Shows a lot of promise but the remote that they provided does not work - it just keeps pushing me to the home screen and none of the other buttons are functional - and when I try and use the remote app it often times fails to find my Fire Stick. Very disappointed and contemplating sending it back. I expected more from Amazon", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "BBallCardShark"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love love love!! It was so simple to set up, streaming is very fast. I've never had any issues with streaming quality or freezing during an episode or movie. I got it for the Amazon prime promo price but would easily have paid $39 for it! It's wonderful!!! Highly recommend!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Holly Brisson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent portable streaming stick and having the remote included is great, I love Chromecast but I'm not a fan of using my phone to control that device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "V.G."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "google chromecast is much more diverse and pratical since I can mirror from my phone", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The price is the best thing about.Some apps that are free on Ruko cost on the fire stick.So for me it is incomplete,I have two Kuko boxes. So if your interested check to see which is a better deal for you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lorenzo"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Overall, the Fire TV Stick is a good product.  The picture (even on my 60\" screen) and audio (I have a digital audio cable leading from my TV to my receiver) quality are in line with other streaming options.  However, the big downfall to this product is the ASAP delivery of your preferred content.  I was contacted by my provider about the dramatic increase in my bandwidth usage and was close to exceeding the monthly cap, which I wasn't truly aware of before, after only a WEEK of using the Stick at the end of November.  I work remote frequently, via a highly secured VPN, and have used multiple Apple TVs in the house for years without ever being close to the bandwidth cap.  Again... one week with the Stick and I was about to start shelling out for overage fees.  For the first part of December I just looked and was shocked to see it had already taken me to 25% of the cap for this month!  I don't even use the Stick daily!  Amazon needs to offer the option to turn off the ASAP delivery of content.  Maybe then I'd give this three or four stars....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "M.
