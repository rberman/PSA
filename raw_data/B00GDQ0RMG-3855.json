I think it is the best thing I have ever had! I quit my cable...I still have the very basics of it, but teh Amazon Fire TV stick is just so freaking awesome easier to install than the roku.. The roku ended up not working for me, therefore I just returned it and got the Amazon fire TV stick. I am just so amazed by it. It took me less than five minutes to install. I have hulu andnetflix and what is great is the learning stuff on it as well. I love it!Thank you so much!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ariana matos"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works good and best option for the money by far.
