Flipping through menus is speedy. It did take me a little bit to grasp the interface as I also own/use a Roku 2 XD. The interface confusion is caused by amazon content being accessed though main menu screens while other content can only be accessed once you start an app. When you look at your recent activity you will see Amazon videos you have watched plus other apps.I do not use the supplied power adapter (Cord is too short to reach the surge protector on the other side of entertainment center. Problem is my setup; not cord length) When I power off my TV the Fire stick powers down too. This is a slight annoyance because I have to restart Netflix to get back to what I was watching the night before.Waiting for iOS app and the ability to screen share from any device, including PC. I will add/remove stars accordingly if/when these features are added.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joe McVicker"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it and so easy to set up", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "willik5@mail.auburn.edu  Ed Williams"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

Two applications can extend the FS capabilities into those normally found in a Home Theater PC; Plex (app available for 5 bux) and Kodi (XBMC).  All the info you could want can be found on YouTube by searching on those apps.  Plex requires installation of it's Free Plex Server software on a PC or MAC and Kodi/XBMC requires side loading an app:- stream all sorts of media from your local network & media server, including movies, TV shows, photos, music- stream the same set of media from the web (checkout tvAddOns Wizard for an easy Kodi comprehensive install and also \"Plex unsupported Appstore Installer\")Two add-on capabilities make this operation much simpler/possible;-  side loading apps  (search \"sideloading FireTV\" on YouTube for many detailed videos)  basic computer skills are recommended.-  pairing a bluetooth keyboard / touchpad device (most bluetooth devices work after the settings.app is side loaded; I used the QQ-Tech\u00ae Mini Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard.Sideloaded app examples: Kodi, XBMC, Chrome / Dolphin browsers, settings.apk, ES File Explorer, game emulators, etc.  Nobody should expect a stellar experience using the FS as a browser but it works after a fashion and gets certain jobs done very well indeed.None of these require any \"rooting\" of the FS device.  Be forewarned that such extended capabilities come with numerous bugs and issues that are mostly only annoyances eg using keyboard and remote at same time has weird extra scrolling issues, channels that do not always work properly.  Your FS HTPC will require and reward your ongoing maintenance efforts as nothing on the net stays the same forever.I would be happy to answer questions and make recommendations based on my limited experience.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Twanna Martin"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The one key missing feature of the Fire TV Stick is that it doesn't support browser-based wifi authentication.Which means you won't be able to use it on the road, in hotels specifically. The idea of a portable Fire TV is great, but actually taking it with me on a business trip and hoping to be able to watch Amazon Prime or listen to Prime Music, I was left without any way to connect it to wifi.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Carl"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If I could give this ten stars I would- we thought we were awesome using Chromecast (and it is awesome) but this is like the Cadillac of Chromecast! It is optimized for Amazon Prime and also offers a variety of other TV/movie services (like Netflix and Hulu) and even music with Pandora (I can't comment on the music because we haven't tried that feature yet). My hubby did all the setting up and even our six year old can use the remote and menu to choose shows he likes to watch. The menu reminds me of the Xbox live menu- it's very user friendly and the remote is simple and easy to use. It might not be ideal for someone with poor eyesight because the buttons are kinda small, but there are so few of them, I would think you could easily remember what is where in time. Overall, this is a wonderful piece of technology and worth every penny!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BookNoseRose"}]
