I've used pretty much every streaming device on the market, including building my own HTPC.  This is the quickest device I've used, with the only drawback being it only has a 5gb hard drive.  This isn't an issue until you start downloading large games.  When you fill the hard drive the performance takes a hit and it may lag.  As soon as you have the ability to save the game to an external hard drive, this device will get 5 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian Lawson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've been using Amazon Prime for a while now, and since I don't pay for television it is the primary way I watch streaming content on my television.  However, the internet browser version of the service leaves much to be desired.  So when the Fire TV was announced, I had just one simple question, \"How does it compare to using my computer?\"I have almost entirely nice things to say about this box, glowing even, so let me start off with the bad.  The power adapter is large, which wouldn't be an issue but it is one of those boxes that either has to go at the end of a power strip or its going to cover up an outlet.  I cannot believe manufactures still produce this design, it looks good on paper I'll bet but it just isn't practical for people who have a lot of electronic devices connected to their televisions.  Secondly, when I first booted it up it needed an update.  So close, Amazon, just sooooooo close.  It is already linked to your Amazon account, so setting this thing up is super easy.  That said, there is no good reason this thing should come out of the box needing an update, especially considering it was JUST released.  If that hadn't been the case it would've taken five minutes to set this thing up, and most of that was the introduction video.That unpleasantness out of the way, I must say I'm floored.  I've been using computers for the last twenty years, and so when I say this thing is a joy to use I don't mean compared to Linux.  I'm a big fan of modern user interfaces and the Fire TV has one of the best interfaces I've used.  It's consistent, it's responsive and most of all it gives you access to what you want very quickly.  The controller is eight buttons, and all of them are immediately useful and understandable.  My favorite part is everything is quick.  Setup (minus the patch) was quick, powering on is quick, navigating menus and making selections is quick.  Anyone who has used Google Play, iOS, XBox Marketplace or PS4 Shop knows what its like to wait for your selections to load.  Somehow, Fire TV does not have that problem.  Images load before I get to them, and descriptions and actions are available as soon as you click the select button.  The only 'slow' bit is the voice search and it is still incredibly quick.  So far it has worked FLAWLESSLY, a compliment I am hesitant to give, but I am simply impressed.  Actor names, move titles, genres; the search works amazingly and the best part is it works CORRECTLY.  It isn't perfect, Luc Besson needed to be pronounced \"bess-on\", but I was shocked he came up with a 'literal' pronunciation.Lastly, the box is a great price.  It's clear Amazon brought their big guns to the table because this box absolutely hit it out of the park for me.  I worry that in the future when Fire TV 2 comes around (we'll be lucky to get a year) this box will have been swamped with unnecessary updates that make it run slow and misbehave, but I guess I can keep my fingers crossed.  It's too early to tell, but that should be a concern for every buyer.  It works great NOW, and I am completely pleased with my purchase, but will Amazon be the first company to let this box age safely on my TV stand?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Devon Mullane"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have frontier internet, my only choice in my rural area. The speed is so bad we can't stream Netflix or YouTube. I took a chance on this device knowing I could send it back and not expecting it to work for me. I am a die hard Amazon fan. The only Apple device you will find here is my daughter's iPod touch. And that is only until Amazon comes out with something comparable. I plugged this device in and updated the software easily. The streaming options loaded we picked a movie and to my surprise it started playing. No waiting. No buffering. No long painful pauses.

Shell \"Bambi V\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Amazon Fire was purchased to replace a lightning damaged Roku. I own a Apple TV streamer as well but it will not play Amazon Prime movies.The Pros:It worked out of the box and as a Amazon Prime subscriber it came with my ID information programed. It was a simple HDMI cable to the TV and plug into a wall outlet. After a few moments of software updating and watching an instructional video (could have bypassed) it was ready to go. No need to enter codes on a PC to activate my account like was necessary for both the Apple an Roku boxes.The menus were snappy and the voice search worked better than expected. The Fire has all the other major movie and video services seen on the Apple and Roku with the exception of HBOgo that many have voiced complaints.The Cons:The Fire looked good until I tried to play an actual movie. I first tried Netflix. The menu came up quickly and after hitting the play button it looked like it was going to play.  However after several moments I get an error message. The gist of the message was an inability to handle HDCP, High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection. Switched to the Amazon account and get the same error message. Tried playing the same movie on the Apple TV and it worked fine. I then swapped cables and HDMI inputs on the the TV with no result. The Fire would not play movies from Netflix or Amazon.(Perhaps I should have prefaced this review with the fact that I am a retired computer engineer and understand the technical aspects of cable losses due to frequency, capacitance and shielding better than most.)  After a little reading and thought I placed the Fire on a much shorter HDMI cable (3 foot) next to the TV as a test. It worked fine. I questioned why both the Apple TV and Roku TV streamers had no problems with my cabling configuration. The answer is in the cables or more specific in the HDMI standards. The Apple TV and the Roku both use HDMI 1.3 while the Fire uses HDMI standard 1.4. Several important and technical differences but suffice it to say that you should use cables supporting the HDMI 1.4 standard for lengths exceeding 15 feet. This requirement will become more important in the future with 4K videos and increased use of 3D content.My second con will not affect many but is of concern if viewing podcast videos is a part of your streaming needs. The only provider (to date) is Revision3. There are many more offering content appealing to a broad cross section of interest. Both the Roku and Apple boxes had the full complement of channels but in my option the Apple TV has a better menu system to access podcast channels.Some love the menu layout. I view it somewhat cumbersome compared to the Apple. The menu format used on the Fire is very much like that of the Roku which I also found less than sterling.Other thoughts. If into games then the Fire will beat both the Apple and Roku. I'm not a gamer but quickly recognized that the Fire will not replace full TV gaming systems like the Xbox which cost hundreds more. The voice search is nice but be aware that the searches are only on Amazon content. That makes sense because I doubt that Netflix, and others, will give Amazon free access to their database.Each of these streamers have their uniqueness in strengths and weaknesses. This could be your box but be aware of the need for HDMI 1.4 cables. If within 15 feet or so then the cheaper cables will do the job. Try stretching to 25 feet, as in my case, and problems will arise using HDMI 1.3 and older cables. Most folks will be within 15 feet so it should not be a problem.If watching podcast videos are a need then this box will not fill your bill. Perhaps in the future but currently there is little content in that area.My original rating of the Fire was 3 stars. I have upped that to 4 stars because I did not understand the need for HDMI 1.4 cabling at the lengths I required.
