It set up easy and the tutorial was easy to follow for her. It's been a week now and she's pretty much proficient in using the Fire TV Stick. I'm very happy I purchased this for her because at least now she can use my Netflix and Amazon Prime to watch her shows and not spend hours calling me asking how to set up the Roku.Another convenient thing that does is that it shows up as a Fire TV Stick on the Samsung menu list when using the source or input button. This makes it very easy for my mother to find the correct device so that she isn't floundering between them until it shows up. She goes right to it and begins watching.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Shane M."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Vey reliable product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "joseph"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My wife has been telling me about this Fire TV Stick for months she told me all about how easy it is to install and all the Movies TV and so much more you can access from a small Fire Stick that just plugs into the TV. It seemed to good to be true. No way this could be for real. Then much to my surprise a small box from Amazon showed up on my doorstep. Yes she bought the Amazon Fire TV Stick. I opened the box plugged  it in and soon realized dreams do come true. I kiss my wife every day now ever since I got my Fire TV Stick.

Figure it would be a great portable way to use all of our streaming content on any TV we have near an internet source.  Works great for that...with a few oddities.PROs:1) It's very small.  Plugs into the TV and you can't see it.2) It has all of the streaming services that we use.3) It does games (gaming pad required for some games-sold separately)4) It's very simple to set up and use.  Includes a good demoCONs:1) The TV ad makes it seem that the HDMI powers it.  In reality, you need to plug a usb power cable in to provide power to the device.  Yes, it may be stupid to deduct a star for this, but it really is just a smaller device that still requires the same power cord.2) The demo has no real way to skip it.  Not a big deal, but it's a tad annoying when you want to watch some streaming content, go to set this up and have to go through a 10 minute demo first.Overall, we love the device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Allison & Bill Dunn \"Alli\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it, super easy set up!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Connie Rincon"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It stops working all of the time.
