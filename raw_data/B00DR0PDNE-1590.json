[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is the second chromecast I own. It works great. Occasionally the netflix app freezes as I switch devices but I think that is more of a Netflix flaw than a chromecast flaw. Maybe once a month it needs rebooted but thats as simple as unplugging and replugging it in. Not a big deal to me.
