I already have a SmartTV but I HATE it. Very slow and hard to navigate.  I just wanted a simple way to watch YouTube and some other random online videos.  This does this perfectly.  Seems like people are split between thinking the smartphone/table/computer is either a good or bad remote.  I think its EXACTLY what I want. I already have tons of smartphones and tablets in the house, I just need a 'dumb' device that would play the content on the TV. Perfect for what I want. If that is not what you want then this device may not be for you.On a side note, this can 'cast' your entire computer screen. There is a option for it. And you can also use this to watch any local video from a Chrome browser as well. So if you really want to watch a file that you have stored to your computer just put C:\\ into your Chrome browser and cast it.Only thing missing for me is the cast button from a mobile browser.

Both devices certainly have their merits, and their price points, but honestly I think only one of them is a winner. A quick word first: I own a MacBook Pro (2007, not Airplay compatible), an iPhone 5 and an iPad. The only Android device in our household, a 2012 Nexus 7, belongs to my brother who is away from home at college. Okay, with that settled, let's put these things through their paces.- Google ChromecastThis $35 set-top-box-on-a-stick streamer is really a lot of great ideas in one. The problem only comes when those ideas don't, or perhaps can't, deliver. Let me start with setup. Google makes it seem like it's a one step process. Well, it's not. At least not for most people.* Step 1: Plug stick in TV. The Chromecast will switch your TV to the correct input and instruct you on how to configure your wifi.- * Optional Step 1a: If the HDMI port on your TV is unable to connect to the Chromecast because it will not fit, connect your device to the included HDMI extender and then connect it to your TV.- * Optional Step 1b: If the Chromecast does not power itself from the Plug the included USB power adapter into your Chromecast and plug it into your TV.- * Optional Step 1c: If your Chromecast does not automatically switch your television to the proper input, this feature may not be available for you and you will need to manually change your television or home theatre system to the proper input.Yup. It's as easy and plug-(and optionally plug)-and-play. Not the end of the world really, but you guys have no idea how ugly this sucker looked hanging off the side of my tv, especially with the USB cord dangling off of it. Once I was booted up I had to download and install a piece of software on my computer, that I'll likely only use this once, to configure the wifi on my device. Google says that iOS support for this part is coming soon. After the program installs I'm prompted to do another install, this time for a Chrome extension. Sigh. Okay. A few dialog boxes later I'm setup. Finally.But I'm a long-time user of Google products. Function first, then the pretty finish. And honestly, once your up and running, the UI of the Chromecast is pretty nice. Quick sidebar: We've got a Roku in our living room and I'd never put much thought behind how much I actually used the remote. I've got the Roku remote app on my iPhone and I use it a fair bit, but honestly, for simple pausing and rewinding, the physical remote is great. Now, back to the Chromecast, there is no remote. You must use a compatible app to start playing and control content. For example, my mother, God love her, doesn't carry her phone on her at all times like I do. On Friday, if I decided I didn't want to watch Arrested Development with her anymore, and I walked out of the room, she would have lost her ability to pause or control the show. This is part of the design of the Chromecast, and I honestly don't fault it for it. Is it frustrating? For Netflix? Yes. For tab streaming from Chrome? Not really. Which foreshadows my purchase of an Apple TV.What really peeved me about the Chromecast is that no matter what happens, if I'm using my iOS device, the content I want to push to the Chromecast MUST be available online. Local photo sharing? Nope. Local screen mirroring? Nope. Music? Well, Pandora support is coming... but local music is a no. And no Google Play Music app for iOS means no way for iOS users to play music at all for now.I'm not mad I bought a Chromecast. With the now defunct Netflix offer it was a steal and I look forward to seeing Google make it into something a little more useful than its current state. But honestly, the ideas and promises of the Chromecast made me lust after something else. Something that does do those things. Something I can buy today. And I did.- Apple TV (3rd Generation, rev A)From setup to boot up I never found myself wondering why I had to do something. The only thing missing from the box is an HDMI cable, which I keep a spare of anyways. The Chromecast does include all potential accessories, which is a nice surprise, but I don't won't give the Apple TV any marks off for not since none of the other set-top-streamers don't. Connecting to the wifi was easier than on the Chromecast since I could do it from my TV using the included remote. Yeah, a physical remote. I entered the password and then I had a working device.I put my iPhone into Airplay mirroring immediately and was having fun. Then I called my mom over and showed her how to share photos onto the screen (Open Photos app, tab Airplay icon). She picked it up effortlessly. This in contrast to me attempting to explain the Chromecast such that she never understood it.The Apple TV still has limitations, yes, but they're far fewer than that of the Chromecast. I'd like to see an App/Channel store and similarly the ability to hide some of the channels I'm never going to use.- Bottom LineThe fact is, iOS users and owners who have been lusting after an Apple TV but have never wanted to put down the $100 will be disappointed in a Google Chromecast. It just won't deliver the way an Apple TV could.But honestly, everything the Chromecast does Apple TV does better. Chromecast supports Netflix streaming when started from a mobile app, Apple TV lets you browse and start from your TV. Chromecast lets you mirror a browser tab, but Apple TV lets you mirror and entire display from OS X or iOS. So, if you're in the iOS ecosystem it's Apple TV. Accept no pretenders.For my friends on Android, it's probably just a meh. It doesn't do much right now, and for that reason and the Netflix offer ending you shouldn't get in much of a rush and especially if you already have a way to stream Netflix to your TV.And if you still can't decide, there's always the lovable Roku. It sits right in the middle price-wise and has the most to offer for people who honestly don't want to have to use a phone or a tablet to unlock more ways of accessing content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/8", "author": "C. Bromley \"jawenforcement\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I'm a gadget junkie. I already have a Vizio Co-Star, a Roku 2 and numerous smart TVs and Blu-Ray players. So streaming content is not all that new to me but I had to buy the Chromecast because it seemed so simple and open. After playing with it for a few days, it's well worth the $35 price tag and will likely become my default streamer of Netflix and YouTube.Most people now have a smartphone and/or tablet and usually have them within reach at all times. As much as I love my Co-Star, it's yet another clunky remote I have to grab for to utilize it to the max. The Roku remote is small but any searches are a pain in the backside. The Netflix interfaces on my other streaming devices are all stripped down and awful.The simplicity of the Chromecast is why people are going crazy over it. Grab your phone, tablet or computer and you can instantly stream to the device for the official apps or websites. As long as you have a decent router, there's almost no lag from when you input commands into your phone/tablet and when it happens on the screen. Picture is in big beautiful 1080p. The fact that the device can be operated Android and iOS is a butter, as my wife has iPhone and I have Nexus 4. My wife also hates learning how to use my new gadgets, but she learned how to use the Chromecast in about 2 minutes and is happy to bury the Roku & Co-Star remotes out of sight.As others have pointed out, this won't replace other streaming boxes until developers update their apps, but Google is making it pretty simple for them. But for me, I use Netflix and YouTube 95% of the time on my streaming boxes, so this will become my go to device.If this was $75, I'd give it 4 stars because of the lack of other services out the box, but at $35, it's a 5-star pickup and a no-brainer. I ordered two and may order some at work as this will be a nice way to show off my companies YouTube videos or show presentations during meetings without lugging a laptop around or having wires sprawled across the conference room table.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Phenom"}]
