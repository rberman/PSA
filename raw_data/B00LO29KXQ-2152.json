[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is by far the best I have tried! Much better than chromecast. I LOVE the remote option because it gives people the option to use it without having to have access to my phone that has the app!I only wish it had volume control and that you could turn the tv off with the remote. Maybe you can but I havnt figured it out yet. I love that we can turn the tvOn with it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Luvmy4boys"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Control stick is a bit light on useful features, but overall a good purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William Warren"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.
