It seems that to get the most out of the Fire Stick you need Prime also. I tried the Fire Stick on the TV in my bedroom and it says that the wifi connection is week or it will turn off. When I use it on the TV in my living room it works fine. I don't know if it's a problem with the stick, my TV, or my connection. Overall though, I think it's a good product and I enjoy using it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ramon Ibarra"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very nice", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Linda G.
