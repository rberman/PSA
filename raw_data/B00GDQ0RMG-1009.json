[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "We have an pre smart TV at our lake house, we didn't want to invest in a new TV for something we only use occasionally. This was the perfect answer for us. We get the same thing as we get with our smart TV at home at a fraction of the cost to upgrade. The only negative is sometimes our WiFi is slow out in the middle of nowhere but that has nothing to do with the Fire Stick it just something to be aware of.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Heather Pennington"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Tamera Weaver"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The Amazon Fire TV stick is a good product but it's not a great product.  I purchased this during the Prime Day event a couple of weeks ago for about $24.  I have a Roku box at home.  I find the performance of the Amazon Fire TV stick is average at best which is why I gave this three stars.  The on screen menus have a sluggish response especially when viewing HBO GO.  I find the Roku Box slightly better in that regard.  The actual steaming has been choppy in a few occasions and in one instance I've had to reboot the entire device to get better performance.  I've never had to reboot the Roku.I like that the product can be hidden behind the TV.  With my Roku box it's visible and so are the wires connecting it.  The personalized introduction was a nice touch when you first turn it on.  It instructs you on how to use the product.One thing I really like is the screen saver feature.  If you have a movie paused for any length of time really nice images from a variety of places appear.  It's a nice touch.  I also like that I can sync my mobile device to the Fire Stick and type on my device what I am searching for instead of hunting for letters with a remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "D-Rome"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was a little hard to set up, I think because I need a new router, but when I got it set up and figured all the apps out that needed downloaded, it worked great.

While I went on-line to read the instructions, my husband got everything set up. We have some familiarity with tech products (computer, cellphones, tablet) but I found it easy to get the hang of using the product, finding it pretty intuitive. It's opened up a wonderful alternative to cable without the high price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Tina"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Beautiful picture and awesome quality!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Kristin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I didn't think I would like it, but I have been pleasantly surprised with how muck I do enjoy it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "John H.

We don't have satellite/cable service in our younger children's bedrooms or on my TV at my office.  We simply use DVD players to allow them to watch movies.  Now, I can use this and they can watch some more of their favorite shows or movies, without the added cost of the extra DVR boxes or paying for service at my office!  You definitely need a good internet connection, as it streams via the internet, but it's definitely worth the investment.  I love the portability of it, as well!  I take it from home and to work, so it can be used in both places.  I've only had it for a few days, now, but so far it's been great and I'd definitely recommend buying it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Marie V.
