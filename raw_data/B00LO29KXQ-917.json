Watching Strike Back. The chick playing the LtC has great freckles. Great action adventure. Easy to install. But, you will need at least three HDMI slots. My only concern is heat. It feels hot after an evening of viewing. Not sure what that is about. But, all is well. For the price, it's a well worth it. Great value. Buy it.
