The Netflix app's audio/visual is perpetually unsynced and there's no way to search only video or apps included in my subscription, so I'm always finding video that I'd have to pay more for. Ended up feeling more like an advertising platform for pay-per-view-type movie rentals and, at this price, I can get something that works much better with the free platforms AND allows me to rent video as well. Two stars because it wasn't broken, just very disappointing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "J.
