And I don't have to worry about connecting a mobile device to it in order to view movies.  The main reason I picked one up was so I could better stream WWE App shows and events.  No more plugging my PC up to my tv just to watch Wrestlemania.  Connecting to my other streaming media sources like Netflix was also a piece of cake.  Even the fact that I can download apps and games to it with ease was brilliantly done by Amazon.  For anyone who says there are delays in this device when it comes to performance, dont believe the hype.  I've been in IT for 15 years.v if this device is performing slow, it surely has to be the result of your home internet connection.  Im on a 100 MB Xfinity connection.  If youvare on a 1 to 15 MB connection (especially a DSL), then you need to limit the number of additional devices on your network while streaming.  If you don't, then you will probably experuence bufferring delays from time to time as you are maxing out your bandwidth.  This is not Amazon (or even Google's fault for Chromecast users).  But maybe Amazon could have an option for those with slower connections to be able to increase the size of their buffer before streaming begins to help counter this problembfor those with slower connections.  I almost think the Fire Stick has that option, but they may want to look at increasing it some to help overall performance for those with slower connections.My only complaints are that 1) the USB power cable says there is an error everytime I first boot up (which I just ignore it and move on) and 2) I now need to get rid of my Chromecast.
