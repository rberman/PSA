We have Google Chromecast and a Roku and they are both so much faster to navigate through the menus. I don't know if we just got a defective one or what but the Fire stick is drastically slower than the Chromecast (also a stick) and the Roku (set top device, not a stick). We tried using this a few times and set it aside to return because we couldn't take it and I kind of forgot about returning it. I'm 10 days outside of the return period and luckily amazon is still letting me return it - thank goodness. We are going to try the Amazon Fire TV (non-stick) or Apple TV - hopefully they are faster. If not, I guess we will just get another Roku for the other tv!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Kate H."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Has the wifi range as advertised.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Shopper"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Sure glad I got one, much better than Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Gary E.
