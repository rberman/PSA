[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great little device. It has turned a non-smart TV into one that I can easily enjoy any Amazon Content on (I am not currently using it for any other source). I am still learning what all it can do, but have watched movies, listened to music and downloaded games thus far, and am very pleased with the results. It is easy to use and was already set up with my Amazon account when I received it; just needed to connect it to our Wi-Fi. I recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steve C."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love the Amazon Fire Stick. It was easy to set up. In a matter of minutes I had tons of movies and TV shows to choose from. The only problem is that it cuts out sometimes due to a bad connection to the internet. That may be because of my Wi-Fi, I'll have to get a stronger connection. But I'm always able to get it working and finish watching my programs. I already started watching The Walking Dead and I have tons of other shows on my Watch list as soon as I'm done watching this. I highly recommend this product to people who enjoy television. There are so many TV shows coming out  that are exclusive to Netflix or Amazon so it's important to have this so we don't miss out on great television.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Craig"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Had problems with the chrome cast cause it cuts off portions of video on my tv, the firestick allows me to adjust the screen so I never miss the bottom half. That itself was worth the $40 it cost.

I wish that had been made more clear prior to purchasing.  I had just bought my tablet this winter so I never thought it wouldn't have that ability.

The voice option is also great.  No streaming issues at all.  High Def and the games are a very cool options for the kids as well.  This is a great upgrade rather than spending the extra money for the \"limited\" smart tv options.  For just $40 you get way more than a smart tv and save hundreds.  The only thing you will need to know is the fire stick does have to be plugged in to an outlet work.  I thought originally it was powered by the TV but it does need to be plugged in an outlet for power.  So you will need to make sure you have an extra outlet nearby.  Other than that this thing is great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adam M."}]
