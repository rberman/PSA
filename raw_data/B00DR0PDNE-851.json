With that said I am pleasantly surprised at how much I am enjoying this device. Once you do the initial setup, all someone must do is be connected to wifi on whatever device they choose. In our home, just about everyone carries around a cell phone with them where ever they are, which makes this even better. For the kids who don't have cell phones, they have the tablet which works equally as well.One area of concern. Chromecast only works on 2.4 GHz WiFi radio. There is an increasing demand for 5 GHz network in today's times simply for the significantly faster speeds it provides under the right conditions.

For anyone that doesn't understand what this means, basically 2.4 GHz is your standard WiFi radio, which just about everything that has ever been WiFi capable is compatible with. Over time with the amount of devices using WiFi, it has caused that particular frequency to become extremely crowded, and every device that uses WiFi is basically fighting each other for those  little invisible air waves.
