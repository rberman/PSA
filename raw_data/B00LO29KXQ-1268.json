[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "The Amazon Fire Stick constantly buffers, making it nearly worthless. Very, very frustrating to say the least.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Nathan L Shumate"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "While this device definitely has the technical horsepower advantage over the Roku stick, there is much room for improvement.Pros (Where my Fire Stick wins):-Very snappy, you can tell the Fire Stick has better tech specs than the Roku Stick.-Comes with an HDMI extension.-More games on Fire Stick.Cons (where my Roku wins):-For one thing the home interface is terrible. It is very cumbersome and just not pretty at all.-Search will only search Amazon Prime content, not Netflix, Starz, Plex, etc.-Apps are listed in a long line, so if you want to go to an app you haven't used in a while you have to scroll through every one.-The same apps are listed in different categories... It doesn't sound bad but it's annoying to me.-Lots of apps listed on the front page that aren't really useful for the Fire stick (VLC, File browsers, etc)-Movies and TV tabs only list Prime content-Apps that I don't own are listed in my front page, there is no \"store\". Undownloaded apps riddle and clutter the home screen.-I GET AN EMAIL EVERY TIME I DOWNLOAD AN APP!!!!!Push:-Streaming quality is great on both.-Remotes are basically the same.-Similar streaming apps, the Fire page lists that the Roku doesn't have an official Twitch app... But Roku does in fact have an official one now.In conclusion, these two devices do basically the same thing. However I MUCH prefer my Roku to the Fire TV. When I search for a show from my Roku home screen it lists all of my subscriptions that I can watch it on. It seems like Amazon is pushing prime way to hard on this device instead of offering an all-in-one streaming device that gets you to the right app for the show/movie you are looking for. It looses one star because of this.It looses the second star because the interface is just plain ugly. Fix this and you gain at least one star back. Maybe fixing this will help with my first complaint... Not to mention cut my cons list by at least half.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jared"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "From my Wii U, to my BluRay, to my native TV apps, there are no shortage of options to stream stuff in my house. This wins by far because of the interface and simple remote.

I has all the apps i could want and more, I have yet to try any of the games but i'm sure they would be good.

Perfect!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "tippy"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The fire TV stick was easy to setup and it does work but that is about it. Like most of the Fire line (fire, phone, fire TV, fire tablet) the content is extremely limited on the app market side. You have the traditional apps Hulu, Netflix, HBO, Crackle, Starz, Showtime, Sling television but the app market is missing apps like Encore, FX Now, USA Now, Fox Now, AMC. I feel like the device never had the consumer in mind. The product feels like one big advertisement for their Amazon Instant Video. The Fire TV could be huge line of products but Amazon has not put real effort into building complete products and made available content to support their products. I would not pay full price for any fire product line until Amazon steps up their app market quality.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jeff"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Good Variety of items to watch but not as much as I had anticipated", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.
