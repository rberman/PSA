It works great. Plex is now fully supported and it's awesome because I can now stream my whole library of videos and audio to my TV.

The dongle comes with everything you need to get up & running within 5 minutes.  The quaiity of the build, packaging (included accessories) and functionality far eceeded my expectations.  It could come with better instructions but if you get perplexed, google for directons - there's a ton of information on the web about this product and its use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "El Toro \"Toro\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This product works about 85% of the time. It will sometimes be available to cast and other times the cast button will not show up on any of my devices.. This could of course be due to my router, so don't think it's an overall quality issue. It's built nicely, comes in a nice looking box that is equipped with a usb charger and a cable as well. Even though it doesn't work sometimes, it really is convenient for playing YouTube or Netflix videos on the fly. On a side note, you can play a video from YouTube on your phone and you don't have to keep the YouTube application open for it to keep playing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Vince"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought one for each of my Son-in-laws.

We have a bunch of iOS devices and whenever we wanted to find something to watch in the past it was a little tedious using the TV remote and menu, not very intuitive.  With the Chromecast you can look for your Netflix or Youtube content in the app and tap the Chromecast tv icon in the app.  The Chromecast then queries the appropriate source and displays it.I ended up buying a second one so we would have Chromecast capable tvs in the bedroom and the living room.  I also bought one for my parents and brother.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "B. Barnes"}]
