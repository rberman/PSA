I believe it will but it is \"recommended\" you connect it to power and mine wouldn't work until I did. I only bring this up because it is one more wire to deal with with a wall mounted television setup. Also the AC block is a little wider than the average plug so it doesn't easily fit alongside the other plugs plugged into the surge protectorAlso disappointed that the voice remote app is still not available for iPhone. Waiting patiently for that, because I don't like having to arrow through letters to type in movies I'm searching for etc.Great that it already comes registered to me and linked to my prime account so no need to setup that up.I ordered this as a prime member during the $19 special and it was well worth the money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Frostsdad"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It works well enough. I'm sure they'll work out the little bugs, like when watching streaming video when you pause the sound at that instant stays playing on a very fast loop -- pause should also mute but it doesn't do that.  Wish it had more configuration options and more things you can tweak in the options/preferences, such as streaming from local content on my streaming server.
