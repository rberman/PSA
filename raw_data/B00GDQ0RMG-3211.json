I brought it under the assumption(fault on my part) that I could get the TWC TV app on this. Not only can't I its not even compatible with the FireTV. So unfortunately I will be returning it because for me that is a deal breaker. I have Roku Streamers in all rooms because I don't pay the fees for the Set Top boxes. Less money out of pocket for me. I will be returning it and getting Roku Streaming sticks instead, sorry Amazon I tried it just didn't meet MY expectations.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

This is one of the worst purchases I've made.  I can't watch anything without it buffering every 30 seconds.  The xbox was fine with the same amazon prime membership on the same network.  Also, the 'feature' that duplicates your phone/tablet screen on the tv does not work either; it is lags then disconnects constantly to the point of unusable.Do not buy this if you are a samsung android user or have anything but the absolute best bandwidth on your internet connection (though that may be bad too).  Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.  Total disappointment.... and it just exited out of a program for no reason with 4 minutes remaining.Update, I can stream HD to my laptop and tablet in the same room as the stick at the same time with no problem... this thing is terrible.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Zachary D.
