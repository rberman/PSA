[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "Had great expectations for this.  Plugged it in, connected to my network about 20 feet from the router.  So far so good.  Tried to play a movie and repeatedly got the message no network detected.  That message would spontaneously go away and the selections would reappear.  I tried with a few movies and the same thing happened every time.  So I tried tv shows, same thing.  Finally one movie started and 4 seconds in I got a message saying I had low bandwidth, then a spinning circle, then nothing, then the no network message again.  I have been a prime member for years and this is the worst product I have ever received from Amazon.  Fortunately, they let me return it and gave me a complete refund or this would have been a one star review.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "thorsrotts"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV STick is awesome.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carol"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "OK, I think this FireStick was advertised with false & misleading information.  The multiple commercials which advertise this product do not show that it requires a 110v plug in to work.  The commercials show someone plugging it into their TV without the cord.  The commercial never shows the 110v plug required to operate this device.  This is simply misleading and implies that it's wireless, which is not the case.  This is just like Roku or other similar products available.On The Good Side:  it is small and easy to use/install.Felt ripped off when I opened the box and saw the plug.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven L Fischer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I won't lie. I love the Fire TV Stick.....except for one thing. I cannot figure out how to add my VUDU movies to it. I have some movies there because I could not get Prime on my BluRay player. Now, I have to use my BluRay player to watch my movies even with the prime. The remote and interface for the Fire Stick is much nicer than the one for my BluRay player, so I wish I could access my VUDU movies. I am impressed with being able to use my phone as a remote, and feel like it is fairly easy to quickly find shows I want. I love having prime, Netflix and Hulu all easily accessible. If Amazon adds VUDU to the capabilities of the Fire Stick, I will add another star!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "stringbean17"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jennifer Urban"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It completely freezes up about every 36-48 hours and has to be restarted. Since it has no power switch, and is located on the back of the TV which is inaccessible, I had to run a power strip to the front of my TV with the the Fire Stick plugged into it so I could use the switch on the power strip to restart it. My old Roku box had similar problems but it froze up far less often. The user interface is very Amazon centric, but I guess that is to be expected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JOHN HARTLEY"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "You have to use the plug, it's not really optional as indicated.

The remote is tiny, so this is alot easier to lose. When I first got the Fire TV Stick the app wasnt available yet for my iPhone, it is now. With your phone you can do the voice commands, but when your in Netflix it wont search within Netflix it will take you out of Netflix and search on Amazon instead.I honestly like the Chromecast better, which I own as well, the reason I purchased this was because I could access things on Amazon Prime which I couldn't do with the Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "nobull433"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Most of the time it works just fine but since this device uses wi-fi it tends to run a little slow sometimes. Therefore,I would suggest using it for the bedroom television or the kids room. To speed things up a bit I would suggest getting the full FIRE TV with the direct ETHERNET WIRE for your primary television.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paula Evjen \"Daniel Evjen\""}]
