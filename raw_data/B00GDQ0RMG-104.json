If I had a glitch initially, it was in figuring out my own TV menu. Other than that, it seemed to pick up our wireless pretty efficiently. Now, all we have to do is actually watch something with it.....................Pretty cool. I guess if I had one complaint, it will be that I ordered the \"voice activated\" remote for extra money and I think that's a little chintzy because now I have the remote that came with it AND the voice one. Will they take back the original remote and issue me a refund for it? I think not. So, now I have a useless remote sitting around. They should have just given you the option at the time of ordering to order the remote with or without the feature and charged a $5 upcharge for the feature.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David Loring"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Don't like it at all, the streaming services through my Sony Blue Ray player are much faster", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Clayton hall"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gino E Brown Jr"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A++++++++", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Frank D Banno"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it !!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Najib Mailatyar"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I'll put 5 star when i can set spanish menu.The rest is really good!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jotohue"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to set up.
