An hour later after a lot of please hold he tells me that the fire tv doesn't support user agreement pages.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install and set up.

This is the best investment I've made so far this year (2015). I. Was so impressed with it I ordered a second one for the big screen in the basement.  This little stick out performs my wireless Blu ray player that cost 4 times what I paid for the Fire Stick. I was actually so impressed with its performance that I downloaded the Sling tv app, so between that Netflix and my Amazon Prime instant videos I cut the cord to the very expensive satellite tv. With the available apps such as PBS and Smithsonian channel (which is free tv) and my over air antenna this $40.00 investment is saving me over $1200 a year in tv programming.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to \"cut the cord\" to expensive cable and satellite bills. It definitely been worth it to me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Blackberry mom"}]
