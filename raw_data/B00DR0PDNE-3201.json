My TV did not power it up directly so I needed to use the power adapter that came with the item. Once you log into their site, it will immediately identify the dongle and link to it.

Easy to setup and use - when everything works exactly as intended.2. The direct play mode for Youtube has excellent picture quality.The Bad:1. Totally unusable performance when streaming from your PC's video player (the primary reason I purchased it) - picture freezes, stutters, out of sync, etc.2. No support or documentation - clearly #1 is a common issue - found many people complaining about it - but Google provides just about zero support. This appears to be the case for all issues with this device - if you have to go under the hood for any reason, Google provides no useful support.In Sum:I would not recommend this device - it fails to perform as promised.  There are less simple - but much more reliable - methods for streaming or directly playing video from your PC to your TV screen.  However, if you only want to stream from some service that is not on Roku and is one of the services that Google has setup for direct download with Chromcast (like Youtube), then this might be a solution for you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "VoxVulgus"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've owned 3 generations of Roku players and the latest generation of AppleTV, and I can say now that Chromecast has Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Pandora, and HBO GO... this is the best media streaming solution (other than some custom-built open source system).
