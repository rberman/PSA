I had some issues with the Chromecast and it became unreliable. When I saw I could grab this for $20, I knew it was at least worth it to take a shot. It has exceeded my expectations. For right now I use it for Netflix and Amazon Prime's movies, shows and music. The interface is easy to use and the remote works great. Setup was quick and easy and it hasn't had an issue in over 2 months of use. Casting from my phone as come in handy on occasion too. I might just grab another one for the other TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tom"}]
