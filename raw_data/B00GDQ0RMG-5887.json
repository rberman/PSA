I already have a couple of Rokus, a couple of smart Blu Ray players, and a chromecast, so when I saw this deal, I almost passed it up, but then sense prevailed and clicked on the order button. Was a little disappointed when the local Best Buy had it in stock and mine still wasn't shipped, but decided to wait it out and it finally got there (to be fair, it got there a week before the promised date, so I shouldn't really complain).Once I plugged it in, configured the Wifi connection, all seemed to go well until it went to download the latest software. Unfortunately no matter what I tried, it kept failing to download. I gave up initially, had some dinner and a couple of hours later took it down to my basement and hooked it up to the projector to try again (thats where I wanted to put it in the first place anyway - but was trying on my TV upstairs which is a few feet away from the Wifi router). However, this time everything went smoothly - the download took some time but succeeded and I got the intro video. Did some research and downloaded some apps, games, sideloaded XBMC, and everything works more smoothly than I imagined. I did use the power supply that came with it, and also the HDMI extender that came with it. Not sure if makes a difference, but I have been enjoying the content for the last week - no stutters on Amazon prime content - built in movies, TV shows, Amazon music, Photos - everything was already pre-configured to my Prime account.I think its an awesome deal and a much better deal than the Chromecast which is more of a novelty compared to the stick. I think the wait was worth it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amdroid007"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy to setup.  Only using it for a couple of days.

It kept saying my internet was too slow. After it finally was updated I was very impressed. I love the way you can scroll and find your items purchased verses prime items, and how you can easily access both Netflix and You Tube. I purchased both the Google Chrome and the Amazon Fire Stick. I like that play offers easy access through my cell phone, laptop, and Ipod. I haven't tried to set my Fire Stick up through those means yet but it didn't seem as easy. Also the connecting and putting in a password to link YouTube to Fire Stick was a little cumbersome compared to the plug and play versatility of the Google Chrome. I am happy with the Fire TV Stick though. It's menu helps one navigate easier than the Google Chrome one and I don't have Amazon access through the Google Chrome (which I am assuming is intentional on Amazon's part).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kdwhite39 \"ed lx prof\""}]
