Items were well packaged and in good order as I have come to expect from Amazon. Extremely easy to setup, just plug into HDMI socket and use either USB slot or provided plug to power the device. Software setup is via website or through chromecast app and its all rather easy (took about 5mins). Its definitely a more enjoyable way to watch YouTube listen to music on TV. For $35  its a great little device but several months since announce Google has done little too expand its capabilities (or at least I haven't seen improvements).So much potential but something needs to be done by powers that be to realise it.
