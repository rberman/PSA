I thought wireless would not work as well as being connected directly to the computer, but not in this case.  So far it is working just as well as my Roku did, and that was hooked up directly from the tv to the computer.  It takes awhile to get used to the remote because there are no arrows for up, down, etc.  The center \"button\" is the \"okay\" and the rim around it is what you use to arrow.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "L.

The menu is EXTREMELY misleading if you want to watch Netflix...even if you've been watching something on Netflix during a prior viewing you end up on amazon prime instead. I can't count the number of mis-starts where we had to go back and load Netflix first. Also fairly frequent interruptions in streaming despite a new state of the art router.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "spankylover"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Giving it only 3 stars because I had to call in for help because it would loose wifi over and over. Called support and they helped me fix it. Turns out these pick up alot of interference from the TV which makes it drop wifi. Wierd for a device made to plug directly into your TV's HDMI slot. I ended up using a tube from empty roll of paper towels along with the the 4inch extension it comes with to move it away from the TV some. Now it works just dont look behind my TV lol.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
