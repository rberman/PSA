He installed it easily and we had it set up in no time. I love it! Simple to use and lots of choices from TV shows, good movie selections and children's shows for my grandson. There is much more that I still need to explore! Its a good bargain that offers a variety of entertainment in the convenience of your own home!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amy Athey"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great right out of the box, but it is a little hard to get to the search screen.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sally Dix"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's good I just use it for netflix", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aracely garcia"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I like this much better than my Roku or the apps on my Bluray player.
