It is so easy to us and you can easily move it from tv to tv without a bunch of cords which I like. I have found a ton of good apps and it even offers an app that is basically like having satellite television and you can pay for HBO etc if you want more channels. 20$ a month for basically all the channels I watch anyway is a deal and a half!
