The directional navigation was making me crazy with not responding with single press and moving alllllll they way to left or right with double press. If you are fine with controlling it with your phone which most of people will, then it is fine.- It will not allow registering of multiple user account. I bought these with my girl friend's account who has prime, and I happen to have all the paid apps on my amazon account which is without prime (Plex mainly, which is absolutely awesome). It seems that we will have to either give up on all Prime video contents or re-buy all the paid apps. Again, this won't be a problem if you have all of these on a single account.For $20 I would say it is worth it. It does everything chromecast does plus you can take advantage of your Prime video. And bonus remote which doesn't really function well. However, if you already have chromecast, dont have amazon prime, or have any complications I state above, it is not worth it. I am returning mine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jenny seo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Fire TV stick.  Setup was super easy.  The setup video was nice but almost uneeded since it is so easy to use.  There are really nice parental control settings, which I use primarily to control purchasing on my account.  The choice of entertainment is wonderful.  Picture quality is great.  The remote is very responsive.  This is a wonderful all around streamer.  The fact that my Amazon Cloud Drive photos, Prime Music, and Prime Instant Video were all instantly accessible when I recieved it, makes it even better.  If you are part of the Amazon Eco-System, this is a must have item. I don't often totally love a product, but I love this one.

I have Prime, a Fire TV, and now this Fire Stick.  The only thing I would want out of the Fire Stick is the Fire TV Remote.  Also, I wish the picture would show that you have to have it plugged in into the outlet.  I really wasn't aware of that once I ordered and had to do some re-wiring to get it powered on.The great thing about it is that the remote works without pointing at the device.  This is also my first stick device, so I might just be na\u00efve, but it was something I truly appreciated, since my HDMI is on the back of the TV.We use it solely for the kids to watch their shows (TumbleLeaf, Paw Patrol, UmiZoomi).  If you can get it for the special price, you can't really beat this thing.Also, I've read that you can get XBMC on this.  I haven't done that since I have an AppleTV2, but in terms of speed, this thing blows my ATV2 out of the water.  Just the fact that it can have XBMC on it makes me feel that it's a better value than Chromecast and any other stick device.  I guess the only rival I can think of is RaspPi, but I like having a remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "P.

Unfortunately, neither of the Samsung HDTVs in my house nor the Sony HDTV apparently have a powered HDMI port, making external power to the stick necessary.That's where the trouble starts. Apparently the output of the USB ports on any of my TVs also doesn't supply enough power to run this device. You get a warning screen that has the option \"start anyway\", but that clearly says that there is not enough power for normal operation.So now the problem becomes supplying power to the stick. But the supplied USB cable is so short that you cannot do this without an ugly and clumsy extension cord. And that is where the whole concept just falls apart.It just seems to be a much better idea to have a regular HDMI cable running to a hidden box in a cabinet (as in an Apple TV or a Roku or the Fire box) that is powered along with all your other devices. The stick concept is useless unless you have a TV set that supplies the power directly to the HDMI port.Makes me wonder of course what brands / models of TV actually provide enough power to run the Fire TV Stick directly", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Michael Franz"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Piece of CRUD.

Again, I haven't had any of these problems with other HDCP devices.*I temporarily tried using the Amazon power supply to power the HDMI switch, which solved the HDCP pass through issue, but that resulted in major network connectivity issues with the Fire Stick.
