Works beautifully with Popcorn Time IO internet streaming and VideoStream Chrome browser app for local streaming over 2.4GHz 802.11n (802.11g is insufficient and will cause buffering).

Thinking about using that combo with 8\" or so display with HDMI input as an inexpensive in-car system to mirror my phone to for navigation, music, movies, etc. for on the road.Only way to make it better is if it has 5GHz 802.11ac support.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GoTheDistance"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "One of the best investments I ever made...use it every single day!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul Thornton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product, easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrea Perry"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's nice", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kamleshvora"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good google", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Maykol"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Sometimes ir has problems reading certain kind of video files.
