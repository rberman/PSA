Then when the Kindle Fire HDX came out, I 'upgraded' to it, assuming the connector would work as well.  Well, it wasn't compatible at all.  What was recommended was called \"Push TV\" from Netgear.  I bought it and struggled to get it to connect, but then once I 'mirrored' the image from my Fire  HDX, there was always a bit of distorted shadow on the background of the TV image.  I EVEN upgraded my router, thinking that would clear up the image.  But it never really was clear so I just tolerated the shadowy image.  Recently, while chatting with a technical representative via the 'Mayday' button on the Fire HDX,  I asked for help with the Push TV and the rep mentioned that she has the Amazon Fire TV Stick and that it works surprisingly well.  So I researched it and thought about it and went ahead and bought it.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!  Best thing ever!  It works and was very easy to set-up. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.  Good job Amazon!!!  Of course, now I don't know what to do with the Push TV unit ...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Peggy T. \"Pegs Quest\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works as advertised, a great addition to your home", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Ted S."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "There is no search bar, I also get kicked off at times", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "seymoune"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is awesome!
