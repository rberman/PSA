I need not have feared. Thank you Amazon, it was easy. During a visit with our 16 year old grandson, I hooked it up; registered my WiFi password; Peter zoomed through the movies (showing me how easy it is); and we watched Steve Martin! My only problem was my Comcast WiFi signal kept going weak; stopping the movie for a couple minutes each time. Annoying but we managed to laugh and get snacks during the interruptions. I will have to deal with Comcast over this issue but as far as the Fire TV Stick, we are sure to watch a lot of movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Carol"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works good, Must have good wifi!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer \"gmilbrat\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Fire stick works good for a few minutes the cuts off and resets.
