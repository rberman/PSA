I have a PC plugged into my TV to act as a streaming device and media server.  I haven't even booted it up in 3 months.  There's no need to even turn it on anymore.  I can cast whatever I want from my tablet or phone.  It's great.  I already have my phone booted and by my side.  Launch netflix and in seconds I'm casting to my tv.  Wanna watch a movie off my network drive?  Done.All this for a fraction of the price of a less usable Roku or Apple TV?Sweet.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J. S.
