[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I bought this hoping it would replace my Apple TV because I don't like Apple.  It doesn't.  This lags and there are virtually no apps available for it.  It's good to use with your Amazon account, but not with any 3rd party apps.  It won't even let me download FOX or ABC apps!  I would've bought the regular Fire TV box if I'd have known how laggy this stick is!  I wish I could trade it in and just buy the regular one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeri L.

Wasn't going to buy one, but after wandering around Best Buy and seeing them in different parts of the store I decided it was the universe telling me I needed one 8-). Primary reason for getting one is that AppleTV is good (we've got 2 already), but obviously they can't access Prime Video.I found the remote very easy to use (especially if you have used an Apple TV remote) and the app selection is excellent.If you have Amazon Prime, get one of these - it really does deliver everything you need.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nigel H"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very good product.
