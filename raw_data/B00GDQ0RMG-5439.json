It guides you through the installation process.  Within minutes I was logged into my other accounts and was even able to fling YouTube from my IOS device simply by pairing my phone and typing in a passcode provided. I have an Apple TV downstairs and the Fire TV Stick loads and navigates faster and I haven't had any buffering pauses while watching a movie.  I am very happy with it so far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Randy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I just love it. Much more than I ever expected.

I purchased the Fire Stick on special for $19 and would be very upset had I paid full price for the device.This is the third streaming device I have connected to my TV, and it is the only one with connectivity issues.  The Fire Stick loses connection every couple of minutes.  I have two wifi networks in my home, and I have the same issue on both networks.  Meanwhile my other streaming device never drop connection.The other issue I have with the Fire Stick is the menu.  The menu is not as convenient and user friendly as its competitors' menus.  It took awhile to find the videos I own versus the videos on Prime and the videos you have to pay to video.There is much room for improvement and would wait for Amazon to develop their streaming devices a bit more before investing in one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dean"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "If you have Direct Tv its pretty much worthless for any tv apps.
