You can not sign-in to hotel wifi because you can not access a web browser which is required to log-in to hotel wifi before connecting the Fire TV Stick.Also, I subscribe to HBO and Showtime on my Comcast/Xfinity cable, but it's not available on the Fire TV Stick.This is something that should be mentioned in the product description, as this would have been a deal-breaker for me.This product is basically worthless to me.Though I am a big fan and faithful customer of Amazon's for the past 10 years .... they dropped the ball ... big time ... with this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Ed Lohrer e3_prog \"progressive music fan\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am enjoying my fire stick.
