I mainly use this for plex (cost $5.00 to activate on fire stick) which has not lagged or skipped at all so far.  I stream mkv, MP4 and avi videos of different sizes, some up to 12GB in size, with no issues.  I like the interface of the fire stick, but it can be more organized.Netflix, pandora and Amazon prime videos/music work fine so far also.  The games are a nice plus, as they are a good time killer.  If the fire stick continues to work good, I will be getting another.Also noteworthy, I have the fire stick plugged into a soundbar, not directly into the TV.  Setup was a breeze,  took about 7 minutes.  Definetly recommend this so far", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "andrew \"\\\\andrew\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love that when you buy an Amazon device your account is already preinstalled and ready to go!,", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Leilajake"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "nice product.
