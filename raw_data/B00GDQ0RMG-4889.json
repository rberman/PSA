I had some difficulty getting it to connect to my 5ghz band wifi stream, but with a little work and manipulation of that particular band, it was able to connect. Video and audio quality is great, though there are some slight stutters in the playback from time to time.

Netflix and Hulu are always locking the device so that I have to unplug and reset it. The screen flickers and sound pops when it changes from SD to HD quality. My remote is  possessed, sometimes after clicking the navigation ring it will just auto scroll in the direction pressed requiring another hard reset.Where is VUDU, and Disney Movies Anywhere?? Or at least let me link  my content to my Amazon account.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "GreyGhost"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very Cool!  My kids love the video games.  I love the interface.  Amazon hit a home run with this one.  I can now watch Espn and Disney channel (need someone with a participating cable provider to activate).  Netflix and Amazon interface is the best I have used so far.Only downloaded a couple games but 4,5,8, 16 and Dad all love playing and taking turns.Be sure to go into settings and activate parental controls to prevent in app purchases.
