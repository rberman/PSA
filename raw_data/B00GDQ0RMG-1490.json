[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product.  It's simple, cheap and provides me with everything I need for my secondary (non-smart) TV in my bedroom.  The easy to use remote works great and doesn't require me to point it directly at my TV in order for it to work.  I am able to view Amazon Prime, Netflix, ESPN and videos stored on my local network storage (via a free app).  Does everything I need and I have no problems with lag/performance switching apps or with streaming video (local or from the internet).  Couldn't be happier!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "W.
