[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I'm an Amazon Prime member and used to connect my laptop to my TV with an HDMI cable to watch Amazon Instant Videos. Worked fine except having to move my laptop and the HDMI every time was kind of a pain. With this Fire Stick, I just inserted theHDMI Stick and connected the power cable from the Stick to the Outlet. Then just find the HDMI source on your TV and it asks for you Wireless password and connects. Then just go to the menu an choose Amazon and all my saved movies in my watchlist are there. It also has Netflix, Hulu etc if you have subscription to them. I love not having to connect my laptop anymore.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ritch Vernon"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Fine for streaming from Amazon, Netflix and Hulu but truthfully it isn't really much use beyond that as there is (at least presently) a very limited selection of useful apps.If what you want it for is within the scope of Amazon's prime media services, or Netflix/Hulu then I think it's a reasonable buy.The usefulness of any device like this is really going to be defined by the software (apps) that are available for it unfortunately.  For me, this was/is a $20 buy.  Had I paid $40 I would have returned it...it's really not worth that price for what it can do right now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mr Legume \"63271864410\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "So far, the actual device is great, in that it does what it says it does. It seems faster than my Roku and Chromecast, which isn't saying much. I am docking 2 stars because of the absolute ridiculousness that is the remote. The actual remote I guess is fine but the fact that it took me 20 mins to open the damn thing is terrible. The battery cover is on so tight I had to actually cut notches in the bottom to give traction to slide it open. Let me say that again, I HAD TO CUT MY BRAND NEW REMOTE BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT OPEN. Hey Amazon, put some finger grips on the damn thing so your customers can slide it open, or don't make it so tight. Sliding, prying, nothing worked. I actually broke a piece of metal that I used to open it at first once my finger nails didn't work. I guess 20 mins of working it fatigued the plastic. I have used hundreds of remotes and other electronics and never had this kind of difficulty before. I even downloaded the remote app but you can't connect to the device until you have selected the correct wifi network, so you are screwed unless the physical remote works.I have't played with the device long enough to say if it is all that much better than the other options out there other than it is faster than the Roku, which is my chief complaint of that device. I don't need 3,000 apps/channels. I just need it to select the 5 or 10 I use faster. If it wasn't for the remote, it would have been a much better experience. Here's to the batteries lasting long enough that I don't have to deal with the remote any time soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "James Booker"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Total Failure Right Out of the Box (boxes, we got two of these turkeys) ...

Really like the music option of the digital music showing up that I've purchased, and the song lyrics playing was a cool feature too.Fire TV Stick wasn't fitting real easy into either TV's HDMI ports, felt like I was going to break it trying to push the stick in to the port. Not sure what's up with that because it was a problem on both TV's.So far both Fire Sticks have worked with no issues to report, but I've only had them for a few days.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "theshawn"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I agree with the other reviewers that have had connection problems.  My tv is just a few feet from the wifi access point. The fire tv stick has a strong signal when it connects (seems to prefer the 5 ghz band), but so far I have had a couple of random drops that require a power cycle reset.  Otherwise, it will just sit there acting like its buffering the stream forever.  When I reset it, it wants to restart the wifi setup (enter password), but then mysteriously remembers the password and goes to the home menu.  When it's working, the streaming works well.  So four complaints:1. Drops connection sporadically requiring power cycle to reset.2. Remote key presses are sometimes misinterpreted as multiple key presses or button hold down behavior making navigation erratic.3. Music playing in the background doesn't always stop/pause when another app is running.  For example, I paused a stream in the shotime app and the amazon prime music started blasting away through the tv speakers.  This happens even when I think the music has been paused.4. Shotime app doesn't load the thumbnails for the different shows and you need the thumbnails to access the content.  Once you have guessed at the correct selection, the streaming works fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R. Brown"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very slick and easy to set up. So far I like everything about it except I wish I could access my media on my LAN with it. Recommended for those who watch and listen to everything via the Internet. I have yet to figure out how to get to my personal photos and videos without putting them in the cloud first.I prefer this interface to the Chromecast, I think a traditional remote interface is better than having to use a phone or tablet.

After a few months of using this thing, I've decided to downgrade the rating to 2 stars because of 2 main issues. First:Video quality is not always great. I have very fast internet at home so this is definitely on Amazon's side. I think even their \"HD\" content is heavily compressed and possibly an interpolated frame rate as well. Some things look perfect, others wonky.Sound out of sync and/or crackling: This happens OFTEN, sometimes by as much as 1 or 2 seconds where the audio is either ahead of or lagging behind the picture. Sometimes pausing and restarting works, other times I have to shut the whole thing off and restart. This happens on average once per day. Other times there will be a lot of weird static noises. So far pausing/unpausing fixes it. Regardless, none of the other streaming devices I've used have this issue so it's kind of annoying.Amazon has a serious issue with not understanding how to design products for consumers.Amazon, we need to talk. Have you ever actually used an entertainment system? Do you understand how power strips work? Did you deliberately design your plug to be as small and inconvenient at the same time as possible? You can actually plug this in and take up three outlets in a typical powerstrip. I have 1 empty spot. Did you think that this strategy might force people to get rid of competing products? Have you ever seen the plug Apple uses? Notice how it tucks right in, taking up exactly the space it deserves and no more? LIKE MAGIC!Anyhow, the plug is awful. They also have a big warning about not using any other cables or plugs. After this unreasonably angry rant I plan on googling some specs to see if the apple plugs will work (it's just a plug with a USB port, so I assume it's fine). If not, I might return this.Let's get positive for a second: It works well! I briefly owned the other amazon TV roku copy, which had poor and shifting video quality and just a lot of wonkiness that seemed bad even in beta. When I got the offer to buy this for $20, I figured even if it is nothing more than a amazon prime/netflix/hulu player, that would be just fine.It had trouble setting itself up. I had to unplug it and start over twice (this was what the dongle suggested doing). I have fast internet that otherwise had no problems that night, but maybe Amazon was overloaded. Once updated, it puts you through an infuriatingly stupid cartoon with exceptionally patronizing instructions that you cannot skip. If I ever meet anyone involved in making this video I will punch them in the face (I'm not even kidding). Oh wait, be positive. The set up includes a handy moment where you can hit mute and go pee. Both me and my dog needed to pee so this worked out well. Adding insult to this cartoonish injury, the system is fairly well designed and intuitive. I had planned on using online help/the user manual if I got stuck, but I never needed to. If you are illiterate or possibly a dog, you might appreciate the video though.The video quality was a-ok! The system turned on quickly.One quirk: while watching an offering from Prime TV the audio and video got out of sync. Pausing and unpausing fixed it on the first try.I have a Sharp Smart TV. The TV's remote works with the Fire TV (both of them), which is great. I assume that means most universal remotes would also work.I haven't yet got the audio for my entertainment system back to full power (my new TV and old receiver are not compatible) so I can't comment on the audio performance. Unlike the fire box, this does not have an audio out other than the HDMI port. I really only care about having solid stereo audio (no surround sound or the like) so I don't think I'll care much about any possible limitations there, but something to consider.I was hoping I'd be able to mirror my ipad and occasionally laptop screen and right now it seems that is not possible, which is a disappointment. But, I would imagine this is something that can be fixed soon.Overall, so long as the plug issue can be resolved and get some sort of assurance or solution for mirroring a real tablet I will likely keep it, especially for $20. After the holidays we plan on canceling netflix so the convenience this thing will give us in accessing amazon prime alone makes it worth hanging onto. I don't think it's worth $40, but at the same time that's still not that much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "clevernonsense"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "No DLNA support, no Windows Media server functionallity.Turns a regular HDTV into a smart tv.
