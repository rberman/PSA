It kept searching for my remote and I had to unhook it a couple of times before it took.  My tv doesn't have a USB port, but the included cable worked with my HDMI port.  The remote is very nice, although difficult to open to get the batteries inside.  I had to search for a Youtube video to get directions for something that should have been easy.  It took a flathead screwdriver to pop it open.  I like being able to scan through the choices available and like that I can pick back up where I left off if I can't watch an entire show.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Heidi N."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's is great when it works but it loses connection in the middle of a movie.
