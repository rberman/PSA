[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "We have had the fire tv for several months and and we are increasing disappointed with it.  Apps such as sling, espn and hulu often run into errors where they will not stream at all or will stream audio with no video.  Sometimes the amazon fires comes on and will not connect to the internet over the wired network despite the internet working fine on other devices.  In all of these cases a reboot or two fixes the problem, but i get tired of rebooting it half the time i want to use it.  We use all of the same apps on a Roku in another room with no issue.  I wish i had bought a second roku!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Douglas D.
