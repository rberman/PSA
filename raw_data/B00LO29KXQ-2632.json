I had it set up in less than 15 minutes and I think this included watching the tutorial.  Kids are already watching a movie.  I will probably buy another one to go on the other TV since it is a pain to go through the Wii.

I was really anticipating D day, was actually excited. Then it comes, I use it to watch shows on Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Instant Video... ect, and what I'm watching freezes up more than a dusty VCR tape. I know my internet speed isn't the problem because it clocks at an average of 80 MBPS and none of my other devices have this issue (not even the Chrome Cast I almost threw away).
