[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Compared to my Western Digital TV Live Hub 1-TB Media Center, the Fire TV:* Is more responsive* Has integrated WIFI* Has only 1 USB port. The Live Hub has 2, but if you connect a WIFI adapter, then they are equal* Has cloud storage for pictures. Live Hub has an internal 1Tb hard drive.Now to talk about the Fire TV itself:* Great packaging.* Small and sleek* with the USB port, I can connect my Logitech USB keyboard with built-in keypad.* Voice search is effective for most titles, but it's no surprise that foreign titles would be harder to find using voice search.Remote:Needs to be a tad bigger with keyboard on the back. At the very least, a Sleep button :-)Prime videos:* Some Prime videos (free) have low resolution, which is fine for playing on small screens.* You can log into Amazon from a web browser and search for free Prime videos to add to your watch list. This feels like it's more efficient than doing it within Fire TV. From Amazon.com, search for \"Included with Prime Instant Video\" and refine your search as needed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "K.
