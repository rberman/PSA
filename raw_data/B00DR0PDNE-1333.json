When I first started looking into a Chromecast vs some of the other products that could stream Netflix, Hulu, etc I wasn't sure if this was the right option compared to a stand alone item like an Roku.  But I am very happy with this product.  The price was the big selling point for me... with the Chromecast I was able to get an inexpensive product that allowed me to view my streaming services along with anything I can vie win Google Chrome.  Would definitely recommend", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ryan Sunley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Osama Osman"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great when it is used within close proximity to our wifi router.

For some reason it plays music at its own pace.  It starts out directly synchronized to your device but after a few songs it seems to be doing its own thing.  Cheaper alternative to Apple TV which I use almost exclusively.  Good for Android users I suppose", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jason Griggs"}]
