I currently own a Roku 2 box and this product. I purchased the Chromecast for simple YouTube viewing on my TV. It gets the job done.As a whole, this product is much more compatible with Android devices. You can stream most video outside of Chromecast approved apps on an Android device.If you're a heavy Mac user like me, you would be better off with an Apple TV.
