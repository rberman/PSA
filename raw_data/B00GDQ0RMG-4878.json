[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is a terrific product, but unfortunately my high speed internet connection wasn't consistently fast enough to stream movies without interruption. I had to return it for that reason, but if I have access in the future to a faster connection, I will re-order this item.

However, I am disappointed that it is not compatible for screen sharing with my Kindle Fire HD.  While reading about the product I was of the impression that I would be able to mirror my Kindle Fire HD's screen to the TV using the Fire TV Stick.  I have a Kindle running Fire OS 2.0 or greater, however it still somehow is not compatible.  I don't believe that was clear in the Fire TV Stick description.I am also disappointed that I asked for the product with the belief that it included a HBO GO app, however upon reading more realized that it will not be available until Spring 2015 (a specific date would be nice).  This is another major reason that I purchased the stick, as my smart TV does not include a HBO GO app either.  I'm sure it will be worth the wait once the app is released, but I'm still disappointed that I missed the fine print about having to wait.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ASP419"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Worked just like it showed on the TV commercials.
