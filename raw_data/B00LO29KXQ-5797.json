As easy as Apple TV which is also amazing and the remote is similar. I was so excited to have received this as quickly as I did and would love the opportunity to purchase more at this price. I needs to gift these for Christmas and the New Year. I can not part with mine. Suggestion is that we could have the ability to use out of the country. Then it would be perfect. Thank you for providing the Fire Stick and Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "substitute"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "very good product very fast works well would buy again amazon needs to run another deal on these for 19 bucks", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "nick"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I would love to be able to use this as my go-to streamer because the interface, apps, remote and video quality are all good. Unfortunately, the audio sync issue is not correctable with my TV or my receiver. Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime all have the issue. I know audio sync varies between devices and I've always been able to correct it either through my tv settings or my receiver a/v delay setting. It seems like the audio/video delay is already offset by several miliiseconds and any correction I try through normal means just makes it worse. This should most definitely be a software issue so hopefully it will get fixed. I will update and change my review if this ever does.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/5", "author": "Jason Higgs"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought the fire tv stick through my fiancee's prime account for the special $19 prime members price. Took about 5 min. to set up. At first it buffered a lot while watching Netflix but after calling Comcast and having them help me change some settings in my router it works flawlessly!!! I found it to be faster that the roku stick my brother owns. I love the selection of apps and games available. If you're a prime member this is a must to stream the amazon video content. Even if you're not its still a good streaming device.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "po2015"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I bought two of these and really like it.
