[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Feels very Amazon-centric, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your viewing habits.  For me, it feels limited and constrained because of that.  In addition to the Fire stick, I also have a Chromecast and Roku player and they all have their pros and cons.  What I like about the Fire stick is that it has better hardware, although I have noticed some issues in video playback recently, a remote, and I got it at the pre-order price.  Otherwise, I'd have been fine with my old Roku player (which this replaced but the Roku has a lot more options) and Chromecast, which I still use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ray"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My family and I enjoy this device, trust me you can't go wrong with the Firestick!

It is sadly unusable, as it has an incredibly slow refresh rate and skips several times a minute.

I was immediately impressed by its snappy performance.  I plugged it into his stereo receiver to utilize his surround sound and it works like a champ; If you plan on plugging it into a receiver like I did, make sure you can use the HDMI port furthest to the right, since the power plugs in on the right side of the stick, you need the right side of the stick to be open.  Alternatively, you can use the HDMI extender provided in the box.  It's easy to get the impression that it's going to be a nice product just by opening the box and viewing the layout of the contents.If you have WiFi, prime, and netflix, this device can make a non-smart TV feel like one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bruce"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "My Fire TV Stick constantly has to buffer and be restarted.
