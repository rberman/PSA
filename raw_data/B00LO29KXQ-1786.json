You have to dig for your apps because the primary focus is Amazon Prime content. Which, I get, but it just isn't the most user friendly approach. Also, if you want to push anything via airplay to the Stick, it seems as though you either have to have an android phone (because all the apps that will allow you to do that are for droid), or you have to buy another product that will allow mirroring. So, you're digging for content unless it's specifically Prime/Amazon, and you're limited in what it can physically do. If the mirroring issue could be fixed, that would be a major plus. Since Comcast/Xfinity isn't a recognized provider for practically ALL the tv channels, it would be nice to be able to pull them up on my iPhone and push them to the Fire Stick like I do with my Apple TV.Bottom line, for the money, it's fine. But if you've got 30 more dollars, you can get an Apple TV and push your Amazon content to it thru your phone and avoid the aggravation.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jennifer Jordan Jeffcoat"}]
