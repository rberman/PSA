[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I purchased this to use amazon instant video on my bedroom sony tv which does't have inter web capability. Was easy to connect to the tv and my wireless, and works great. I downloaded a 2 hr 10 min movie to watch and it downloaded in under 10 seconds. Granted, that probably has a lot to do with my wireless and cable connection speed, but just thought I'd put that out there.At the same time I purchased a samsung linkstick for my living room tv, (which has inter web compatibility), only to find out samsung doesn't support amazon instant video. Fortunately, roku can be easily and quickly transferred between multiple tv's! Yay Roku!I'm pleased with this purchase and think you will be too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Winsum"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This was a terrible purchase! I bought it because my Apple TV has a limited number of channels; however, the Roku crashes and/or reboots so often I typically never have a chance to use it and end up switching back to the Apple TV just so I can actually watch something. As an example, just trying to access Netflix will typically cause at least 4 crashes of the Roku, assuming you get it to work at all. The remote is slow to respond. Overall a big disappointment that I would not recommend to a friend or an enemy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R. D.

This stick worked great for 4 months and then it started constantly rebooting. It tried it on another tv just to make sure the problem was with to stick and not the tv and still have the same issue. This stick only has a 3 month warranty so I'm out of luck.

This week (almost exactly 6 months later) it died.  Looking through the other reviews now (there were very few at the time) I see that this is not an unusual event.  It is a shame, since it offered access to a wide range of channels, and reasonably good reception with very little lagging.  Setup was fairly easy.  The remote is wi-fi based and there were no pairing or interference problems.  So what happened?  The stick got VERY hot one evening, and that was that.  Having run through all the suggested remedies by customer support and online advice, it appears something burned out.  At 6 months, the 30 day return policy by Amazon, and 90 day warrantee from Roku are long gone.  But, $50 every 6 months seems like a lot to pay.
