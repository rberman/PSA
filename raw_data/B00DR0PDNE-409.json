I highly recommend the Fire TV Stick over this any day. This device basically works by streaming all content from a mobile device or a computer to the stick. In other words, if you want to watch netflix, you have to have the netflix app open on your phone or computer, and from there \"cast\" it to the stick. This seems totally pointless to me. With the Fire TV Stick you simply download the Netflix app on the stick and can use it whenever you please. The chromecast also doesn't have a dedicated remote. You have to use your phone. And let me clarify, streaming is ALL this device does. When you aren't streaming a video or music the the chromecast, there's nothing else to do. That's it. For around the same amount of money, definitely go for the Fire TV Stick. Aside from having more apps (including Amazon Instant), there is a youtube app which completely diminishes the need for a Chromecast. There's also the ability to sideload other apps such as Kodi (formerly XBMC) to turn your simple stick into a full blown Home Theater Media Center.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nicolette"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great Product very helpful.
