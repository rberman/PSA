[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "We bought this after having bought the Fire TV Stick.  Not sure we actually needed this full size edition but we do love it.

This is the second media streamer I've owned and this one is more stable that the Sony SMP-100 it replaced. Debated between this and Roku, but the natural tie-in between the Amazon Fire TV and my Prime music, watch list and library tipped the scales. Just wish I could get Acorn TV on this one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "kurt odenwald"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "One of the best gifts I've given my wife.

Great job by Amazon getting this right!  It comes pre-installed with your Prime settings -- simply unpack, plug it in, plug in the HDMI, turn it on and follow the on-screen prompts -- takes MAYBE 10 minutes.  Small, easy to use and nearly invisible, Amazon -- with Sling TV -- has just changed TV + streaming for the better!!  Say goodbye to bundled cable extortion!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jethro"}]
