[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I ordered 2 when they came out for $19 and I should of ordered more because we love it. We have the reg Fire TV as well and love it but I would have rather bought 4 of these and saved the money since they do the same thing except for the voice command which we don't even use as much anyway. We don't have cable so we just do Amazon Instant along w Netflix and we have an abundant shows to watch including the news on the news app. So worth the money!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elizabeth"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works just as described.

It was wonderful for the month that it worked. Now, it refuses to connect to wifi which renders it a worthless piece of junk. The extra money spent on a Roku is certainly worth it since will still be working well beyond a month. I guess it is true that you do get what you pay for.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Brian J.

The setup couldn't have been easier. Except for the one time job of typing in the password for my router, the whole procedure could have been done in less than  2 minutes.  I have been using a Google Chromecast, which also performs very well.  However the Chromecast uses the cell phone for control and it is sometimes less than intuitive.  I prefer the separate control on the Fire Stick", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John F.

I'm liking this thing less and less every time I use it. It's nice that we don't have the extra wires up by the tv now, but there are a few things that I don't like about it:- It freezes at least once a day and needs to be reset.- The remote lags- The menu doesn't have the best interface- There are certain apps that are free on Roku that Amazon charges for with the Fire TV StickThe problem with it disconnecting from wireless has been fixed. That being said, I was able to pre-order it with my Prime account and didn't pay full price, so I can't complain too much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.

I plugged it into my tv and within seconds I was setting it up and watching my favorite shows.  The only downside I would say is the fact that you can't cast your whole screen to the tv in order to watch what you want.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nate"}]
