I thought it was a simple plug and play. Which to some extend it is. I would have liked this even more if the remote had at least a volume button to pair with your t.v. I would say this is the only thing \"missing\". I love the fire stick. I haven't owned anything else to compare it to (like a competitor) but I'm happy! I would definitely recommend it. It is slightly bigger than what I thought it would be, not a huge difference. The remote has a great signal distance/range and the fact that the stick is behind the t.v and still finds the signal to pair the remote is fantastic.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Janie"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "did not know i had to also pay for cable to run fire stick??  gosh i really can't afford a cable co bill!  i am paying for internet,amazon,net flix.  wow", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "James Ealy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own two of these and the Fire TV.

So to make it Smart TV I was not smart by buying latest Samsung BD-F7500 4K Upscaling 3D Wi-Fi Blu-ray Disc Player. Thought I can have both blueray player and streaming apps to make my TV a kind of smart. This so called great BD player is slow and used to hung frequently while streaming though apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime etc. Later tried Roku3 and it was fantastic and expensive. When I was browsing Amazon.com then I saw this item was launched new, looked at the specs and looked fantastic. I thought for $39 it is cheaper then lot of other competing products and have great great specs, so ordered immediately. Using this item from last two months and it's so fast and flawless. I like everything about this product after using other streaming device. I also assume the bigger Fire TV would be more more fantastic than this one. But right now I will stick with this because very very happy using this item.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Rocky"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "having fun and works like advertised", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Glenn Leidich \"Chef G\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
