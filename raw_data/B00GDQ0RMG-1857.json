Too bad cable television isn't like cell phone plans that have gotten progressive less expensive over the years.  Cable prices continues to climb and the lack of variety of movies is ridiculous.  This fire stick has far more choices than cable for a less than $10 per month.

I own a Chromecast as well, but enjoy having a dedicated remote and easy to use interface that's provided by the Firestick GUI. Chromecast can be nice to stream YouTube videos and such from a cellphone or tablet, but it's clunky and sometimes difficult to switch between Netflix or YouTube without reseting the device. I haven't had any issues with the Fire Stick in this regard. The inclusion of casual games is also awesome.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John C.
