The primary problem is related to an audio/video sync problem, where the audio doesn't match the on-screen picture. Multiple people are experiencing this same problem as seen in this forum post on Amazon.com and also on multiple reviews of the App itself on Amazon.com.http://smile.amazon.com/HBOGO-Audio-sync-Fire-stick/forum/Fx3THIQES502AOU/Tx3BBSA3JCR2T0P/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin;=B0089BPEZShttp://smile.amazon.com/HBO-GO/product-reviews/B0089BPEZS/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_summary?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=1&sortBy;=byRankDescendingI have contacted Amazon regarding the problem, but all they have done is logged this issue and not yet fixed anything or even stated a timeline for fixing it. This is essentially a paper weight for me, and if it wasn't such a hassle to return it and the extended warranty I bought for it, I'd want a refund.You really dropped the ball on the primary selling feature of this item.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alex"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Took a month to ship but worth the wait.

I love my amazon prime account I tell everyone about the free streaming and two day shipping etc, but this product is limiting, there are not many apps I would use for the device and actually the two apps I wanted were not available, both the optimum app and vudu were unavailable.  Additionally the product glitches cutting out parts of what I'm watching, when I called vs they had me switch hdmi ports and said that it wouldn't happen again and that the port was the problem, it happened again in only a few short moments.  After getting the roku stick, I know that both ports work fine, roku has no glitches, it also has vudu and amazon prime streaming as well. Roku is the better choice.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Melissa \"sita1356\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Wish we could do more but good system", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "thomas simpson"}]
