But every since I have plugged it in it has struggled.  IT does not respond well and blamed it on my network.  Well I tested my network and it is performing great.  Everything else in my house wireless is great.  But not this.  It will not connect to Netflix and it is difficult to log into other apps.  I guess its great if all you wan to watch is prime.

Kudos to Rolla at Amazon support.  The comments below are from my original post.Well, it worked for about 10 minutes, went to all the upgrades, worked perfectly well it was giving me the introductory video, and then about 10 minutes then the remote froze when I was trying to enter my Netflix ID and password.  Then it says it's not connected to the network, funny everything else in my house is connected. Went back and doublecheck my Wi-Fi and cable modem and everything's fine.I go and reset my login Wi-Fi and it shows very good strength, enter the password for the Wi-Fi and now it shows poor strength. My Wi-Fi and modemare approximately 15 feet from the stick.  Prior to this I was connecting to Netflix via my cheap Walmart DVD player, never had an issue. This thing is pathetic. I don't imagine Amazon will post this review.  if Amazon can fix this problem, I'll go back in and change my review, but will never give this thing five stars due to the initial problems.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Skippy"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It skips, and stutters, and now we can't even get it to connect to wifi anymore.
