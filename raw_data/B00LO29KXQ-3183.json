We have a ROKU stick on our downstairs television and decided to purchase the Fire TV Stick for our master bedroom television because of our Amazon Prime account. It is much faster than the ROKU stick and we've had no issues with it at all. We would definitely recommend it over the ROKU stick, especially if you have an Amazon Prime account.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chelsie Perko"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Does every thing needed, worth the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Iowa farm boy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "charles king"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Worth every penny.

It's Totally Amazing!!!  this thing is great!!!  Plenty of movies and music and the small remote is awesome!!! I then purchased three more for the kids. You do need to be an Amazon Prime member for $99 annually after your 30 day free trial period. You will also need a good broadband wireless service provider and router with good speeds. It's well worth the $39 for the TV Fire Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Timothy Oravitz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Even better than expected", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Evelyn James"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Save $$.
