[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "First, the con:It has a limited selection of apps.  I cannot watch my Dish Anywhere DVR recordings through Chromecast.The awesomeness:Set up is ridiculously easy.  The instructions are ridiculously easy to follow.  Everything is pretty much plug-and-play.Once it's set up, the Chromecast does everything for you.  You don't even have to change inputs - as soon as Chromecast detects your device it boots up and switches your input for you.  The only thing you have to do is hit the power button on your tv and open the Chromecast app on your device.  After that, you can use YouTube and Netflix and whatever to your heart's content.I really look forward to seeing more compatibility with other programs and apps.I love this thing.  Too often I have to hunt down the remote to change the channel while watching tv, but since I always keep my phone in my pocket I can play, pause or rewind no matter what I'm doing.Best 35 dollars I've ever spent.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.

Great for streaming You tube videos to my TV. Portability factor is 10, Apps, need more than just 6, albeit it is a new device, and development is slow.

Perfection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brad"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was hesitant at first to invest in this chromecast technology because I own a Playstation 3 and my parents use a roku, I have been pleasantly surprised at how much I use it. I own an iPad and I really like the convenience of simply opening my Netflix app and streaming it to my TV while I lay in bed on facebook, reading for class, etc... I also like to put pandora up on my TV, or to show my roommate a webpage when we're studying for class in our living room (We own multiple). I would suggest this over using a roku, or other streaming devices simply because of cost. More than likely you own a computer, laptop, and/or tablet and all you need is to install the chrome browser and the chromecast add-on and you're all set!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brandon Petersen"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works pretty well with Chrome.
