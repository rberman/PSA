I reluctantly put a small tv in my bedroom after 15+ years.  This does the job of streaming a movie or a show, when needed.  I already had the fire tv box, on the regular tv downstairs.  Def worth $40 to be able to watch an occasional show upstairs, instead of falling asleep on the couch!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kelly"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Seems to be OK, I haven't used it much, since I purchased a Smart TV shortly afterwards.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "The Reader"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The stick arrived on time and the packaging is exceptional. It really was a pleasure to open. The stick works great and is easy to use. The only problem I have with it is that it is attached to my account and I do not have Prime. My wife's account is the main account and she is a Prime member. This is a problem because even though I can get free shipping (same household) I CAN NOT access prime instant video. Customer service was exceptional and offered to switch it for me but the reason I went with Firestick was for SlingTV which is under my account.I'm only giving 4 stars for this reason. I hope in the future Amazon makes Prime instant video available to members of the same household just like shipping.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shawn Buckingham"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love the smooth navigation and apps,WiFi connection is excellent.thumbs up!\ud83d\ude0a", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dandre"}]
