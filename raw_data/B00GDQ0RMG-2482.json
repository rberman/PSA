I bought this for my bedroom. I don't have cable or satellite. Just Hulu and Netflix. What sold me was that it came with a remote. So I am not constantly having to use my phone(con for me. Maybe a pro for others?) The 1 beef I have with the remote is that I cannot control my tv's volume or on/off. My Xbox remote can do it in my living room. Why can't this one do it?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jarrett Lee Bedynek"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I got this for free with the offer for 3 months of Sling TV and even for free its not worth it.  If you can get wireless signal on it at all, you will eventually lose it.  None of the other devices in the vicinity of the this have any problems at all maintaining a wireless signal yet this constantly drops it.  Right now, all it is good for is getting hot while plugged into my TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael Peters"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like the Fire TV Stick  and the Fire TV I have but putting in batteries is a great challenge.

This can make it a nuisance, and it isn't noted anywhere in the description or pictures. Additionally, we have had issues with our Netflix buffering on the TV set using the fire stick. Our other TV sets stream through other means (i.e. playstation) and we have no buffering issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cailin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE this product, awesome movie selection and games, streams really well and the shipping was very fast! better than cable!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kerrissa"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "WOW!  Totally blown away by how easy it was to set up and use.  It's also faster than my DVD player that was streaming the internet.  The ONLY drawback is the round button on the top of the remote, which is the surf button.  It blends in with the remote so, darn, I then had to read the instructions on what that button was for.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marcia Sliger"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "joseph lasky"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I wish I had gotten it sooner!
