I have Netflix and it works out nice, I live out in the woods, so that could be a problem why the other shows keep stopping.  The Streaming from Netflix will start off that way and then gets better.

I didn't realize I needed to download apps for certain things. I didn't think I needed the booklet but I am going to buy it. I think for new users you don't really need it but it could be useful. I wish it had more instructions or should I say some kind of user guide, other than the book, for it. If you're an amazon prime member and use it for more than the 2 day shipping then I recommend buying this. The main streaming boxes have basically the same apps minus 1 or 2. If your predominantly an Apple user then maybe you might want to look at Apple. I would recommend this to anyone though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Working great!
