I have a Chromecast too, but the fact that I can use my Fire Stick without needing anything other than a TV and internet (depending on what I will be using) is so great. I can play games, watch movies/tv shows online, even what the ones I have on my computer using Plex. It's very easy to use and setup, I recommend this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stefany Baez"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "We have a mixed review of the Amazon Fire Stick. We found the initial set up process to be easy and was able to readily use it quickly. Unfortunately, the picture quality is not great. For example, any character dialouge that might be displayed while watching a show is difficult to read.We have had one episode (so far) where accessing content was a problem. We had to re-register in order to regain access, which was a pain.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Larry Beck"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my fire stick.  easy to use and everything we need to watch are tv shows and prime movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Running Mom"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love my Fire TV Stick, I'd love it 5 stars worth if it didn't require hacking to install apps like Kodi but all in all its well worth the price and I no longer need to turn my computer on to stream movies and TV shows to my TV.

I was using my son's x-box to watch ESPN+ and it was good but not great. The fire stick never looses connection. It does get hot if I use the USB power I purchased.

The FireTV is not even in the same league as Roku and somewhat comparable to AppleTV. It's slow, continually reboots, less features and just all around less quality. In my opinion, Roku continues to be the leader and best option for television streaming. Do yourself a favor and go Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MarkR"}]
