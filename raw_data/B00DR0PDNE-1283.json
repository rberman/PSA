It performs as intended but only thing lacking are apps. On the Chromecast page at [...] which links to the relevant section/page in the Playstore app of my mobile i see only 4 apps listed of which 3 are from Google. Although, on doing a simple search like \"chromecast compatible apps\" on Google Playstore mobile appp I can see a wide ranging list of compatible apps, Google should make all the Chromecast compatible apps available through the Chromecast section on the Playstore. I hope Amazon.com continues to ship the product to India. It's much better to get it from here then to buy it from dubious sellers marauding the Indian e-commerce space.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "manoj tirkey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Our first one broke off because we didn't use the extender.
