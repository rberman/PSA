[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "As I am moving in the direction of eliminating my ridiculously expensive DirecTV I wanted something to supplement my network programming I am now receiving by an HDTV antenna. As an Amazon Prime user, the Firestick is a great supplement. It was great to see the series Vikings available and with the Firestick I have been able to start catching up on previous season...very nice.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Bernie Johnson"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Bought this to stream mlb tv.

With that in mind I eventually turned to Fire TV based of extensive research, my personal needs and customer reviews. As it turns out Fire TV stick just does not match up. HBO GO is particularly frustrating. Yes Amazon Prime works just fine but honestly it's content is the least impressive and as such least used.I wouldn't say the Fire TV stick was a poor investment but I certainly wish I would have tried the Fire TV box streamer first as the Stick just doesn't hold up to the speed and consistency of my Xbox. I hope a software update or a newer version will alleviate my issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sylvester Greenwell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "somewhat duplicates what was already downloaded on tv, but does work as stated", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "papabruin44 \"phillip greenfield\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely love it the best 40$ i ever spent.
