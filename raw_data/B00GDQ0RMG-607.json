I was not disappointed. I am a prime member which makes installing and uploading your choices so much faster. Having a remote has made watching Prime TV an even more pleasurable experience. As one reviewer mentioned 'just 7 buttons to learn' how hard can it be? Its NOT! I use to hook my kindle up to the tv to watch prime tv that way. No remote so it wasnt the easiest to maneuver the kindle when i wanted to pause or go back, etc.  I enjoy just leaving the stick where it is and forgetting about it. I had to unplug the kindle every night to read, etc. I also enjoy listening to prime music more. With the Fire Stick it is easier and faster to find selections under Prime Music that I want to listen to. It was ok coming through the kindle but the Fire TV Stick loads everything up super fast. I would HIGHLY recommend investing in this item.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MAPA"}]
