[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is awesome! I haven't had any issues with it so far. I did struggle to open the remote backing but got through it! Ha. The only thing is I wish you can add other TV viewing apps like NBC or ABC so I can catch up on shows that way! But we have a Netflix account and everything was so simple to connect to. I have a Wii and connecting to Netflix is a 30 minute process and even longer when the wireless connection is \"weak.\" But with the stick it surprised me how easy it was! And I love how easy it is to go from one TV to the next. Great job Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Allison"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "\ud83d\udc4d", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nitin"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Paying for each App/channel ends up to be the same cost for cable.
