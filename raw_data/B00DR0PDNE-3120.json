Looking forward to more apps getting on board with this device. Easy to configure", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"TheBenI\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I recently purchased a Google Chromecast device for my techie boyfriend and I wanted to share his findings and thoughts.The challenge of getting audio and video from a computer to a monitor has always required specialized cabling with length limitations, and the challenges are even greater with tablets and smart devices.  However, if a reliable 802.11g wireless connection is available, the Chromecast device becomes a component of your network, the wireless signal becomes your cabling, and certain devices on the network become Chromecast aware, capable of handing off the job of displaying a/v content from the computer monitor to the HDMI-capable TV.Currently, Netflix and YouTube are the only services that are Chromecast-ready, but I\u2019m betting more will jump on the bandwagon.  However, running the Chrome browser and selecting to Chromecast a specific tab works incredibly well.  I\u2019m watching and listening to Tom Petty videos as I type, and there\u2019s zero choppiness or buffering.  Excellent quality requires excellent wireless, which I have here.For only $35, this device is awesome, and should be a part of anybody\u2019s wireless network.  It could be used for any situation that requires displaying audio and video to one or more flat panel TV monitors.  Imagine the possibilities, the ease of implementing this technology, and the affordability!!  Add a couple inexpensive IP surveillance cameras and you would have a surveillance system that can be watched wirelessly on TV or computer.I would give this device more than five stars if I could!
