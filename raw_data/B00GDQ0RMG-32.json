This Fire TV Stick has major connection issues on a busy network. You will be buffering more often, than actually watching a show or movie. STUCK AT 25% - FAIL!

Super easy to hook up. I watched the you tube video on how to open the remote as recommend by a review I read and used a silicone oven mitt to push the cover down to open it. It's hard to open in part because it is small and hard to get leverage.Once that's done you are golden. Remote is super easy and so is navigating the sites. Nice to be able to watch my Netflix in the family room instead going up to my formal living area where my smart TV is.Best purchase! I am trying out Prime and so far love that Too\u203c\ufe0f", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Always looking to save a buck! \"Sandi C.\""}]
