Having trouble with the game controller.  Never used one before.  Could use a little more information on how to get the most out of the until.  Over all like the setup with Speak feature.

I like the concept that I can speak into the remote and it will find everything for me, but for a little effort I can get out of my lazy boy and find what i want on my computer or Kindle Fire and plug it in to my TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BStinger"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Fire TV would be the \u201cperfect\u201d set top box if:>It provided access to the internet using a web browser.>It provided access to UltraViolet digital collection via VUDU or FLIXSTER.>Must subscribe to Amazon Instant Prime in order watch movies>Dose not easily identify free TV or movies content>Does not offer a free streaming media serviceOver all it's OK but could be a lot better", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love it!

I use it for Netflix mostly, but I've also gotten Amazon movies and the picture quality is awesome and it loads super fast.  The voice search only works for Amazon selections, but the unit got me to set up my Chromebook as a remote control for Youtube searches.  This was so easy that I didn't even realize I was doing it until it was working.  I'm very happy with this purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "S.

I'm extremely happy with this product. I had no problems setting up and I've had it for about a month with no issues. I decided to save on cable and cancel.

You do too, but your awesome feature is Voice Search, yet you relegate it to only a few things (Amazon primarily). Why? That's absolutely the reason I returned it.Apple TV is dead simple. I love that it works with my computer running iTunes. Use it daily. Same with my Roku.I had a WD and it worked well with an external hard drive, but again, Roku and Apple beat it out.Amazon, you are SO CLOSE to making the perfect streaming device, but you missed the mark.Universal Voice Search would've made my Apple TV and Roku obsolete.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "David E.
