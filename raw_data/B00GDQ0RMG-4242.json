Dorsey \"sneaker fetish\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "To give a background I have 2 Amazon tablets, 1 high end reader, 2 Fire TV (Box and Stick), Prime, Kids FreeTime for 4 kiddos, and Kindle Unlimited.  Personally I think while the Kids FreeTime is a decent attempt at isolating kids from non age appropriate content I feel as though it is not fully what I was expecting.  So back to the Fire TV stick, as for functionality I like it a lot.  BUT... What parental controls are lame.  I would rather not have my kiddos seeing certain genre movie covers let alone not being able to set a PIN for amazon prime content for PG13+ especially for R and MA content.  Sure you can put a PIN on everything, but then they can't watch a G Prime Movie without me entering the room.  Telling all of them to not look at the screen while I enter in my PIN (how long before they know the PIN anyway knowing as a kid I'd be peering thru my fingers to catch it, wouldn't you?).Edit - Looks like Amazon added another option so you no longer have to see the PIN on the screen.  Instead it can be a series of buttons sequences.  Changing from 3 to 5 stars as I've been pretty happy with itAnyway yes it is pretty decent for what it does, just wish you had better level of parental control (and why the difference between the Fire Tablet and the Fire TV?)  As you can tell to amazon to lock content above PG13 on Tablet, but not on the Fire TV?  I personally expect a bit more in this area...Maybe over time there will be improvements, but as of this review it is a bit lacking.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chad V Aberle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chad"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "no happy with the product.  thought i could stream from pc or non kindle tablet.  not able to.  spent a lot of time trying to figure this out.  support suggested i purchase a kindle to mirror.  good idea, but would have been an addition $134.00.  i will stick with the chromecast. thank you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "clm"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love this device!

So it is possible that it was a hardware issue on our end but our router (Apple Airport Extreme) and wireless network work quickly and flawlessly with numerous other devices.  We did get a connection of sorts, but there was an error message \"connected with problems\" and were completely unable to stream any content at all.  And I have to mention the remote; getting the back cover off for batter installation was incredibly frustrating.  So much force had to be applied I was sure it would break.
