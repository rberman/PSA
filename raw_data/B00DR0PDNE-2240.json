Runs netflix and Pandora without killing your battery.  Great picture quality.  Streams videos from chrome (used it to watch the superbowl!) wish it worked with Amazon prime.

I use it with Plex, Showbox, Pandora... It's an amazing invention. Love my Chromecast!! Only thing that doesn't work too well is when you are on a public network internet, like at a hotel or hospital. For some reason, even if they do not require a sign in page, it won't work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alicia816"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I enjoy using this with my Galaxy Note 10.1.
