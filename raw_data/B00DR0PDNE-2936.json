We only have a laptop to manage this device, so a little annoying because they laptop has to be on while you are streaming.  Those that have some type of tablet or smart phone would be able to manage the streaming through those devices.  Easier, not sure?  Easy set up, no problems getting it ready to stream in minutes.

Here are my pros and cons (and why I replaced it with a Roku)Pros:can control it with your iphone or ipadNetflix and Hulu are availableCons:you can ONLY control it with your iphone or ipad - No remote. I thought it would be ok but it's a pain - especially if you're trying to USE your phone for something else while watching TVNo amazon primeit buffered after the commercial breaks on hulu and was really frustrating.Eventually I gave mine to a friend that wanted to try it and bought a Roku. The Roku I bought was originally $80 and I got it on sale for $40. There is a headphone jack in the remote which my son loves but no one else uses - it's FAST, easy to use, doesn't buffer at all, has AMAZON PRIME!

I can watch whatever I want, and it doesn't cost me $15/movie in the hotel. For the kids, Netflix kills it, so if you are bringing them along, its great! Especially with virtually any childrens programing at your fingertips. I use it with my Kindle Fire 8.9HD and my Nexus 7.2! I use mine in the bedroom, and I am getting one for the living room next. I have cut out $80/ month by dropping my cable provider and just using google play for music and movie rental, netflix for the kids, and HuluPlus, which operates just like regular TV. And I found out that after I canceled all my cable TV, I plugged the coax cable directly into my TV and I get all the channels for free now, local news, ABC NBC PBS Nat Geo, Comedy central, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network...seriously, best purchase for 2013...along with my Nexus 7.2 :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Space Marine"}]
