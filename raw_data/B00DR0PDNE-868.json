[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought is when it first came out in 2013. Was on the waitlist to get it. Great product; did just what we wanted which was to allow me to watch movies and shows streaming from our computer to our TV, and at the same time someone else could use the computer to game or surf. For $25 (that was the launch price) it was like getting another computer to HDMI device!Resale value was great too. Last year we made some changes and didn't need it anymore and I quickly sold it on Craigslist for my full purchase price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GaLady31"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.
