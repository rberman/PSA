I tried refreshing, tried different pages, etc. Just kept doing it. I considered returning it, but just didn't care enough to.

Youtube only and nothing else. It heats up way to much for a small device and I was concerned how that would affect my TV. Since it didn't work the next day, it's been sitting in a drawer. The support is nonexistent. They just send out standard responses to my emails without any real thought.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Dom S"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "easy to install , took us less than a min to install and start watching videos ....

If not, it tends to lag and quit unexpectedly.I found that streaming online video from my computer to Chromecast, like Netflix and HBO Go, used so much bandwidth that it was hard to send signal to TV without freezing or having high quality display.  I do not want to watch a movie at 480 definition on an HDTV - it is not worth it.  Similarly, controlling the device from an iPhone lagged behind when pausing or rewinding with such a delay it was nearly impossible to do so; eventually I tended to not even bother with it.Unless you have a solid internet connection and strong router, or powerful smartphone, its not as easy and seamless as it looks.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Arion Doerr"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love being able to go from watching something on one of my android devices to watching it on my TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "S Richard Cota"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you have a tablet and a HDTV then this is a good buy.  The apps are few right now, but they are starting to grow.  It is a great way to make any regular tv into a \"semi\" smart tv.  It still has some growing to do before I would call it smart.  For instance I would love to stream game apps from my tablet to the tv with this.

Used these to build out a cheap wi-fi home audio system: I connected a google chromecast in to a Panlong HDMI audio extractor (available on amazon) for each \"zone\", then the output from each went in to amplifier, and then amplifier output for each went to my in-ceiling speakers.  Worked like a charm, now I have wifi-controlled audio in every room at 1/10th the cost of Sonos :)Only downside is I had to buy a clunky app on Android to play my MP3s from my phone (3.99) and/or play music from my computer via the chrome browser and google play music.
