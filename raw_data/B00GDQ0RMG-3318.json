Anderson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this product. I use it plugged in behind my tv that is mounted to the wall and works great. I have used roku boxes in the past but there is not enough room for one of those in this situation. They make a stick version as well but the Fire Stick is cheaper and performs just as well. This is also way better than the google device. The google device can't even do half of what this can do and it could barely pickup my wifi that was only 20 ft away. I have no issues with wifi or power and love that it comes with a remote. I have had this for a couple months now and love being able to use it for Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and storing and watching things from the cloud drive.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brandon Biniecki"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works as good as you internet service is reliable. you have great internet service, i would truly recommend this product.

So that's been pretty disappointing. I've talked to Amazon a few times and they can't seem to figure out how to fix it. Other people have had the same problem I've had (where the audio keeps going but the screen goes black). Amazon tries to blame it on Hulu, but Hulu works fine on my laptop, so it's something about the compatibility of the fire stick with Hulu. I hope Amazon figures it out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dahlia Schweitzer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect for parents", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mjl11940"}]
