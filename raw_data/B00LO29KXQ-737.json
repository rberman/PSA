If you got 40 bucks to burn try using it more than 10 feet from wifi and see how funny it is. Amazon should be sued for selling this product. They're customer 'support' will not work with me or answer my questions. All I know is.. if you don't have some world class wifi, you ain't watching nothing.

Worth the price just to have everything in one place. Nice to have Plex and Pluto apps already there too. Installation was easy enough. Bluetooth remote is great, hardest thing to do is get used to NOT pointing the remote at tv.The usb on tv didn't supply enough power for stick. So had to plug it into outlet for correct voltage.
