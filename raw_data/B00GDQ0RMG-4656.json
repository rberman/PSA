You then view a short tutorial on how to use the Fire Stick & then start watching the shows you want. If you're a Prime member, you have tons of movies & TV shows that you can stream for free (listed under the Prime Video tab). If not, you can pay a nominal fee to watch them. The Home tab lists recently used apps & movies and TV shows you've watched. The tab after that lists recommendations for movies & TV shows based on what you've watched. You can also listen to all of the music you've bought from Amazon (under the Music tab) as it (along w/anything else you buy from Amazon) is stored in the cloud. I'm not a gamer, but I understand you can also play games with this, and use several apps. The Fire Stick has been fast in streaming movies, with one exception. I was recently watching a movie that continually buffered. Right from the Fire TV Stick there was a means of asking an Amazon rep to contact me. Seconds after entering my cell phone number, a very courteous, helpful Amazon rep called & walked me though a \"hard re-start\" of my Amazon Fire TV stick. Afterwards, buffering wasn't an issue. (And, this wasn't a long process.) I couldn't believe how fast Amazon contacted me & how helpful the rep was!! I only wish more companies had such great customer service!! For the price, the Fire TV stick is a terrific deal, and being a Prime customer gives you even \"more bang for your buck!\" I'm so happy with mine, that I recently bought one for my son.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
