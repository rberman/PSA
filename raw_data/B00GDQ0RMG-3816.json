[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "WOW! this is such a simple device, and it works just as advertised. Very easy to set up, you just plug it into a HDMI port on your TV and you instantly have Netflix, Amazon Prime, and all the other great content that Amazon offers.  The remote takes a bit to learn, which is always the case, but in no time at all we were able to navigate around perfectly.The only problem is we ordered it to take down to Florida with us for a month, and they were out of stock. We wanted to have our shows and movies where ever we were, as we traveled around the whole state and many times the local cable wasn't very good, or there wasn't much on that night (a frequent problem, which is why we ditched cable and satellite at home and stream everything now). So we couldn't use it on our trip. So I can only review what it was like on our own TV so far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "horn.trader"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Fire TV Stick!

I have the box and NO ISSUES. I got the stick for buddy and we hooked up and found you need to favor the side of the TV the stick is located for remote control to work proper, 60\" TV. Makes sense I guess since a big TV is blocking communication? Signal was Strong also to be clear. Maybe it was just us and an odd issue, And no one else has noticed this? but it was an obvious issue in our case... Set up is simple and the good thing about stick is it's convenient to move from TV to TV.

I have two Roku 3's and s chromecast so when this thing came out on special for $19 I thought I would give it a try but that was the worst $19 spent. I put this on my bedroom tv where my chromecast was working just fine and I can't make it through one movie or tv show without it shutting down saying it can't connect. I had a decent wifi signal to start with so I added a wifi extender to see if that was the problem and now I get almost 50mbps in there and it still shuts off.
