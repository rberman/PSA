[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent device.  I can see anything from my Galaxy S5 on my 55\" plasma TV.  Much easier to use YouTube or any of the other apps using my phone than with the awkward interfaces my TV and blu-ray provide for their apps.  Extremely easy to connect and get up and running. Note, with the S5 you need to go to Settings|Wifi|Advanced (from the dropdown, top right)) and turn Smart network switch to OFF in order to complete the setup.  You will be able to re-enable after initial set-up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A-Han The HR King"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fun and cheap!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.
