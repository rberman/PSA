[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "If you just want to use it for Netflix ETC. then it is good. If you\u2019re using the Chromecast for Chrome on your laptop to project tabs, the video quality and audio can dump quite a bit. It\u2019s almost useless in IOS you can't cast screens and in chrome you can't even cast tabs. I bought with the device under the impression you could mirror your screen from your laptop, but you can't........there is terrible lag. The technology states it is still in experimental mode.

I tested with Youtube and Plex in an old LCD TV, transmitting from my cell (Android) and my Macbook. It's a plug'n'play product!

Now we spend significantly more time in the room due to the ease of use of this device and the tv when trying to watch or listen to any number of things.  Obviously this is a clear winner for Netflix customers.  But i use it quite often when trying to play music from my phone, show pictures, let guests control things.
