I browsed the online help and talked with some people and did all the tricks they said to do I still can not get it to work on my Sanyo.When it streams I don't have any issues with buffering or anything like that, its just frustrating I can't use it in the livingroom like I had intended.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cynthia Jones \"Tech Junkie\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.
