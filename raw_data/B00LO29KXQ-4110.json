My HDTV isn't smart on it's own. I had been using a Blu-Ray player to get it a brain.  Wrong move. I think the manufacturer has stopped updating the device. At least with the Fire TV Stick, I feel like I'll be able to get updates as needed with Amazon.Thanks, Amazon, for a way to get Prime content on my TV. Thank you for including other apps like Netflix. Everything runs so smoothly!  Netflix on my other device stops and starts.  No errors with the Fire TV Stick.  I'm really enjoying what I'll call bonus content like the Gaiam Channel and other workout channels. These channels have a more on-demand kind of feel and are really nice. The game selection seemed a little weak.I have a Fire Tablet and I have downloaded the Fire TV app on other devices. The app works nicely as a remote; it's taking some practice to get my swiping just right. Voice search runs without a glitch.Having a Fire Tablet is a plus. I do like switching screens as I move about the house. I have developed the habit of looking up info about the movies and shows as I watched them. Having IMDB on my Fire providing scene trivia as I watch on the TV is so cool.This is the complaints section. My major complaint is how Amazon continues to ignore Google's existence. I want the real You Tube, not a third-party workaround. I also have Chromecast. It would be nice if Fire offered similar projection functionality. I really wish either device, preferably Chromecast, would allow me to listen to Audible via my TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NuJoi \"Create with me\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is AWESOME!!!!

I have had it about 2 months now and it is very easy to use, I don't have to use my PC, phone, or tablet like a chromecast, and much smaller then a Roku.  It took about 2 minutes to set up and is a breeze to use, I plan on buying 3 more for my kids.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Schmedy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "having had other media stream players, this one is very fast.
