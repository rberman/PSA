I bought this when I knew I was going to be in bed for a few days after an injury.  Plugged it in, configured my account settings and has worked flawlessly ever since.  The power adapter is kind of a bummer but the other option is to use up another HDMI port which if you don't have open ones to spare is a non-starter.  I configured my Netflix account as well and have everything I use on one little device about the size of a flash drive.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James S Coryat Jr"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "In theory, this is a great thing.

I love them and debating about a third.  None of my TVs are Smart TVs.  Before the Fire Stick came along I was using Chromecast for Netflix.  I was disappointed I couldn't watch Amazon Prime shows on it.  I signed up for the preorder of the Fire Stick and was one of the first ones to receive it.  Ever since then my Chromecast got up into a drawer.  The Fire Stick does everything I used my Chromecast for and even more.  Hopefully this holiday season there will be a sell and I will buy several as Christmas presents.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NiceMann"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I've been a ROKU fan and absolutely love it. However, the techie that I am,  I thought I would try the Fire Stick. The specs seem great but its a piece of crap. I thought the usability would be great because it coming from Amazon but it that was not the case. After three days of using it, I received a software update and thats when this really went to $hit. The remote just doesn't respond correctly and everything keeps freezing up. The remote doesn't work to the point of where I cannot even do a factory reset.  DO NOT buy this crap. The ROKU is much much better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this TV stick. I have Amazon prime, my kids love to watch their favorite cartoons in the video library. This is the perfect solution. It is very easy to install. Easy to use.
