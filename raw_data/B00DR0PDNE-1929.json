[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love not having to put my laptop next to the tv and hooking up hdmi cords to play stuff on the tv. I have never owned a roku or any other streaming device so when i found this at it's cheap price I wanted to try it out. If using one of the supported apps it does not tie up your computer. I can play shows from netflix and not have to have it running full screen. The only time you have to run full screen is Chrome mirroring which I had read and expected. Great little device, very easy set up.Set up is really simple and in a matter of 10 minutes you're up and running. What I really like about Chromecast is that once you set it up its done, that's it! You name your device and no more back tracking or resetting.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Johnny Molina"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Have been flinging TV shows from apps on my android cell phone to chromecast to watch on my HDTV.
