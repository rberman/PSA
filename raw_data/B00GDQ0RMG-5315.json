They both seem to stream services I use just fine.  However, the Roku can work with both IR and RF remotes and this only works with RF.  That means you can't use most universal remotes with this product.  So I can't use my expensive Harmony remote with this.  That said, the menu structure really does favor Amazon as you might expect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BobV"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This fire stick is amazing i love it but.... i wish they had a turn off button rather then leave it on sleep mode! things shouldn't be kept on sleep mode unless someone here knows what i am doing wrong. the instruction says it just goes on sleep mode and if you don't want to use it disconnect the outlet lol. I don't think that is healthy for the life of the stick if you disconnect when its still on. Other then that I love this thing the wifi is great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Roku is still the bomb.

Can run games (though a bluetooth game controller is highly recommended), do Netflix and stream local videos.  One caveat - no microSD slot, which would have pushed this into the 5-star range.  The 8 GBs on the stick go oh so quickly (esp. if you use the stick for video game emulation).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

Setup took less than ten minutes,  including the start up video. I hadn't planned to use the optional power cord just to save some electrical spaghetti,  but there wasn't enough power in the port alone. Streaming is nice and smooth and connectivity with Spotify went well. Overall, I'm thrilled!  I wanted to order one as a birthday present next month, but it looks like the next shipment won't be ready until February.  Ah, well. This little gadget is definitely worth the wait.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kate"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "easy to setup and works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark L Thompson"}]
