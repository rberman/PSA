[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "The fire stick has started to overheat-it gets so hot that it can't be touched, and when it overheats the playback becomes choppy and the video eventually freezes while the audio continues.  I've taken it out of service and am waiting for a response from Amazon.  Hopefully this is an isolated incident and Amazon will quickly make it right.It's located in a position where there is ample air flow in a room that is kept at 65 degrees.Update:  Amazon quickly replaced this one and send a prepaid shipping label to have my overheating unit returned to their engineering dept.  The replacement unit works as it should without the overheating, picture freezing and other quirks.  Kudo's to Amazon for their customer service and quick response.  I've also updated my rating to reflect the replacement, working unit.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael Chiodo"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The stick will definitely get \"warm\" during use (I'm using the included AC adapter) and drop the network connection requiring a power disconnect to re-enable networking.

This does everything you need but could lack full features. This is a great secondary device or a device for a bedroom or a children room. If you are looking for a all in one solution look into the larger Fire Tv. I am very happy with my Fire Stick, I would buy one for each TV in the house!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bryan B"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It was good when it worked, but it would not stay connected to the wireless internet.  My smartphone, laptop, and tablet all do without a dropped connection in a couple of years.  This dropped every 20 minutes or so - or would work all the way through a show and then not work the next time I tried.  When it worked it was pretty slick but I spent hours trying to find a work-around.  Back to accessing Prime through my Smart TV but the other TVs in the house are out of luck.  I was disappointed and really wanted it to work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "ccjay"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "So far, it's a dud.  Video with no sound, after an hour with a customer service agent whose English was marginal I requested a supervisor.  He then admitted that there is a \"problem,\" they are aware of it and will try to get it fixed in the next few days.  Fine, why take me through almost an hour of troubleshooting if you know there is a problem with the sound, you have a large volume of calls regarding the same issue and you know it is a software update issue.

When I saw that Amazon was coming out with the TV stick, I knew this is what he would want and Christmas was coming up.  Instantly I knew we would have issues in our house because we have several WiFi dead-zones. So when the stick arrived and we plugged it in, sure enough it had connection issues. SO FOR ALL  OF YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS ISSUE, do what we did and buy a WiFi extender or a more powerful router altogether. Soon as we had the WiFi issues settled, the stick worked like a charm.

That didn't even start on any movies I might want to watch!It was a ripoff. All the Ads make it sound like 'all you need is this device to watch any streaming program or movie' on your TV from the Internet... Nooo... you have to pay for them just like Pay Per View or any Netflix or Cable Viewing.So I had it taken back. For the $2 - $3 every show I want to watch (5-6 shows a night) that would add up to more than my Charter Cable Bill!!
