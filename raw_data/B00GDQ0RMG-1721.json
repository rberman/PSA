The Android App for your phone however is buggy and freezes up. Wish I knew about it before purchasing a Chromecast, which doesn't allow you access to Amazon Prime stuff.  The Chromecast app was far superior for Android though.. you could fully control it with your phone.  This one, not so much.  Streaming quality has been good so far.. have watched several Prime and Netflix movies on my 8 year old Panasonic HDTV. with no buffering or quality issues. .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "MarkinNC"}]
