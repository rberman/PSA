[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Useless device, terrible handcontrol .. too sensitive, will not stream netflix. unfixable still. Netflix cant fix it, Amazon tech cant fix it, they gave me a full refund.  my roku units (all three work wonderfully) as well as my apple tv, so it is NOT a streaming problem. it is a Firestick SOFTWARE problem.beware buying this if you enjoy netflix.  its junk.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "donna wieder"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karen A Wheeler"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Better than advertised. I also downloaded the free app from the Amazon appstore for my smartphone to make it a voice activated remote to use with the Firestick so no need to order theirs and spend extra money. Boosted signal strength and no issue's with buffering at all although I didn't often have an issue before.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bruce Jones"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my new fire stick! It's amazing how now I can watch my movies, listen to my music and play games anywhere!!!! Yes, ! It's better than using my phone! Now I don't have to use my phone power, and everyone can enjoy off anything with a  hdmi port, hotels,  hospitals, sleep overs, the office, at home, the possibilities are endless!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Natonya Cook"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great but something they don't shown on the commercial is that these require power as HDMI ports do not output it. The stick comes with a USB cord for power and an AC to USB power mini-brick. I have a Samsung TV with a USB \"service\" port. I was able to plug the USB power line in there. Upon boot the stick said that I had plugged into a power source with inadequate power sourcing ability. I believe that the stick says this if it gets power but does not detect their official mini-brick. Obviously if the power was inadequate it wouldn't be able to come on and tell me so.  For this deceptive discretion I have knocked it down to 4 stars. It otherwise works very well and is very fast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jay"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazon did it again....another great product. Easy to use.

Does everything the more expensive Fire TV does except the more intensive games.  If you're only interested in streaming media, you might as well save money and get this.
