Lots of other channels that seemed useless to me. For what it offers I think it would be much better priced around $30-40 not the $80 I paid. I ended up going with the Apple TV and I'm much happier. Side by side the Apple is much quicker and easier to use, less confusing when searching for channels. I did however like the voice search, which ended up being a nice feature.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Lee Vanderlip"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have only been using it one day but so far am very satisfied with my fire tv. Easy set up but then didn't know-how to get the content to run. I discovered I had to purchase ( free through Amazon) and download \"connection apps\" on both the fire tv and my kindle fire HDX. I don't have the fastest internet connection so have had a few times where pauses occurred. Have not figured out how to play games without controller, but am not too concerned about that, tho it would be nice. Am hoping to b e able to downgrade to a less expensive Dish package now. I got my fire tv for $80, so all in all am very satisfied so far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Kathy Schutte"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Deanna Sands"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far, I love it.
