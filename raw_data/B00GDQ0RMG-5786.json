[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I had been contemplating the fire tv box for awhile so I jumped at the chance to purchase this when they rolled out the special prime member rate the back in October for $19, though I probably would have purchased it for the $39 eventually, so far I am pretty happy with it the apps are more updated than with the roku boxes that I had already but it is lacking several that I would really like to have like vudu, google play and target ticket that you can get with roku.  It also seems to have a harder time connecting to the internet than the rokus do, but once it is up and running it is great especially if you are watching amazon content the instant play is nice and the recommendations update every time you go back to the home page.  Overall I'd recommend it especially if you own amazon content hopefully they will eventually get more apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Danielle"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Twitch app is terrible. Seems to only support low quality streaming, not 1080p hi-def. No search functionality. No favoriting or user login.

I bought this after the chromecast broke.  Im glad i did, once the 10-15 min update went through its been running flawless.  The menus are very easy to understand.  The only minor gripe is that it would be cool if Google could've included the voice remote (I know you can buy it for extra).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "quackslayer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my amazon strick!!

But now I am having problems where the thing freezes up either while you are browsing or just watching netflix. The only way to fix this, is to unplug it from the power cord and plug it back in. I bought this thing for two reasons, one, because my girlfriend don't know how to use my playstation 3 and she likes to watch her shows on the bedroom, so I was going to get the Roku stick. Instead, I decided to give this a try. Second, it was the promotional prize for being a prime member, so for $20 can't go wrong. I am looking to return this Fire Stick soon. Not sure if there is a fix for this or anyone else is having the same problem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cris0911"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Super fast streaming.
