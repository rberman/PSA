On December 3th I walked in to a Staples office supply store and to my shock there was a full display on the Amazon fire tv sticks for sale. Anybody else in the same situation I suggest that you too leave a negative comment to let Amazon know that we are not satisfied.that they filled retail orders before completely filling their customers orders. I also suggest if you're in the same situation that you call The Better Business Bureau to let them know what they are doing I just balled my complaint.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/7", "author": "scifi guy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We went to the beach for the (US) thanksgiving weekend and brought this along for a test drive.  The house we stayed in did not have high speed (gamer quality) internet-just your standard generic router and it was slow to load browser content.I plugged in the Fire Stick and it did take a while to download and install the software updates.  The device was already loaded with my account information (similar to how kindles come ready to use). Once we went through a simple tutorial, I verified my account information, chose some settings, and was ready to watch TV.  Pretty simple.I really liked the idea that I could just throw this in a suitcase and I could watch Prime movies or listen to music when traveling. Please not that you can only use this with a TV that has HDMI input.I would also recommend the Fire TV Stick for anyone in the market for a new Blu Ray DVD.  Recently we replaced our DVD and really had to dig around to find one that could access amazon.  Having this would have made replacing our DVD a lot easier.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gingermonkey"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product at this price. Become hot and sluggish after 2 hours use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tao Wang"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So this little power house blows the Roku LT I previously used for streaming media out of the water!  It has my most commonly used apps (Netflix, Crackle, Flixster), access to tons more, and is simply amazing for Prime.  With other streaming media players, I've noticed painful lags in Prime streaming media which led to avoiding watching much of it.  If you are a Prime subscriber, this really makes the subscription well worth it!Some product PROS:- The remote is super responsive and incredibly easy to lose - I'm thinking of attaching it to my dog to avoid it getting sucked into the realm of nothingness that is the couch cushions.- The look of the unit (the stick and the remote) is super sleek and sexy.  For electronics.- The HDMI extender is the best idea as many TVs don't have too much room to stick the device into; the power cord is comfortably long and reaches the plug with room to spare.  It also comes with a USB plug, if you have some of those outlets too!- The quality of what I watch is excellent!  With my LT, it only streamed 720p.  I forgot my TV was capable of 1080p so when I plugged the stick in it had AMAZING CLARITY!  My eyeballs almost melted out of my face when I saw how old Matt Smith really looks.- Buffering is a thing of the past!  Everything is really so fast and not frustrating to watch because it has to stop and load right at the good parts.- The home screen is optimized for Prime viewing, allowing you to add items from the Prime library to your Watchlist for easy access and quick viewing.- Good selection of fun (free trial version) games; Badlands and Tetris are pretty addictive and easy to play with the standard remote and have provided a few hours of entertainment so far.And some CONS:- The Miracast function, which I was incredibly stoked about, does not work.  Trying to connect a Miracast able phone and laptop has not succeeded which is a bummer as that was something I could not wait to try.  It seems like sharing off the Fire tablet and phones works like a charm; hopefully it's a bug or something that will be fixed with a download in the coming year.- After about the second day of use, I noticed a strange buzzing that would occur while watching something.  It only lasts a second or two and can be best described as the sound you hear when plugging an audio cord in to a live connection - a low buzz/hum.  I checked all the connections and it doesn't happen when playing Xbox or watching regular TV.  It hasn't stopped or gotten any worse and with the warranty Amazon offered, I figure I can give it about a month before possibly sending it in for repair/replacement.Overall, this is a fantastic purchase for anyone who streams their media and especially Prime users - this this really takes your TV experience to the next level and at the price is a great purchase!  Amazon is really upping their game when it comes to infiltrating your living room and electronics experience - I'm definitely considering a Fire tablet to further my home viewing experience and becoming a little more plugged in.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Decadent Tenshi"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "We have apple tv, roku 2, roku 3, and the fire tv stick.The fire tv stick is the only one that is completely unusable.

I purchased two of these for $19 each for my kids, and it's looking like one of the best Amazon buys ever made.  After reviewing the very simple directions, setup is quick and intuitive.  No problems with setup, navigation, or reception with either one.  I suspect at least some of the problems experienced by others is the result of NOT plugging it into a regular power outlet.  I wish I could control access to specific Amazon Prime content (by rating) from my online account, but perhaps that will eventually come.Update:  I don't understand how/why some people can't make this work.  I've used the two Firesticks on three different TVs from three different manufacturers, including an ancient DLP model.  They've worked great on all of them.  I wished I would have bought a couple more at $19, but they are easily worth $39.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "GBS"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I thought this was a really neat device until I tried to play some music on it using the Prime music service as well as YouTube.
