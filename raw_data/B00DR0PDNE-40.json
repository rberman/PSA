Nothing but frustration. The very definition of nuisance. Every time I try to use it, something goes wrong. I either have to restart my internet, restart my computer, delete and redownload the app, or delete and redownload the extension. HEY GOOGLE! FIX IT!

In reality Google Music Play--one of the main apps for which you would consider buying this in the first place--only connects with the bleeding dongle when it feels like it.
