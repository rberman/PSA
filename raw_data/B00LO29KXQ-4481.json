[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "The stick itself is great; no complaints. It's very easy to use. There are only two downsides.1) you can't turn it off. there is a sleep mode, but it's buried in the settings.2) The remote is low quality. I've only been using it about two months and sometimes I have to push the buttons a couple times to get it to work. Not sure if it's a design flaw or if I just watch more Netflix than the average person so it's wearing it down faster.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Arinae"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this gadget make everything easy to manage and convenient.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gary"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing addition to our home theater!!!

It's great for your Amazon Prime viewing and there are some cool mini games that you can actually control with this itsy bitsy remote that's a nice feature.  There is also access to your cloud photos which I have none at the time so I can't comment on how that works, but it's a nice feature.  There are some cooking apps available for download, they all suck badly.Outside of Amazon related apps, so products like YouTube, Netflix and some of the other streamed software options run poorly and slowly compared to the Amazon Prime. It is a noticeable step down in performance compared to my PS3, Vizio smart TVs, and even a 10 year old HP Pavilion running on windows XP.There are some cool mini games that you can actually control with this itsy bitsy remote that's a nice feature.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
