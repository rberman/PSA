I decided to give this a go as I got it on the special $19.00 price. I guess you can call it an impulse buy.  Anyway, after i played with it this weekend. I love it! It's super snappy and fast to use the menu navigation. I know it's wrong to say that Roku is not user friendly but i find the layout on Amazon's stick is better!! The remote is thin and light weight.  It's Super easy to hook up.  The app is even better cuz u can use voice search, Or type in what you want to watch.  As opposed to arrow keys and a screen keyboard.  All in all.... I should have waited till the end of this year and gotten this stick as opposed to the roku and the chromecast.  But I do have a wife and brother to shop for this christmas??? guess what will be in their stockings!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ryan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome purchase!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aidan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Schwieet"}]
