In my opinion as a business traveler the ability to connect to Wifi networks that have a web-based authentication page, i.e. most hotels, is a key differentiating feature from Chromecast. Netflix and Amazon instant video work great. One caveat, this isn't the fault of the device, but your ability to use HBO Go or similar apps depends on the good will of your cable company. Comcast/Xfinity currently doesn't support HBO Go on Fire TV, to which I say \"Boo Comcast!\". Again, not the fault of the device but if support for HBO Go (or anything else that you will have to authenticate with your cable provider), then check first to see if your cable company supports Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
