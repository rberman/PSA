[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "To be honest, I hate the fire stick. Instead of spending $40 on the fire stick; I should have just got cable. Because to use any of the things that are advertised, you have to have subscriptions: HBO Go, Encore, History Channel, ect. The thing I learned about the Amazon Fire Stick is that, its a really cool way to access everything you have to have a subscription for. The Fire Stick is poorly represted as to what it actually is/does. You have to keep it plugged in. I basically spent $40 to do everything I can do on my game system. So, to me the Fire Stick was a waste of money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Steffanie Taylor"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Ire", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Reviewer123"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!

It had a slightly laggy interface, but it streamed well; however, that recently changed and I have to knock it down.I recently moved and switched Internet Service Providers.  I hadn't set up my computer yet and was strictly using the internet for my Fire Stick while I waited for them to fix my cable. A long story, a whole lot of phone calls to my ISP, and several days later, my Fire Stick was constantly buffering, dropping internet signal. It was a general nightmare. The buffering was so bad I couldn't watch anything (one hour to watch one episode of a 20 min sit com is unacceptable).  Since I work from home, I was terrified as to what was going to happen when I started work.Well, imagine my surprise when I was able to flawlessly work all day, while streaming Netflix on my laptop with zero issues.  Nothing dropped, nothing buffered. Quality was perfect.  I went back to my Fire Stick and the buffering nightmare returned.  It finally dawned on me that, despite the fact that I had never had these problems before, the issue might be with the Fire Stick.I dug out the Roku 2 and hooked it up and the problem was instantly solved.  The extra fun part is I moved the Fire Stick to the other television, far away from the modem, and it seems to work there fine, without all the buffering nonsense.So, my non-technically educated guess is the Fire Stick doesn't like the \"noise\" from my new ISP's modem (they were about 2 feet apart).  My prior ISP was FIOS and my new one is cable.  This is the only explanation I can come up with to explain why I never experienced any issues until I switched providers.  To me, that is a very serious design flaw because it obviously doesn't affect the Roku.Given this particular flaw drastically limits where you can place a Fire Stick, I can't rate this higher than 2 stars.  If I didn't have a second television, the Fire Stick would have been rendered completely unusable because of this issue.  I'm also glad I figured this out before I called my ISP again.  I wasted several hours on the phone with them over what turned out not to be their fault.Tl;DR - going back to my Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "StarlaC"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "If I could return it, I would, but I've had it 4 months, so I think it's too late. It takes hits where my Vizio tv hiccups, like an interrupted signal. It buffers too much on a 50Mbps internet connection. Recently, when I would scroll down one program choice, it would auto-scroll through the entire list. I needed a factory reset to clear that problem, which meant I had to redo all of my preference customizations. It runs very hot, which might be the cause of my problems.
