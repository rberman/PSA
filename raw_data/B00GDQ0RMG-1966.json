It operates smoothly and effectively. Memory size is enough for what I use it for. I think that the game controller is a bite costly and should be marketed more transparently that it is required for use of some more interesting games.The entertainment user interface is sometimes a bite difficult for those with eclectic tastes. It is geared more toward, what I feel like is a single user and like Netflix, it is difficult to get a clear picture of other types of movies and shows for those with a plethora of tastes. I have Chromecast also. The two cannot be compared. The Firestick can be used with out another device. If Amazon were to add a less expensive controller, a similar keyboard for searching, and (it may already have this capabilities, new to the product) a dedicated web browser, this would be the ultimate entertainment system. I must say I am not completely sure this can be for serious gamers but it has possibility.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The fire stick has exceeded my expectations.

Slightly better UI and faster performance than our Roku streaming stick, but comparable in content. Both support the content providers we use, Amazon, Vudu, Netflix, neither support itunes which is an issue with apple not Amazon or Roku. I actually like it better than I though I would. I really like the idea I can take it on a trip and just plug it into a TV anywhere.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Keith Myers"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works ok, still trying to figure out everything", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patricia Courtney"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product, easy to setup and works as well as my smart TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric Savoy"}]
