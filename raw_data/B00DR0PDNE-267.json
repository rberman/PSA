If your computer doesn't have a fast processor (I suggest at LEAST i5 dual core, but i7 quad core would be better), the streaming often gets jittery as it can't keep up with pulling it from the web and sending it to the stick.It's just not ready for public use yet! Get a Roku or FireTV.Revised: The other thing is that this does not have apps like other streaming devices, it relies on your computer or Android tablet (sorry iPhone/iPad users) and I understood that when I purchased it. In order to stream from the computer, you need to use Chrome browser. Okay, I get that too.  You also need to install the Google Cast extension. After doing that, even when I'm not streaming to the Chromecast stick, any video playing in Chrome drives the CPU higher than normal (not nearly as high as streaming) which still gets the laptop fan going and will drain battery much quicker when not plugged in.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Timothy A Martin"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It seems to work well with older android 4.1 and 4.2.
