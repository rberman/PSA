I watch a lot of these and I get an error on each one, would love to see this get rectified and allow for it.  I'd rather watch these LIVE streamed shows on my big screen over my phone or iPad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kendra R."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "After some time in learning its working instructions, I have and can finally say Hallelujah.
