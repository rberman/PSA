There were no glitches.  I even use it from my iPhone4S.  Our grandson likes to watch Pluto cartoons on YouTube.  Anything that you can display in your browser, you can watch on your big screen TV.  I also use it to stream Amazon MyPrime movies. The operation of Chromecast  is very simple.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William Gustafson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For the price it is a great device, streaming video from chrome to the TV is poor at best on average, a lot of buffering.

But, I've had this for a whole day now and am still not able to set it up.  I'm pretty knowledgeable about tech, so its not like i'm a newbie.  I first tried the setup using my desktop, but after it found the Chromecast and I clicked go ahead and set it up, my wireless network dropped out.  Tried it again, same thing.  So, then I tried using my Nexus 10 figuring since it was a Google product it should work just fine... no such luck.  Again my wireless network dropped out when trying to run the setup.  So, now i figure I have a problem with my wireless router, so I'll get out the laptop and plug into my router with a cable and set it up that way.  Wrong!  This can't be setup using a wired LAN.  So, now I have to figure out what settings in my wireless router I have to change to get this thing configured.  So, I'm pretty disappointed at the moment.  I'll update once I get it working.**********UPDATE**********My Thinkpad would get farther along in the setup procedure than my Nexus 10 or desktop.  The setup would get to a point where it would say there is a problem with my wireless setup in the router. I disabled security on it momentarily and the chromecast setup completed. Then I turned security back on. Works as intended now, but this was a pain...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "slednboard"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "None of my devices fits to it, I cant use it and sold it again.
