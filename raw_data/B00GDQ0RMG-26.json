Make certain you have your wifi password for the installation. My only complaint is I didn't know I had to install the Netflix app since it was my first experience with it and I never saw it stated anywhere. I contacted the Help Center through the Firestick contact list, requesting a call back which was immediate. While I was explaining my problem, I was scrolling around and realized I had to download the Netflix app. I explained that to the customer service rep and he waited for me to complete the installation just to be sure everything worked. Now that it's up and running, I am so pleased with this purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Laurie PW"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I wished I would have gotten it sooner.
