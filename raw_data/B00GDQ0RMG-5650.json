I have two Rokus, one on a different floor, probably 50 ft away from my modem, and the reception is fine.  I put the stick in a room maybe 20 ft from the modem, and it cannot hold the signal.  I am either going to have to move my modem, or attach the Stick to the tv I use for a computer monitor in my office.  I do not care to watch tv at my desk.  I tried it, just to see the selection, and find the Roku selection much better plus I had loaded many \"private\" channels ( addresses available if you subscribe to the free weekly Roku newsletter) to the Roku.  .  Not sure what I'm going to do with the stick, but sure am disappointed.  I had hoped to be able to watch movies on that tv..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dollhunter \"Diana\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "love it... except, it creates signal interference with over the air antenna signal. Strong enough to cause the TV to lose signal every 10, 20, 30 seconds. BUMMER. I have to unplug the Fire Stick to watch antenna TV. I unplugged the power supply from the wall and the interference stops. I unplugged the Fire Stick from the power supply, the power supply still plugged in, interference stops. It's not the power supply, it is the Fire Stick. It's emitting the signal interference.This needs to be addressed by Amazon and a remedy provided those of us with the issue. I also have an Apple TV and that's not an issue with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carl Edwards"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I've had nothing but setup problems,  made several calls to customer service tech line, gotten nowhere.

For the price, it's a very good device, but as other reviewers mentioned, this is best for people who use Amazon contents; for others including myself, this might not be the best choice. I wanted to use this to watch Youtube videos and play around with a lot of Android apps, and was disappointed with the navigation system and USB/Bluetooth accessories/apps incompatibility which completely killed all my excitement to use it as my Media Center and a big screen computer. If I could somehow flash pure Android into this device, I might use it, if not, it will be just a waste of my time and $25 since I don't use Amazon's video contents.Few days later, I instead bought the $60 Winbook 7\" Windows 8.1 tablet from Microcenter which featured HDMI, bluetooth, USB ports and Micro SD slot. I connected this tablet to my 47\" 3D Smart TV, connected wireless keyboard and mouse, and now my TV is a huge computer which serves all my purposes, something which I expected from the Amazon Fire TV Stick, but it could not deliver.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Kaji Lama"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a really nice, small device that works as it should. Using the Fire TV stick is binging your Amazon content where it should be - to your living room. Over the years, I purchased a number of songs on Amazon and I use Amazon Prime to watch videos. All of this happened on my laptop. Now, I have the same content in my living room, ready to use at the tap of the remote control. I love it, and I am rediscovering content I own but forgot about. How great is that?We have it connected to an ASUS computer LED monitor and with a 90 degree adapter it fits perfectly into the back. It also has no problem getting a wireless signal in our house - although the router is on the second floor. Set-up was a breeze, took me less than 5 minutes and I was ready to go. The menu takes some getting used to and could respond a bit faster, but it works well with the remote. For the price, the little Fire TV stick is well worth it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "K.

I jumped on it at that price because we were looking for streaming device for our second TV. I'm blow away by the quality of this product. Here's my review.Responsible, Sustainable Product Packaging:It came in a cardboard box that looked like it had been designed by a sustainable designer for a watch or jewelry. The only plastic used in packaging was the thin transparent bags that exactly fit the charger, the dongle and the remote. Everything else was arranged in its place in the cardboard box. For those of you who are interested in responsible product packaging - this is one to learn from. Job well done, Amazon.Pros:It's easy to assemble, and install. We had it up in 10 minutes. We also have a Roku. Everything we already watch on the Roku we can also watch on this device, but now on our other TV.Picture quality is excellent. The number of apps available is pretty decent. We installed the Youtube app right away. Amazon prime movies look great on the TV. Many of the other apps we've installed on Fire TV Stick are well designed. Smithsonian Channel is breathtaking. Changing between menus is easy and intuitive through out. If you have and like you're Roku 3, you'll find this interface familiar and easy to manage.The included remote is simple and intuitive. You can download the android app for your own phone or tablet to make entering choices a lot easier, too.We've had it for a few days now and are well pleased. Prime movies are a snap.This is not a Chromecast. You don't have to have a computer or tablet on in order to view things streamed via your computer. Yet if you want to stream a particular Youtube video to your television, you can with this device from your computer, phone or tablet.Cons:The Fire TV Stick is set up to encourage its owners to view Amazon's videos. If you don't have Amazon prime, it could make you a bit frustrated that the first thing you always see is a bunch of movies you're probably never going to watch. If you *have* Amazon Prime, your experience will be pretty enjoyable. Roku is a little more subtle about it. You can arrange your channels (Amazon calls them apps) right at the top of your home page on Roku. Not so much with Amazon Fire TV Stick. If it doesn't appear on the \"recent\" menu, you'll have to dig down into the menu nest to find your preferred channels (like YouTube or Smithsonian.)The Second criticism I have is for the lack of an aggregate news feed. Roku has a news aggregator that is part of its interface and not an app, so you can click one button to check out the headlines from multiple news sources while you're shaving or dressing for work. Amazon doesn't have an included aggregate news feed, but instead relies on apps that are from separate news outlets. You watch one clip and it stops. Then you have to click another news clip. If you want a more rounded news experience, you have to manually go between apps to find news. It's not as convenient as Roku's aggregate feed, where you'll get about fifteen to twenty minutes of clips from multiple news outlets. How about it, Amazon?Overall:If price is no object, a Roku 3 is still hard to beat. If you're a Prime Movie and TV fan, you'll enjoy using this device. We have prime, so it's a working solution for us.Edit 2015.01.27:I will offer one peeve that has cropped up. For the FireTV apps (PBS, for example), search function has to happen through the remote. If you're looking for \"Grantchester\", you'll have to wiggle up and down that crummy interface on the FireTV with the little remote. You can't type it in from your Android-enabled remote app. You can't speak it in from there either. The android-enabled remote app has either been hampered on purpose, or poorly designed. Amazon - please fix this. Intentionally hampering a reasonable user experience is beneath you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Laughter on Water"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "The Fire Stick didn't work on two tvs so I ordered a replacement. Replacement didn't work either. I couldn't get past the Amazon logo/blank screen. I tried the stick on a small tv in a bedroom and I was able to get to the start screen. The remote wouldn't let me proceed (I used new batteries) so I gave up and will return everything tomorrow. Clearly this device isn't compatible with all tvs and it would have been nice to know before I wasted so much time. I'm very disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "A.
