[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was skeptical about purchasing this, but it has worked great so far.  Now I can get Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, youtube, etc. on my TV.  My only criticism is the remote.  It is pretty flimsy, I just hope it lasts....  It was also hard to figure out how to open it to put the batteries in (believe it or not, I found a \"how to\" video on youtube --obviously I am not the first who struggled with this).  Other than that, great value for the price!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

I am returning my chrome cast because of the fact of being a prime member this made sense . I had no idea how different they would be. Chrome cast setup took 3 hrs bc internet issues and so on.
