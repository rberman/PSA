[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I am enjoying our fire stick, but it does have some issues. At first I believed it was the Netflix app only, but I have issues with Hulu and YouTube. So far no issues with the Amazon shows and movies, but I have not used those as much as the other apps. Netflix continues to pause every few minutes sometimes, while other times I can watch for hours without a problem. I have had it completely crash twice - turning to a purple lined staticky screen, and had to reset the device. I did reinstall Netflix after a suggestion from the help forum but that has not fixed the issue. Lately Hulu has been randomly pausing as well, though no complete crashes. Netflix turned completely purple on me yesterday over the entire screen, but I could still hear voices talking. I had to turn the device off and restart it to fix it. I have purchased an extended (6') HDMI extender cable that I'm hoping will fix the issues if they are wifi related, but I'm not convinced that wifi signal is causing all of the crashing.In general though, when this is working, it's MUCH faster than my Smart TV downstairs. Navigation is easy and I like that it's very easy to sync all your Hulu, Netflix, etc accounts. The Youtube app is also much better than the one on my Smart TV. Very easy to scroll through your subscriptions. If it weren't always crashing I would absolutely give this 5 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MWhittaker"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works great.

I am so pleased with my results (it was my first time setting up anything electronic) that I have bragging rights with all my friends!  I was enjoying my shows within 10 minutes!

I have a Chromecast and actually prefer that.  I typically use my smartphone for Netflix and things like that and was looking forward to using the screen mirroring feature in order to display things from my phone on the TV.  The Mircast feature that the Fire Stick claims to handle that, hasn't worked for me.  Chromecast handles that feature much better.  Pretty disappointed!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
