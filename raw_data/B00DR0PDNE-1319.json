Small suggestion, try the app called video stream on google chrome.. I have tons of movies on my laptop (like anybody else i.n this days) and I can watch them on my chromecast around the house.. It's super worth it.. So many friendly apps coming already for it.. For movies, music, music videos, and simply streaming everything..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jose R.
