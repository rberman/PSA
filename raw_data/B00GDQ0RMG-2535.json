I own 2 now.  The wireless reception is excellent.  I actually have one installed on my new  Sharp 70\" Aquos Smart TV because the TV only gets 2 bars on the wifi causing it to buffer a lot on Pandora.  Firestick never skips, freezes, or buffers. It is redicules that I have to install a firestick on a smart TV.  It also has many more apps preloaded on it than the smart TV.  For $39 it is a great buy,  and I could have saved at least couple hundred dollars buying a 'dumb' TV using the Firestick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karl Maurer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Vincent N.
