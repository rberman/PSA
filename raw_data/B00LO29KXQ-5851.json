It seems more reliable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "A"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I used to use an XBOX 360 for my streaming, but I sold it.  I bought 2 of these sticks (one for a gift) when they were on first on sale for $20.  What a deal!!!  Even at $40 it's only $5 more than the competition's stick... and I'm pretty sure this one is much better.So far all I've used it for is NetFlix and Amazon Prime video.  I do intend to use it for some other stuff too... mostly music streaming.  Unfortunately, my music service of choice, Slacker, isn't available.  Hopefully it will be soon.  No intention of doing any gaming but I might check it out if I get bored.Let's break it down:Pros:Inexpensive and totally worth it even at $40Great quality in NetFlix and Amazon videoResponsive remote.  RF so it works without line of sight.  Good size.  Easy to use without looking.All necessary hardware included.Pretty nice packaging.  Not a blister pack.No hiccups or stuttering playing videoCons:You should probably use the included power adapter instead of trying to use a USB output on the TVFire stick was pre-setup with my account.  This is a problem because I plan on giving one as a gift.An update was immediately required.  This took about 10-15 minutes.No power button.  You have to navigate to the settings menu to put in sleep mode.Limited apps but most of what you expectNo wired network support (but you already knew that)The first time it starts up it asks you to connect to your wireless network, then it starts updating.  You cannot stop or skip.After the update completes, you may be re-requested to setup your wireless network, but by the time I noticed and got the remote, it managed to remember the settings.  Then you will have to adjust the overscan (which is set to no overscan by default, which is what you expect on HDMI).  Next the first time tutorial video starts.  This goes over the basics of how to use the device.  After that, you're off to the races.Using NetFlix for the first time requires downloading the app.  No big deal but it's not built in.  It looks like I can also move video from my phone to the Amazon Fire TV Stick and use it for streaming with my iPhone.  I haven't tested this feature yet.All I was looking for was a basic and easy to use way to watch Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix on my TV.  This thing delivers absolutely perfectly.  I'll try to update this review again later after using more of the capabilities and features.  If it doesn't do anything more than it does now, I think it is more than adequate, and only the addition of Slacker would make the product complete for my purposes.I don't know why you haven't bought one of these yet.

Just hooked it up to the back of the tv and away I went. It is wonderful to be able to connect to movies, apps, games, even photos right on my tv.

Easy to set-up and works very well.  But to really enjoy it, you should be a \"prime member.\"  We are so it meets our needs just fine.
