Docking it one star for the terribly designed remote- you shouldn't have to search the internet and cut yourself on an xacto knife to get the batteries in!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "nyshoelover"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This device is so frustrating!  Too many problems with it keeping connected or pausing during streaming and it always happens at the most inopportune time.  I have a high end performance wireless router so that is not the problem.  My IPad never has any issues using the same wireless router.  I finally pulled the Fire Stick and went back to using a Wii game controller and it never loses connections.  I waited too long fiddling with the Fire Stick and can\u2019t return it.  I wasted $39 on the Fire Stick and caused myself a lot of frustration.  Do not recommend this streaming device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "kevin kaiser"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love how it saves your favorite shows and knows right where you left off watching them.
