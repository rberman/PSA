[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I would give five stars for this totally awesome device, but I have one complaint (that I hope will be remedied soon) I NEED HBO NOW! :)I can't use HBO Go, unfortunately because I don't have a subscription and was surprised to that HBO Now is not supported by this device. Otherwise this has been one of the best purchases I ever made. I've had it for a few months now and the quality is amazing. The steaming is fast and efficient and it was soooo easy to set up and use. AND saved me $50 on my cable bill plus the Prime membership, while not required, is worth every penny. Again, love, love, love this product but PLEASE hurry up with the HBO Now....Game of Thrones is on, man! lol :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisa Fleener"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "free stick with the purchase of sling tv :) nices and hd tv !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "andy a"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Guest room alternative to cable", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gr8day"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it... and customer support is wonderful", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karen Jaramillo"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "We love it only wish it had HG TV station.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "william curtis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great little gadget.
