We don't have cable and don't want to have to pay for it so Fire TV supplements that void. If you have Amazon Prime it is even more worth it as there are a ton of free shows you wouldn't have access to if you didn't have Prime. Plus the added benefit of most of the items you purchase come with free shipping and within two days. This makes it all well worth it. We now get to catch up with the shows we didn't have access to before and heard so much about, but we don't have to pay the monthly fees associated with cable. Sure not all of the shows are free, but when you compare the limitations of bunny ears to the benefits of Amazon Fire TV then you can see why I gave it 5 stars. Amazon did a great job with the packaging as well making sure it was professional and didn't come apart during shipment. I was surprised how small but powerful the device actually is as well. Great job Amazon and keep the quality going in this direction. Haven't had an issue yet and hasn't had to buffer once!!!! Plus instead of paying a monthly cable bill you only pay 99 bucks one time and its yours!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Chels"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "MUCH, Much better than Roku - glad I bought it, and would buy it again (no, I DON'T work for Amazon or write reviews for them).  It's very simple to use, very easy to access tons of videos, movies, TV, music, etc.  Only issue is a lot of the \"current\" ones are $1 more than Roku's stuff (Vudu, other vendors than Amazon's current movies) - but, Amazon Prime has a good library, as well.  The simplicity of it makes up for the extra cost (plus having all the Prime stuff).  Very reliable, very easy to use, good variety - all around, it's hard to deny it's a better product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

The voice search is remarkable and accurate.Everything else is middling quality at best. I specifically bought the Fire TV because I wanted to replace my Chromecast with something that could play Prime Instant Video, but also still be a DIAL target for Youtube and Netflix. This functionality is almost completely broken on the Fire TV, despite there being no technical barriers to this working just fine. I was eventually able to make YouTube work by individually pairing devices to it, but Netflix never worked right and I gave up trying after a few hours.I understand Amazon is competing with Google and Netflix, but this is extremely frustrating. I am returning the Fire TV and going back to using a Chromecast, with my PS3 for Prime Instant Video. The Fire TV is just too frustrating. I am extremely disappointed and I expect better from Amazon; this product does not live up to the quality I expect from them.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Formica \"fourmica\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This product is very nice and fast and was very easy to install.
