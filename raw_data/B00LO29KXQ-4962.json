Its just as fast as my Roku 3 and very easy to set up. they even play a little tutorial video when you first plug it in.

I really had no idea what to expect as this was a gift my husband wanted. He loves it and I have to say that I do to. I ordered Amazon Prime to go along with it and it appears that many of the movies and TV shows are included only with Prime, so I'm happy I went ahead and purchased it. We are still exploring all the Fire Stick has to offer, but so far are very happy with the purchase and the product. We are actually going to order one for my in-laws.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This device is amazing. Far exceeds my expectations. Extremely easy to install & very user friendly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sky-Mike"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This not only met my expectations, but exceeded them. It was easy to set up, and has way more features than I realized, such as YouTube support and my favorite local radio stations. If I could just find a way to watch live TV broadcasts using it, I'd abandon my digital antenna and TiVo.The user interface for navigating my watchlist is a bit clunky, and the Fire TV Stick has lost its network connection a few times (when our WiFi and internet connection are just fine). But I'll chalk those up to \"new product\" issues, and assume things will improve over time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Todd Bradley"}]
