I've had to reset it, unplug it, try the power adapter, try the usb, try the hdmi extender, monkeyed with my router settings, even tried a different wireless network all only resulting in it MAYBE working for an hour at best and most times it still won't connect at all. The chromecast isn't far from the router so it's not a distance issue. I hate this thing and really need to look into returning it.

After looking for a backup plan for the inevitable day that the Wii dies I read up on Chromecast.  After receiving it in the mail we started using the item.  First thing I loved over the Wii streaming, the HD quality of the shows.  You can stream from your cell phone or tablet, sometimes we even use our home PC.  You can stream (slower speed) google chromed websites from your PC.  My wife hadn't planed to ever use it, but says she has used it at least once a day ever since we got it.Pros: HD quality, easy to useCons: If you have an older phone that cannot update to newer firmware (mine is an older phone that cannot update past gingerbread) you may be able to run the Hulu+ app on your phone, but it is a version of that app that cannot stream to chromecast.  Guess it might be time for a new phone.Con:  If you have kids that want to control what you are watching, we find it easier to have it on the Wii, I don't need chocolate and jelly all over my phone (my 5 year old taught himself how to stream from the PC though)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Son of Archness"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "When I first got my Chromecast it was not very stable with the wifi connection, however after moving the CHromecast to an MHL HDMI port on my tv it works great and never drops a connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "P.
