But turned out it did the same thing as the other, would not connect even though settings menu said I had good signal, and also that all my other wifi systems were working well.  .  It was my router that was the problem, was not powerful enough for the Amazon stick.  Now works great with upgraded router.  Difficult for me to keep up with technology, stuff becomes obsolete in year or two, my previous router was only two years old.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "N B."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy, straightforward set up and results.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "freckles gardener"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was the simplest install I have ever done!

It's great! However, I am a bit upset because movies I want to watch, even older movies are only available for rent! There are not really very many movies I want to watch on Prime that are free. Most have to be rented. Therefore, Prime isn't all that great as far as free movies are concerned. It's a good thing I get free shipping on most of my orders as long as it is Prime!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very easy to install and use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul D.
