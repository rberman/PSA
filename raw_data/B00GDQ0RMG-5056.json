Lots of apps and media to choose from. However 5 GHZ band support is weak. It can only see my router's 5 GHZ SSID if the channel frequency is fixed (Not auto). Search Google and you will see other people have this problem too. Otherwise the Fire Stick will only see 2.4 GHZ SSIDs. Not sure if it is hardware or software issue, but hopefully Amazon can fix it in software updates (which is automatic).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Y.
