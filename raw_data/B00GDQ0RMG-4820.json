[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's a great streaming stick with all the services you would expect. The specs are top notch, and the voice control via the Fire TV app is handy, if not a bit gimmicky. I found the user interface to be cumbersome and filled to the brim with useless offers and suggestions. Coming from Roku boxes, Fire TV is a navigational nightmare. With Roku, I can choose what clutters up by screen.TL;DR... I give 3 stars for performance. This thing is built to stream! But I minus 2 stars for bloat and navigation.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Les McGowan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this thing!

Amazon's Fire TV Stick is my favorite add-on to my television since the blu ray player.Not only does this product let you take advantage of your Prime subscription content, it also let's you expand beyond with apps and screen mirroring functionalities. My favorite part about the Fire Stick is that I have had great streaming experiences with this product. I was streaming Amazon Prime through my Nintendo Wii, but the playback lagged at times and was grainy beyond a bad YouTube resolution. The Fire TV Stick seems to have figured out how to juice my slow network speed to deliver incredible content.A final word- I actually bought another one of these for another room in my house... that is how much I like this device.If you are one the fence, I say go for it. You will not be disappointed nor out of much money at all.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kyle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "snicklefritz"}]
