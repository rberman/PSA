There aren't many apps to download either. But its a good product. I returned it and go the Roku for the TWC app. And is has more apps to choose from.

It makes it a little less portable than without needing it.  My biggest issue is that it buffers alot.  I have both units on the same wifi network and the box does not buffer as badly.  The stick does it all the time and it is 10ft from the router.  It is honestly so so because of that.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Graham Mingst"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sandyh"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "easy to figure out.  strong wifi signal.  good design", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian Vigil"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was afraid I wouldn't be able to figure out how to connect everything.
