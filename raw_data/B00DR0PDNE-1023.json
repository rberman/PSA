I love this thing! no cables to deal with :).  I use two apps mainly which are Netflix and BubbleUPNP.  BubbleUPNP lets you play all your video's you have stored on a computer or NAS.  It plays MP4/M4V without issue (which is the standard these days). My wife is Chinese so I wish they would have more Chinese programming out there.  More apps are always arriving so I'm sure some will pop up one day.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works very well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ruben"}]
