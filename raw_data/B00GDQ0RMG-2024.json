Setting it up took some work, it loses the internet signal frequently despite being very close to the router.  The HDMI stick is rather long so if your tv is mounted on the wall it may take some finesse and rearranging.  The power adapter to the stick is very short so if your tv is mounted on he wall you need to figure out a different power option. (Extension cord? Ugly.)  I'm working on a solution to that now :( Variety of shows is pretty good but the remote is not the greatest, especially for searching. I may need to suck it up and buy the voice remote :(", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dragonfly3085"}]
