Humphrey"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I loved this at first. The remote and menu is pretty intuitive. It was easy to set up and worked right out of the box. The two main problems I have are with hulu and HBOGO. Each service points the blame at the other person so not sure who's at fault but hulu is incredibly laggy. Like it's constantly buffering. After the ads (which play seemlessly) the audio will start with a blank screen. In my area we only have comcast for cable so for some reason they dont have an agreement with firestick and I can't stream my HBO with the firestick. I don't have problems with any connectivity with any wireless devices other than this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shady OGrady"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works perfectly, just need to make sure you have a strong wifi signal", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Dont like it at all!
