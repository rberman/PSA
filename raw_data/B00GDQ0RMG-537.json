As I read through the comparison chart on this web page, several things stand out: 1) The Amazon device is better for total memory, wireless capability, and programming, especially games; 2) Chromecast has the edge in price. My personal experience with the devices gives me these nuggets: 1) The Chromecast consistently works better than the Fire TV Stick, providing HD quality without sluggishness or choppiness or interrupted streaming, whereas the Fire TV Stick is often choppy or unable to continue streaming, and is consistently blurrier onscreen. 2) The Amazon TV Stick has a better, more dynamic slideshow when in standby, but it shuts down after maybe a half hour of running, whereas the Chromecast runs all day and offers more source options, such as satellite imagery from NASA along with my personal photos in the mix. 3) Amazon should not put their voice search and dedicated game controller into the comparison chart above because you can't get those with the $39 device; it's an unfair point of comparison. Having them in the chart should force Amazon to add the cost of those devices to the Fire TV Stick price: currently $28 for the voice search remote and $40 for the dedicated game controller-- GRAND TOTAL = $107. The Amazon Fire TV Stick is a more or less satisfactory streaming device for Amazon Prime and has lots of whistles and bells, some more functional than others. But, for me, the Chromecast is my preferred go-to device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Worked like a charm on my TV and I LOVE IT!
