Very cool feature and as such its being advertised.Tried it out, it doesn't work with any of the windows devices. Looking on the web, searching twitter it seems I am not the only one who expected to get it and never did.Amazon advertisement is misleading - just don't buy this if this feature is important to you.Beyond that, tried the device on two TV's with only half success- I guess this is also a standard issue? \ud83d\ude09", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Bird \"Not sure what I was thinking\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I enjoy how many things are on the fire sick.
