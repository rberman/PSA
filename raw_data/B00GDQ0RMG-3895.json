It's so easy to use, my 4 year old used it the most. We recently took it on our road trip and it connected just fine with the hotels wifi. It is so much faster and better than our chrome cast. We have never had a problem with it continually loading and buffering like we do with the chrome cast. I would recommend it for everyone.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "W.

I purchased this with Sling TV service and the whole experience is really good with Fire TV - watching channels like ESPN, HGTV, etc. streaming smoothly in high definition, feels just like cable. On my PC Sling TV did not work quite so smoothly. What I loved most though is the ability to play Amazon Prime music in the background and view slideshow of my photos from Amazon Cloud Storage (which is free for photos to boot). Really nice!Edit 2/28: Unfortunately the screen mirroring on Fire TV stick does not work with Windows 8.1 nor Windows Phone. Unfortunate! It would have been really good.

Have found that you do not want to leave it plugged in to power when not in use.  The stick seems to get warm.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ken Reichert"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works well,  some glitching. I only have Internet,  no cable TV. Using Amazon Prime makes it even better, because it increases your choices and speed.  I am the luckiest mother.  My sweet son sent a huge TV and the Fire Stick as a surprise.  Quick, simple set up and I was enjoying it within minutes.My yearly cost for cable and Internet would surely add up much more, even counting his outlay for the TV and Fire Stick.Thanks,  Mario", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
