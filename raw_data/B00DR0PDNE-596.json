Come to find out that most hotel WiFi won't support this device in doing that. After finding that out, and being grumpy about it, I brought it home and plugged it into my own TV to set it up. Where I have devices at home to watch Netflix on I didn't have a way to watch My Google Play purchases so that's what I primarily use this for. With my phone, the Note 3, I'm still able to use my phone while it's streaming and it doesn't appear on the TV. Overall I'm still happy with the purchase, just not happy I can't use it while traveling.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jill W"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product, 100% recommended.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tyrone"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Every bit worth the money.
