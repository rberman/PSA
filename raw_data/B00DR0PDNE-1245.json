I also own a Roku 2.When I first got this, it was the best way for me to play YouTube videos. Now that Roku has a YouTube channel, I haven't used my Chromecast in months.If you already have a media player, the only thing that I would recommend using a Chromecast for is screen mirroring. I can't speak to how well it works now, but it used to be terrible at streaming Chrome windows (when it was in beta, so I'm cutting it slack there). I'm sure other reviewer's have a better idea of how it is now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nate H"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My Chromecast is set up in our bedroom, and it's been awesome for us.We're able to stream not only Netflix, but DLNA content from our home network to our television without any hassle.
