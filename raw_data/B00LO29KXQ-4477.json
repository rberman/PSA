However, I recently reconnected it and did a manual update, and the problem is not solved.  I successfully watched a Netflix video, but, when I came back the next day, the device could not access our network.

Admittedly I use this for a limited set of features - primarily as a client for a Plex server and also occasionally for the Amazon TV - but I can say that it excels at those two things. It replaced an older Google TV box from Sony (NSZ-GS8) and it is significantly faster when loading media from Plex.There seem to be no problems with the wireless connection. The interface is smooth. App run smoothly.Overall, I'm very impressed!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard S."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Seems to be great but from time to time it has difficulty connecting but after a few tries it eventually connects", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "tonyallen007"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is super cool!!
