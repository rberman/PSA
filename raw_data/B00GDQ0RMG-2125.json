But suddenly it stopped working.  There is nothing wrong with my NetFlix account; it works perfectly on this computer as well as on our Smart TV.I can get to NetFlix, it shows a menu of shows but when I select a show I get the same message \"we are currently experiencing problems with this program.  Try back later.\"That is the message that comes up with every show I try.  I performed a test which showed all the NetFlix servers to be working as well as the network connection being at full strength.I have unplugged everything to try to see if it would reboot but nothing changed.  This was two days ago and I am still not able to access NetFlix through this Fire Stick which is really too bad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Midnight Dancer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "When the Fire Stick works, it is great.  However, I have it connected to the tv in my bedroom, which is maybe 40-50 from our internet router.  Whenever I try to use the Fire Stick it is constantly buffering--even though it says my wifi strength is \"very good.\"  Also, I can easily watch netflix, or stream music in my room via my laptop, so I am not entirely sure where the disconnection is happening, but it is extremely frustrating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Caitlin McNulty"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Arrived on time and worked as stated.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "William Wallace"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Fantastic device that we use in the bedroom tv and on the road.
