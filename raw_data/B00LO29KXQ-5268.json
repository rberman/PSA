[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "This device just does not cut it.  It's more frustrating than anything because I bought this so I could more easily stream from Amazon I really wanted to like it.  I have tried a lot of things and I really wanted it to work but it doesn't.  It clearly has networking issues.  There are a ton of complaints and failed troubleshooting processes out there but from what I have seen others have not been able to get this thing to work well either.  All other devices on my network work fine but the AFS starts stuttering or dropping  connection within an hour of starting.  When prompted to go to the network settings the only thing offered is Very Strong signal and  connected with problems.  Nothing else.  Does not say what the problem is.  Does not allow you to disconnect and reconnect from the network  only forget the network and then rejoin so you have to enter the password all over again and again the result is the same.  A connection for a while and then after it becomes connected with problems.  How does one do you diagnosis of the problem when it says it connects with a strong signal but nothing else.  Never had an issue like this with Chromecast and I have heard good things about Roku stick so I guess I will eventually get one of those.  {I would get another Chromecast but I want to stream amazon prime on this tv}.  The device is flawed.  I wish it was not to late to send back because I would in a heartbeat as it is now it will just go into the box of junk for recycling.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

There is a design flaw in the stick itself; it is too long. I have a 2 year old 42\" Samsung flatscreen. The molding on the back of the TV is con-caved at the location of the input jacks. Unfortunately the Fire Stick is too long to fit into that indentation. As such, I can't use it.I also have 2 Google ChromeCast adapters. They're great (just can't use Amazon Prime Video).", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "S.
