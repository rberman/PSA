My main reason for ordering it was to be able to watch Amazon Prime on TV instead of my iPad.The downside is the available apps. I went to Amazon and started to download apps after I had downloaded all I wanted on the Firestick. Every app I chose stated not applicable with Firestick. Why? If these are Amazon apps why would they not all be applicable? This is very disappointing. We are debating stopping Dish services and going to a receiver and maybe HD inside antenna for local channels. Due to the app problem, we will probably go with Apple or Roku and not Amazon Firestick. My daughter has Apple and they have numerous apps on their TV.  Also another aggravation on Firestick is the way they list the Apps. They are cluttered and on Netflix you have to keep scrolling to the side to find a program whereas on my Blu-Ray DVD there are categories and it is much easier to find a show.  Very disappointed in apps but not in the performance so far. Overall I would purchase just for Amazon Prime due to it's price but if they want it to be competitive Amazon needs to make many improvements.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "infoplease"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I bought this months ago and am just using it now because the remote to my Roku is missing. I have been screwing around with it for 2hrs having used 6 different wifi connections. It will not connect, it errors out and says it can't \"connect to Amazon\" every time. This is a cable internet connection, 4 different wifi hotspots from three different carriers and a fiber optic connection and nothing. I even went in and got the IP and gateway addresses and tried to do it manually, still wont connect.My Roku was up and working within 3 minutes. I wish I had not waited so long to use it so I could have returned it.

I have to unplug it just about daily. And it gets angry with Netflix.  But I love it, it helps me be a better couch potato.Edit 4/29/15: super horrible glichtyness.  It's just awful,  every few minutes it pauses whatever I'm watching on Prime,  it's a bit better on Netflix. So I'm not sure what the deal is. I'm not sure if fire tv would be better,  but I'm becoming super annoyed by this gadget.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Emily"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works great and great deal with prime", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Double D"}]
