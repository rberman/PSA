I have both Apple TV and Google Chromecast and I prefer the Fire TV Stick any day.  The Fire TV Stick is more user friendly, offering a better interface and menu than Chromecast and Apple TV.  With its impressive content offerings such as HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, Disney, streaming staples Netflix and Hulu Plus, and all of Amazon Prime media content, this tiny usb drive transforms any tv into a multimedia experience.
