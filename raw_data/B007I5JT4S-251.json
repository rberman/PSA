I do like having access to iTunes and all my music, because we have this device in our exercise room now, and we can call up every video and song in our library. That's handy. I wish it had a mini jack output instead of optical, because now we have to get audio from our TV instead of directly from the Apple TV. That means I can't use the Apple TV as an Airplay destination (the way I do with my Airport Express) unless I go to the room and turn on the TV first.When we used the Apple TV in our dining room, which was visible from the kitchen, It was nice to be able to watch True Detective on HBOGo, and I probably would have kept that going (along with other HBO shows), but we have a much different setup now, so the Apple TV gets less use. It comes down to it just not finding as necessary a place in our lives as other Apple products. It's okay to have, but I wouldn't truly miss it if it was gone. It needs a killer feature that makes it so unique that maybe I'd even add it to my living room TV (seems unlikely, though, given that I have a PS3, TiVo, and a Mac Mini hooked up to that, so plenty of bases are covered there). And, ultimately, I'm either streaming something off Amazon Prime or Netflix, or playing back time-shifted programming on the TiVo.Anyway, if you have limited Apple stuff, and no computer or other entertainment device hooked up to your TV, you may get a lot more use, especially if you like the provided content and that the TV is a satellite to your main TV, like in the bedroom. We gave my mother in law one for her bedroom, and after getting past that awkward new-gadget phase, she seems to be using it as much as the downstairs TV, for better or worse!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric Prescott \"Go vegan\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "very happy with apple tv", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Tina Boldt"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Compared to a Roku and probably Amazon Fire TV, this thing is an embarrassment to Apple. It is much slower in every respect.It offers much less program channels including omitting Amazon Prime which is a huge minus. Granted it has been around for a while, but I guess it has not improved much. Oh yea, it does physically \"look\" better than Roku. The only other good thing it has going for it is that you can mirror your ipad to the TV which is amazing in itself and is the only purpose it serves for me.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Kanaotto"}]
