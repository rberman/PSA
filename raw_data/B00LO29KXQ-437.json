[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I received a Fire TV Stick as a gift; I don't think I would buy one even for that one person who you don't like but feel like you have to buy a gift for anyway. The interface is annoying to use and this fact is compounded by the delay between input and cursor action. The app selection is very basic and is beat by Google and Roku's devices. The only way to get any kind of value is if you have Amazon Prime, but even then your selection is limited compared to Netflix. To top everything off, this thing will barely stay on. There are times where after turning the TV on, I have to wait upwards of an hour or more for it to decide to stop constantly restarting and stay on.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Adam Britt"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This little gadget is great! I am a Prime member and I also have Netflix. There is a ton of other programming that you can get as well. I wanted it for my bedroom tv so I could watch movies when I went to bed. It hooks up so easy, just plug it in and put the tv on the right source and you are going! Love it so far!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Checheetah A Courtney"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Firestick won't work anymore.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "joseph liquori"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Borders on worthless.

When the first one didn't make it to the house customer service tried to make me feel like they were doing me a favor by sending another one.

I am not tech wavy & it was easy for me to set up. We use it on our larger, not so smart, TV to access Netflix & Hulu. The sound is better than normal use of TV & saves having to buy a new TV.
