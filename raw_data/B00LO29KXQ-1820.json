[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I ordered the Fire Stick not knowing what to expect but since I subscribed to a few of the apps/services supported thought I'd give it a try. Bottom line it arrived and after we activated it it worked Great, even easier than I had hoped for. Even a better a better deal if your a Prime member.... Not only does it have a lot of content to watch but games for my children too, I may have to invest in the controller.... I may be ditching my expensive cable package and just get Internet from my provider.Fire Stick has something for everyone & easy to use, Highly Recommended.....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

And why would you down load from kindle fire to the fire stick  when  the fire stick already in the TV . It does the same exact thing . I think it is amazing amazon prime is free sometimes, and when you go back its $1.99 or higher for the same TV shows you started watching for free. Give me Netflix  over amazon any day. I will not renew when year  ends but the fire stick does work .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "roger"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This item has exceeded my expectations & family , very easy to setup and used.
