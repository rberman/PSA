I purchased one for my sister and mother as birthday gifts and my mother being not technically savvy  she clicked away trying to figure out how it works and ran up over $100 in charges. To top it off I ordered these as GIFTS, so why the hell are they linked to my account?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "loosewill"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Beware!Do not get fooled by the Fire Stick description given by Amazon.The device is NOT as described.1.Doesn't work with iOS.2.
