However, there are several reasons we are hating it:1. PERFORMANCE is inconsistent and there have been several instances where we've had to restart it. The remote some times doesn't even work. Today it had crazy, erractic behavior. Press a button on the remote and it would move 50 spaces on the menu. Possessed. I've just had to plug and unplug again. Since we've been using Apple TV for years without issue we are experienced with this type of device. The Fire Stick HAS BUGS that need to be worked out. Beware!2. PARENTAL CONTROLS - this is a great feature in theory but their execution is subpar. If you set the parent control it requires a password be entered before watching ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. This is annoying. It would make sense to require the password for things like: a)shows with anything higher than a G rating, b)purchases. All I want is for kids to be able to scroll and select a kid's show on their own without me needing to come into the room and enter the password. I want their content limited to them and don't want them to be able to buy anything. Netflix does a great job with this by having you set up profiles for each user. Amazon get with the program!If Amazon fixes the bugs to improve performance and adds logical parental controls it'll be great. So far it is a disappointment and currently is unusable due to technical issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "PrincessButtercup"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Great for Prime member's features, but VERY limited on other apps.  Apple TV has many more features for options.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeff B."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Everyone else has written long detailed explanations of all the wonders of this stick. So I will keep it short and simple. I own an xbox, and the xbox one. I also have a ps3, roku, bluray with apps, etc. I hate wasting so much power on larger devices to stream, so I bought this. It blows the Roku interface out of the water and has become my preferred streaming device. Amazon has done a nice job on it. Wish search included apps like Roku does but thats it. I love this thing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "EvilNCarnate"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome little device. I have Chromecast and Fire TV already but couldn't resist the early prime price. This is perfect for an Amazon Prime member. I have it in a bedroom on a 32 inch TV and it works perfect. The UI is a little slower to respond than my Fire TV but it's still fairly smooth. Great product. Only negative is it has no app that will play my UV collection in HD. Flixster only plays SD and there is no Vudu app yet. I still dream of having one device that allows Netflix, Google Movies/Music, HD UV, and Amazon Instant because I run out of HDMI plugs!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CHUMP"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it! This device just replaced a full sized media center PC with XBMC. Setup was a snap, took all of 2 minutes. is currently being powered by USB on back of my TV (Sony Bravia), so for me this is a self-contained unit. Fast interface. Sideloading apps took some figuring out, but once I did, it was pretty easy. Sideloaded android version of XBMC, and it works great. Haven't messed with all the features, so I can't really say I've had any issues. But so far the experience is far exceeding my expectations. Can't say enough. If you're on the fence, don't hesitate.

My router is literally just on the other side of the tv and every single time I turn the tv on it asks for my password and then will not even log in.
