[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "The biggest problem I have had with this is watching movies.  It seems to buffer quite a bit when watching movies with it.  I watched a movie recently on the stick and it was buffering so much that we could not watch it.  Waited till the next day, loaded it on my kindle fire and watched it on the t.v. through the stick.
