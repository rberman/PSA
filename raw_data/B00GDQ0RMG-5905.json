The interface is cumbersome. It surprisingly feels slow in many apps. Youtube is almost unusable.Otherwise I love it and prefer it over my PS4 as it has much more content.

We have about a 2 year old LG 42\" HDTV in our master bedroom, but it's not a smart TV. We're spoiled because our den set is a smart TV. Installed the Fire Stick, & almost at once we now have 2 smart TV's. I almost gave up on it but I waited a few hours after installing it, came back to it, & there it was. Netflix, Amazon Prime, & everything else. When I first installed it , it kept going in & out of pairing with my WiFi. Kept saying loss of signal, but then it said signal was very good. Forget Netflix, it wouldn't let me begin to sign in to my account. I shut the set off & came back to it in about 3 hours. Turned it on again, changed the input to Fire Stick, & like I never had trouble, everything worked flawlessly. Netflix sign in, Amazon Prime movies, etc. For me it's great, judge for yourself.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stevie S"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have an older projection tv and it works great! sooooo glad I got it....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike Haemmerle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The hardest part of the setup was opening the remote to insert the batteries :).
