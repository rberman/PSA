It was very easy to install.  The hardest part was moving the chest out from the wall so I could get to the outlet.  I was watching a movie in no time at all.I am having trouble with the music part of it thru Prime but I have not really taking time to figure it out.  I did buy a user Guide for it and I'm sure I will get it going with that.  I just haven't had time to do that yet.  Life calls.I wish I had found it when it was on sale for Christmas.And I'm thinking it would be better to have the voice remote that goes with it but it was another 29.99.  I think it would be easier to find movies you want to watch.  Amazon needs to rethink their set up for movies and their library for kindle prime lending.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jean D \"pipmaxjas\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use - Reliable download speed - some movies listed as free are previews only though (\"Ascension\")", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Lenzerini \"LancezFun\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing in every possible way.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "BriaHofland"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Set-up took less than 5 minutes......great add on to my television at an awesome price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Veronica Richards"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works as advertised, great to travel with in hotels with internet and a flat screen!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Stephen Gilman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy setup and simple to use, it is a great addition to our home entertainment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "shoe9"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Josh"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it no longer need cable or HBO", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "julie chang"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "cool item no buffering and a lot of apps can be added", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "FRAN S."}]
