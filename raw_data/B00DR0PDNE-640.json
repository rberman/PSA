Send a stupid amount of things natively to your TV from your computer or phone with literally two taps. It's automatically detected by apps that support it. If what you want to watch doesn't support the Chromecast, the screencast features in the Chrome desktop browser and the Android app let you cast browser tabs or your phone's screen to the TV with audio. Works fantastically; I've even screencast HD video from my /phone/ with minimal artifacts.Setup is a breeze. Plugs into an HDMI slot on the TV and takes power from its power supply through a mini USB port.Best $35 I ever dropped.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William Pyburn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Emad Abuhamoud"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "doesn't work with iOS.
