Most site that I visit does not support it, especially chinese sites.

I purchased this due to the low price point and thought it would save me from transferring downloaded items to a flash drive to watch.  Since it came with free netflix time...it was basically free.Since you can't control playback...you have to go back and forth to your computer constantly to pause of fast forward or whatever.  So you won't want to get this if your computer is in another room.  You can ONLY use certain file types with this.  It won't work with things like VLC player so make sure the file types you have will play n chrome.  (Drag and drop them into the browser). I believe .avi is the file type that doesn't work with this.  It's one of the two popular file types...I can't remember since it has been so long since I've bothered using this.  Far easier to just load a flash drive with a bunch of stuff.Really just a waste.  Get a roku if you need to play netflix on your tv...that's way more convenient.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "MaiLau"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I use this as an alternative to hooking up my PC to my TV via HDMI. It is nice to immediately have the option to use Netflix on my non-smart TV. Only issue is sometimes it is hard to get the phone to recognize the device is present. It doesn't work with many apps at the moment, but hopefully there will be updates in the future.

The only downfall is that if I forget to play a movie, the Chromecast home screen creates screen burning.
