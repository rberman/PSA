It is the ONLY way I can watch a few things - like HBO!  I also have a roku and a sony network media gadget in another location.If you have one of these, or are considering one - also get PlayOn. It works seamlessly with it, and it provides a very convenient way to locate and play almost ALL of the videos on the internet.Cut the cord - get a decent internet link and you are good. A somewhat speedy PC works also - mine is fast enough - but it slows a bit on some transcoding. PlayOn has a recommendation on their web site. And it doesn't have to be a pricey PC - just one with a FAST processor. That is especially true for the HD streaming.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carl Scheider \"Carl Scheider\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "it works fine, but sorry , not serve as a hdmi cable where you can see everything that I have on the screen of my device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alejandro Leit\u00f3n"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very good quality built I definitly recommended", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ignacio Costas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very cool device and does exactly what I want it to do.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steve"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect and great value...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LEIGH ANN GRIFFIN"}]
