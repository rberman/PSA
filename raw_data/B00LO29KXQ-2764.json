Wow.. super simple to install and yes, you have to plug it into an outlet but no biggie as it was easy enough to hide the cord.The stick came pre-programmed with my amazon info so it was just plug and input my wireless code and I was up and watching a movie in no time.The games look like fun so might buy the game controller as well.I have not downloaded the app onto my phone yet but looks easy enough to do.This is a super simple device that anyone can install and the price is right.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Todd"}]
