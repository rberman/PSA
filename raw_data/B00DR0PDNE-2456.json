I bought this just to add streaming in some areas of my house and also to compare to Roku. Even though it's lacking of channels but still ok because i normally watching Netflix and YouTube and it got on it. Shipping is fast because the seller is Amazon and it's the cheapest offer in Amazon online shops.Recommendable for watching streaming videos.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ARL"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "works great and really convenient...

I really like the concept of a streaming device that plugs right into the TV like this instead of being a box in the entertainment center. The device is a lot of fun if you want to watch YouTube or Netflix but it doesn't meet some of my other hopes. I am on the lookout for a single device solution. We have a Roku and that has almost everything we want to stream but doesn't do iTunes. We have an Apple TV and that has many streaming features but doesn't have Amazon Prime. Now we have the Chromecast and it doesn't have iTunes OR Amazon (and streaming Amazon through the browser requires the removal of Silverlight and then the video lags frequently). Amazon and iTunes are not likely to show up any time soon either - since Google has their own competing service. But overall, it works as well as any of the other streaming devices we have and the decision to purchase this device or one of the other competitors really comes down to which service you prefer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Google Chromecast arrived in perfect condition.

For example, widescreen videos are distorted to fit a standard TV (maybe not a problem on an HD set).  Had to purchase an HDMI to RCA converter since my older TV does not have HDMI, but it works fine.  The colors may be a bit distorted.  On the movies I have viewed so far, the color on the PC is blue-tinted but on the TV the colors are somewhat green-tinted.  (The TV actually looks more natural; don't know which is the \"true\" color.)  Documentation is non-existent, but there are some good references on Amazon.  (Interesting:  setup using Chrome failed, could not find my network, but setup using IE worked first time - go figure.)
