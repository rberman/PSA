Portable and responsive.The TV USB, at least mine, causes it to response noticeably slower. Using the wall plug gives it speed.Allcast is compatible, via my Note 3, which was a major selling point for me.The streaming is great, though I suspect it\u2019s coming  in at 720 but it doesn\u2019t make that large of difference for me.I\u2019m glad with this purchase. The Chromecast gives me the ability cast a chrome tab to it. I wish the TV stick could do this but its ability to cast from my Note 3 compensates. I\u2019ll keep the Chromecast but I mostly use the Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul S."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We have now purchased three of these.

Side-loads XBMC (Kodi) flawlessly, and appears to work just as well as the (far more expensive) original FireTV.  The remote is missing the voice recognition functionality of its big brother, but is otherwise fantastic.  I played with the remote control app a bit, and it works exactly as advertised, and setup is a breeze.
