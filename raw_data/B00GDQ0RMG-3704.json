We travel a lot and it is so easy to take with us to hotels or other people's houses when we need to catch up on our shows. We elected not to have cable, but have bought into Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus. This is a convenient way to access these and other apps and services. Highly recommend, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "brandi \"Brandi J Roberts\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "My Internet speed was too slow to view more than 1-2 seconds.

It isn't HD, and doesn't have an HDMI cable, so I had to buy a little adapter that turns HDMI into A/V Cables from Amazon.
