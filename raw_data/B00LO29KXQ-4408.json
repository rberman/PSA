More documentary, history and current TV shows would be wonderful.  Also I was curious about the range of the stick.  My bedroom is on the other side of my living room wall where the wireless router is located.  I find I have to turn my bedroom TV  and pull the router closer in order to get consistent connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Linda R.

I discovered what X-ray was when I checked the time on my Fire Phone or my Fire HD 7. X-ray was showing trivia and identifying the performers scene-by-scene. This was well worth the cost and I still plan to purchase the DVDs when they are available. I am a big fan of The Walking Dead, but there is so much more to watch using my Fire TV Stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marta R. \"Seans Mom\""}]
