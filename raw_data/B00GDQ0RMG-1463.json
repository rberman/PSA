I owner every little streaming device and once I got my Fire Tv Stick I haven't even messed with the other products. This is better than Roku, Google chromecast and Apple Tv. It's so much more versatile than the rest. I wish the remote had a \"fine me\" function. It's hard to keep track of. The IOS remote app works well. I'm going to order another one in the next few days.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Asher B."}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Very poor compatibility with outside controllers. PS4 controllers and many other modern wireless controllers will not work on here. Hours on support gave me absolutely no help. 360 and PS3 controllers \"MAY\" work on this, depending on the model. My PS3 controller will not work without flashing the system and installing extra software. There was nothing that explained this peripheral difference between the TV Stick and Amazon Fire TV.If you are not looking for something for gaming on, this is okay. Roku runs deals often that put them in line with the TV stick, this really is not a great option for gaming, and the start menu is really clunky for non-amazon viewing. The Hulu port to the stick was awfully done, and the reviews on the Amazon store show it. This was a half-finished, poor clone of something that should not have been given a budget model. Roku has been able to do it better for less.Amazon Fire Support: Completely useless overseas \"yes sir i am complete understand and empathy sir\" kind of support. After four reps asked me \"did you try turning it off and back on?\", I asked for a supervisor who was just as useless at helping me fix the problems that arose. The support for the Amazon Fire products are outsourced, uncaring, and NOT the same, lovable staff that you will get for a usual Amazon customer service experience, and that is very disappointing.Overall: If you absolutely can't upgrade to a Roku for $10 more, this TV Stick is a BARELY okay option for TV lovers. The lack of true modern controller functionality is a kick in the pants. Amazon wants you to buy their first-party controller, or the Fire TV box for optimum compatibility. The Hulu port skips and crashes, the front menu can be confusing to navigate, so confusing that they force you to watch several tutorials before you can start your TV Stick, and even then it doesn't help you figure out where you can properly download apps, forcing you to use the search bar for absolutely everything you do. You're better off buying Roku, or saving up for the Fire TV box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brandon McDonald"}]
