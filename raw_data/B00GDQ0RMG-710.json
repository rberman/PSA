I loved my Ruko, but it seemed to be lagging more and more.  My parents have the Fire TV box and it was amazing, so I wanted to give the stick a try.  So far it has been wonderful.  I have taken it on vacation and used it during a rainy day.  The picture is crisp and the operating platform is smooth.  No problems with lag on the device itself, but you want to make sure your internet connection is strong.  I would definitely recommend it for someone trying to cut the cable cord (sling is available, but I do not have an account) and people who would like something small for travel.  I can't wait to try some of the games on the stick, but I haven't gotten around to downloading any yet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Freezes up at any chance.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "univu2"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!
