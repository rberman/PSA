[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I cannot emphasize enough how much I love the fire t.v. stick. I used to hook my kindle to my television with an hdmi cord to watch content on my television. I didn't realize what a hassle that was until I could watch all the same content from the couch while browsing with a remote control. The picture and sound quality are much better than I get on the hd channels through my cable. In addition to being able to watch movies and t.v. shows, I love that Pandora is featured.It is incredibly easy to install.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jsins \"jsins\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Yay, another relatively inexpensive dongle.

This fireTV stick is the absolute dog's danglies.  Fast with great UI.  Love having a remote, because a remote never spontaneously forgets that it's controlling what you watch on the TV (YEAH I SAID IT, CHROMECAST).My girlfriend has one of those new Roku cubes, and while nice enough, doesn't stack up in my opinion.I would happily pay 39 for this all day long.

In less than 5 minutes I was watching Amazon Prime videos and that included plugging the TV and the Fire Stick in. It comes pre configured with the family Amazon account information already entered. A quick download and I was logged into my Netflix account. I installed parental controls and adjusted the account settings so my grandson can't do any in-app purchasing.The user interface of the Fire TV Stick is clean and intuitive and the remote clutter free, unlike my new TV who's remove has about a thousand buttons.If you are using a \"dumb\" TV or are just not near a cable connection the Fire TV Stick is a great way to extend the TVs  usefulness in your household.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.
