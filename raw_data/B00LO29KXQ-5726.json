[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Pros: Cheap price! User friendly! Tons of content!Cons: The introduction video is long and annoying. There is no way to by pass it. One of the Apps I really was excited about was Twitch. However, I found out I can't search for specific channels. I am stuck with the channels they display.So I got this neat little black box on my door step today. I opened it up to find the TV stick. Excited!! I quickly opened the package and removed everything.Inside I found the remote control, the stick, two AAA amazon basic batteries, a usb plug and wall adapter (which I didn't use).I plugged my power supply directly into a open usb port on my TV. When the TV is off the stick is off.After powering it on and selecting my wireless router, I found my account was already attached which to me was fine. I know some people have issues with their account being already active on amazon devices. Some people reported devices being stolen in the mail.Alright so the system is up and running.. but oh wait.. issue number 1. You have to watch a boring video that tells you the capabilities of the streaming stick. Funny.. I knew all this. That is why I bought it. There is no way to opt out of this long and stupid video.Finally at the home screen. Everything is laid out pretty friendly for what you would expect. Easy to navigate and find the content you want. I personally only use it for Amazon, Twitch, and games. I haven't really gotten into the games yet, but was struck a blow finding out twitch has limited use.I am sure there will be plenty of updates from other users on the other content.All in all the set up was easy and the device is nice. For being assembled in china, it is a sturdy little item. I hope it has no failures and lasts a while. For the price I would rather have this than a roku stick. I wouldn't even compare this to the chromecast. This is far better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dice55"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it! I already had Chromecast but like this better. It has the remote which is nice and great features. You don't have to use a computer or tablet with it. Good format and easier for fast forward. Includes Amazon prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "butterfly"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is great, better than having to hookup a laptop for streaming. It doesn't have disconnection issues as does my Xbox when running an instant streaming provider. Nice deal for the price, plus prime is only 50 a year which makes it cheaper than Hulu or Netflix per month.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Josiah Hendricks"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "just what I wanted!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "laura nicholas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I would give it 0 stars if that was an option because it does not work at all.  It recognizes my wifi, but will not accept the wifi password.  Everything else I have manages to connect, including my computers, smart TVs, Kindle, Fire TV and my new Echo.  And the stick is not even 2 feet from the router.  This is very disappointing, especially since I bought another one to give as a gift.  Would hate to give a gift that does not work.Update ... I love Amazon tech support! I entered a ticket online and THEY called me immediately with all my account information available.  They were very pleasant, very helpful, very patient and very well trained (I am a corporate trainer so that is important to me).  Most importantly, they apologized for the issue.  I am currently dealing with Comcast on a tech issue and they NEVER apologize for ANYTHING! Within 15 minutes, the Amazon techs had my issue resolved with the utmost professionalism! Turned out to be a simple fix.  The tech suggested I install the HDMI extension ... apparently wifi noise can interfere with the signal and the extension provides a bit of amplification to clear the noise.  Works perfectly now. Thanks for the excellent tech support! And a strong positive shout out to the tech support trainers!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Rustyduck"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i have a roku box at home and love it, primarily because it was the first on the market. and i didn't purchase this to replace it. i bought this to travel with. we vacation a great deal and even when you're on vacation at the end of the day you find yourself in your condo, apartment or rental home watching local stations or paying for cable.  not anymore, this is the answer and the only way to go.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "roderick may"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was able to purchase the Fire TV stick for $19 when Amazon offered the deal to Prime members, I already own an almost 2-year old Roku 3 which still works great but couldn't pass up this Fire TV deal for another room.I would say that it's value is about $20-$30 but not the $39 retail price. Why? 1) it needs to be powered by a secondary connection either TV USB or to a power outlet. 2) Not enough good apps although the Prime content and Netflix/Hulu plus works very well. 3) just a bit of lag when moving around apps/content (no lag on Roku 3). 4) picture quality of Prime/Netflix/Hulu content is not as sharp compared to my 2-year old Roku 3 was surprised about that since Fire TV stick had better specs.Conclusion: Fire TV stick is a good 1st gen Amazon streaming stick which could be better. It is fairly easy to set up and get started with. But I still recommend to friends & family looking for a streamer box that they purchase the Roku 3 or wait for the 4 when Roku decides to release an update since their product is actually fun and very simple and easy to use and works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "F.C.N.Y."}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I almost never leave reviews for anything, but here goes.  The only app I've used so far is HuluPlus, and it is effectively useless.  Sometimes the audio hiccups and sounds like dubstep for a few seconds.  Sometimes the screen goes black while the audio continues normally.  I'm not sure whether these issues happen with any other streaming app, but I don't really care to find out.  I'll be going back to my PS3 until Amazon fixes this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bill"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "the stick is fine, the service is a huge disappointment.  If you look through the list of movies available, there are some good ones.  But if you go about it the more normal way - say - lets try to see if we can see movie X, or Y or Z (and I tried lots of oldies but goodies) every one i was interested in came with a price tag.  All of them!  I have Amazon Prime for the shipping, and I thought the movies would be an added plus.  I can see the movies are an added zero.  I already have all the other apps on my newish Samsung SmartTV, but Amazon was an excluded app for some reason .  So I bought the Fire Stick.  I doubt I will ever use it.  I have Netflix by mail - which has the largest selection anywhere of 'free' movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amateur Woodworker"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was so easy to setup, I had it up and running in about 10 minutes.
