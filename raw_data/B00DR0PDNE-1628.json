My only complaint is that it doesn't support 802.1X which is a bit of a pain when working with business networks or my home network (I'm a network architect by profession so i have nerd level network gear).  Hopefully google will release a firmware update that will allow it to support 802.1X at some point so i don't have to build compromises into my setup.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tim Hendrix"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jes\u00fas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We LOVE our Chromecast.
