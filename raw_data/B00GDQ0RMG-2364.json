As long as you have a WIFI connections you can say GOODBYE to BORING CABLE and say HELLO to AMAZON PRIME PROGRAMMING.  I\u2019ve been a prime member for a long time \u2013 between holidays and birthdays the shipping savings pay for the membership \u2013 so as Amazon has added services I\u2019ve  been looking for ways to use them.  Originally I used Amazon Prime on Roku.  This worked reasonably well.  But when I wanted to add Amazon Prime\u2019s music service on Roku it wouldn\u2019t let me use any of the free services, just purchased music.  The Fire TV stick not only is simple to install, it lets me use ALL of the services.  So I can put on one of the streaming channels when I want music or I can put on shows or movies.  Another feature of the Fire TV stick I wasn\u2019t aware of was how the apps are differently configured.  For Netflix fan who want to do a marathon of their favorite show they need only leave it on and it will roll from episode to episode.  Which is perfect if you like to have programs running while you are on a cooking tear.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Val"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We absolutely love our fire TV stick.
