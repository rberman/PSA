Includes a USB2-to-USB2 micro cable to power the device. However, this usually does not provide enough power for the device's built-in WiFi card to connect to wireless router that isn't located close to the device. But, it also comes with a power adapter if you need it. I recommend using the power adapter. Amazon provides a wide variety of TV and movies for your enjoyment through Amazon Prime. It's a good deal since you also get free two day shipping on items ordered through the Amazon site.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "regapal"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have used the Fire TV Stick for a couple of weeks and so far it's great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Venice Swayzer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great works great and easy\ud83d\ude0a", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "GREG GENTRY"}]
