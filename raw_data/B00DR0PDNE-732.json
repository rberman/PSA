Samsung's proprietary link technology never seemed to work right and I had difficulty streaming videos from my laptop or phone to my TV.  Samsung link has problems with various video formats and often wouldn't \"see\" new videos added to the folder.  I decided to give the Chromecast a try.  Coupled with the Videostream Chrome extension, I am able to wirelessly stream literally any video from my laptop to my TV, and in high definition (up to 720p).  I also find it more intuitive for streaming YouTube videos to the TV than with the Samsung TV App.  I have had a few connectivity issues when using it for YouTube, though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jonathan Peck"}]
