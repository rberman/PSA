I have a smart TV and now I use this on my non-smart TV.  My smart TV is hard-wired to my wireless router.  My Fire TV Stick is much further away and wireless, and yet Hulu Plus works significantly faster through the wireless Fire stick than through my hard-wired smart TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dragonsaway"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Like the fact that you can use Slingbox, it replaces the need for an additional cable box. It has the major streaming apps (Netflix, Hulu, Pandora & of course, Amazon). It has Flixster, but not Vudu, Cinemanow or Target ticket (I prefer Ultraviolet services compared to the exclusive Amazon, Itunes or Google movies). I have Comcast, so I can use WatchESPN but cannot use Fox Sports Go which is a bummer for a sports junkie like me. Overall, when compared to the other \"stick\" streamers, I like it better than the Chromecast (I like a remote & it saves my phone battery), but I'll hold my judgement when compared against Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James B Warren"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The firestick is good when it works.
