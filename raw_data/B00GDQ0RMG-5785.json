I reviewed my orders today, December 8, 2014 as I had not yet received a shipment notification, and I absolutely could not find this item in my order history.  I then reviewed my emails, found my email confirmation that I had in fact ordered this item, and the order number.  I typed the order number in on Amazon.com and nothing came up.  However when i ran a \"rder history report\" the Fire TV stick was in there.  So I chatted with amazon on-line ... I will not be receiving my Fire stick as they cancelled the order-2 DAYS after I placed the order, because they were out of stock.  So frustraing, do not order until it gives a close delivery date.This is how our conversation went..You are now connected to Levi from Amazon.comMe:Hello, on 10/27/14 I ordered a Fire TV stick, which is listed in my devices, and it is in my email as \"order received\" and estimated delivery of December 10, 2014, however, when I go into my amazon order history i cannot find the order for my Fire stick. The order number is 10/27/2014 XXXXXXXX Fire TV Stick Electronics . When i download an order report the purchase quantity says \"zero\". This is an item we are expecting to receive and we would like to resolve this issue.Levi:Hello E, my name is Levi.Me:helloLevi:I'm sorry you're having problem with the order that you received.

I want to know WHY my order was cancelled. The delivery estimate wasn't until December 10th and this product is STILL available for purchase on amazon . Therefore is clearly is not out of stockLevi:I'm sorry, I don't have the option to the reason why it was temporary out of stock.No worries and rest assured that I will forward your concern to our appropriate department so that they can investigate regarding this matter.Me:i want to know why my order was cancelled if this product is continuously for sale on amazon. it is an amazon device and has been for sale for months.Thank you for forwarding this because we would like the Fire TV stick we ordered, and for the price we ordered it for on October 27, 2014. We are very disappointed in how amazon handled this matter. We were not even aware it was cancelled. I checked my account around Thanksgiving and it was still visible on there telling me there was a December shipping date. And according to you my order had long since been cancelled, with no notification to me.Levi:When an item is listed as \"Temporarily out of stock.

It was super easy to set up, has lots of options and stays connected to my WiFi. Having previously purchased two Chromecasts (one replacement) that don't work well at all, I was a little apprehensive. They wouldn't stay connected and required constant factory resetting, but the Fire stick is so much better. I have had no issues at all except that it is sometimes a little slow to wake up after disuse. My mother has had no trouble with hers nor has my daughter. Definitely worth the purchase. Amazon was out of stock so I got 4 from Best Buy for $25 each.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Khatira"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "We have them all now. Roku, Chromecast, and now the Fire stick. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the installation was ridiculous. It wasnt hard, just frustrating. We wanted it for our TV that is not a smart tv. We use our Roku and Chromecast on that one, but thought this was the perfect solution to our guest bedroom needs. I must have misread, because when they made a comparison to Chromecast, I thought that it meant you can mirror the computer with TV. If you can, please comment so I can do this. With that said, it didn't work in our bedroom. It was having trouble connecting to our router. We took it to the Smart TV, same thing, but after several attempts that's the TV, it will work on. The one we don't need to use it on.  The 3 lines button, do not use this to make upper or lower case, physically down arrow over to the abc when connecting the router password to the device.This is as of DAY 1, I will update in a few weeks. It's nice, the kids like that you can get Netflix and few others, but it's nothing that's not on our Roku. My husband likes the free fireplace app, but dislikes that we will still have to use Chromecast to mirror our computer for other things. The picture is nice and the ease of connecting to my Amazon account is nice and scary.

It also seems to have a harder time connecting to the internet than the rokus do, but once it is up and running it is great especially if you are watching amazon content the instant play is nice and the recommendations update every time you go back to the home page.
