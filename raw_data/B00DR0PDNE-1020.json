It also performed well in streaming offerings from Hulu and You Tube. Casting from my Chrome tabs was not as successful, however, but I suspect that was because the tablet (2012 version of Nexus 7) lacks the processing power to keep up with such streaming. I am now seriously considering switching my Netflix account from receiving DVDs to the streaming version.
