[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I would love the fire stick, if it worked better. I have owned it since it came out. I don't mind the layout at all, bought it knowing it would be Amazon heavy. The problems I have are poor wifi reception, I can have it 4 feet from my router and it will say it has poor internet. I have a smart tv that it's connected to and when the stick continually buffers or doesn't work I watch on the tv app with no issues. Also the farther into a movie I get, the farther the sound looses sync with the video, doesn't seem to matter what app I'm watching, Amazon, Netflix, Hulu plus, ect.I was excited to get an email from Amazon telling me I could hook up bluetooth headphones, only to find out it was a mistake. I was hoping to connect my bluetooth speaker/headphones to see if it would fix my sync problem.The Fire stick seems to have it's software throttled as to not steal sales from the fire tv. To bad, I really would like the headphone connection.I would like it better than my roku and chromecast if not for these 2 problems that show up quite often, and the scaled back abilities.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "YnotMe"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love it and so does my son.

We had to update this out of the box but after that it worked recently when we stayed at a hotel.

I wanted to save money so I bought this fire stick and I love it. I'm saving money and the quality is fantastic. It was easy to set up and it plays an introduction video to help you get started. I don't have any connection problems what so ever but I also have Internet that runs 135mbps. For people having issues with Internet connection you might have to increase your speed, just like Xbox live you need decent Internet to get good quality picture and no lag.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ana"}]
