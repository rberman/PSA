Don't waste your money.  It projects your screen but with a lag time.  It's impossible to watch netflix, movies, or anything for that matter.  Also after projecting for a short period of time, the screen will freeze and no longer protect at all.  I only used it 3 times since I bought it, and it failed every time.  I'll stick with dealing with cords and wires than this garbage.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Kim"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "OC"}]
