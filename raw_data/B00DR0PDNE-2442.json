[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Chromecast will not play all your local files. It is primarily used for netlix, google play, and similar sources that you have to pay for.It will not play mkv or avi files. There is no software that chromecast works with to play local files. You have to try every move though the chrome browser, which most of the time will re-download your files. Its very complicated and a big let down.For those of you thinking it will pay anything on your desktop it does not.It is incompatible with just about every move viewer most of us use. Doesnt work with Quicktime, Windows player, etc. It says it does work with RealPlayer, but the kicker here is you have to upload your files to the RealPlayer cloud then down load them from Chrome to watch them online, not local. This is the most backwards device and a big let down.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Travis White \"Travis\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "The Chromecast is not compatible with the Comcast SMC Router/WiFi.See list of compatibility at [...]  before purchasing Chromecast and then having to return it like me.There are technical issues related to the Access Point or UPnP and workaround.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "GWB"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Displays and plays great from Android and IOS You Tube apps.

This device simply does not work. It's nothing like the simple dongle and \"1 2 3\" setup that's advertised. There are additional cords needed. Setup never worked for me even after hours of troubleshooting. As with all google products, there is ZERO support. After several hours of troubleshooting, the device then stopped even showing a power light.
