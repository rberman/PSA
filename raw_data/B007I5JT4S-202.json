I like that you can play live disney Junior or previous episodes. I aao have used air play quote a lot, streaming YouTube videos from my phone to the Apple TV as well mirroring my Mac mini (to play some movies off of).Overall a great investment if you have apple devices. I am thinking about buying more.Only negative is that for some apps, I have to constantly reauthorize.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Christopher W.

Also, Apple  \u00c0 la carte is way too expensive for the average Joe. Discussed with Apple, it's not my home network or Internet provider.Originally, I thought AppleTV might be an alternative to DirecTV or cable, but now I only use it to stream iphone to TV, and not very often, I probably should sell it.  I broke down and got Time Warner again.  Time Warner is better now with the mobile apps to run the box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Parzerot"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product , new. App comes up.

I am pleased with the continual software updates, which have added streaming services where the subscriptions are compatible with iTunes. I have enjoyed Netflix, Hulu+, PBS, the History Channel, as well as the purchased movies and television programs in which I am able to view their high-quality display.So far as cons are concerned, the Amazon Prime app is not included, and that is a minus. Second, Pandora is left out, and in spite of iTunes having its own radio streaming service, which is available on this device, Pandora is still my favorite. And last, but not least, I wish that there was a much greater bluetooth compatibility range so that I could link it with at least my Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker or my Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker.All in all, the Apple TV has been most instrumental in helping me reduce the amount of cable clutter that has existed around my TV, and if it could add its wireless capabilities in terms of linking with other devices, that would be an added plus.After owning Apple TV for at least two years and witnessing the evolving features that have surfaced over time, I have little difficulty endorsing it with four stars. It is surprisingly a product that one has reason to increasingly appreciate, especially in a perceived day and age of planned obsolescence.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JON STRICKLAND \"Jon Strickland\""}]
