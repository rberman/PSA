I just canceled cable, don't have a smart TV, and needed something to stream my Netflix & Hulu accounts. After researching Chromecast, Apple TV & the Amazon Fire stick, I knew I was picking the best choice. Being an Amazon Prime member sealed the deal with all of the extra Amazon Instant TV movies/shows to choose from. It's simple to connect, it's user friendly, and a steal at $39 compared to the Roku & other streaming devices. I highly recommend it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
