The Chromecast compatibility site says setup with this router does not require any modifications to the settings... Wrong!  That site listed firmware that is several revisions old and with the version on my router and any newer firmware, it requires a ton of changes.  Google this router model and Chromecast to find several web sites describing the various settings needed to get Chromecast to work... I almost returned it but after several hours, I got it to install.  Once installed it works great with all our android devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NHConcernedConsumer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Really love the Chromecast.Pros: easy to use with iPhone app, portable, helps make Netflix accessible on every tv in the houseTo me, only con is that because we have an older tv, we do not have a usb port so we have an ugly plug hanging off the side", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BikeLock"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product, but need some updated to improve your funtionality.
