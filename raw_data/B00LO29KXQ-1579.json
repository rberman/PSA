Very fast streaming", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jade"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The FIre TV stick strive for greatness yet once again, just like the Fire Phone, fell short of expectations.As is the case with Amazon product, the products appear well constructed, first-class built and hyped greatly by its well-developed advertisement wed page. When I have the choice between this Fire Stick and Roku Stick for my 3 month special Sling promotion, I chose this after reading its wed page and considering all the hypes around its hardware. And as was the case with the Fire Phone, I was quite disappointed.First, the Fire TV isn't exactly popular with apps developer, as is the case with everything in Amazon stratosphere. You will notice that in app advertisement, Amazon put Youtube.com and not the usual YouTube red logo. That's because YouTube doesn't have a dedicated app for Amazon Fire Stick yet. Though this is the least of my problem since there is alternative app that function just the same. I am only mentioning this as proof that app developing for Fire Stick is quite underdeveloped.Second, the app that is active for Fire Stick isn't exactly well developed! SlingTV and MLBTV apps were the main reasons I got this stick to begin with and the lagging, slow responsiveness, freezing and untimely exits have caused me to pull out quite a few hair from my head. I can't vouch for Netflix, Hulu, or HBO Go since I am not subscribed to their services but I can safely assume that their functions isn't much better than what I experienced with Sling or MLBTV.Lack of contents and dysfunctional apps really drive the value of this seemingly powerful stick down. I don't know exactly how Amazon's gonna woo all those developers when the public interest in its Fire Stick remains limited either. So save yourself some time and grief (hair as well), go buy either the Roku stick or Nexus player. The Amazon TV line slowly but surely will end up just like its phone, giveaway nobody wants.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KIET N."}]
