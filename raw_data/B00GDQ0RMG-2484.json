Connects so much quicker and every TV app I could want.  So excited the last update came with HBOGo.  Stream GoT weekly with no hiccups.  Hulu has some lag and freezing issues that I believe are not this Stick's fault because Prime, Netflix and Flixter stream great.  I do wonder if the size of this thing means it lacks memory so Hulu can buffer better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gene C \"li0nhart79\""}]
