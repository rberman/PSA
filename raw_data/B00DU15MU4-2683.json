I got tired of the slow response and random reboots from my Roku.  The Amazon Fire is much faster and much more responsive.  However, I am a little irritated that it doesn't have the newest Netflix app.  This is fairly common however.

The remote is Bluetooth which means you do not need to have a line of sight, and can move the box to a location that is not a visible eye sore on your entertainment system.  You can easily side-lode non Amazon applications such as XBMC, which allows you to stream all of your media content from local network shares.  The simply user interface is great for non technical people as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "RWKeenan \"Rich Keenan\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Although I admit I am not a big tv/movie watcher, this is a great deal.

I will be honest and say I did not know what I was buying when I got this. I just thought it was a box to view my Amazon prime movies on\u2026but it is so much more. Apps for games, live TV from all over the world and movies, movies and more movies. Three weeks after I got this we canceled our cable subscription. So much fun!
