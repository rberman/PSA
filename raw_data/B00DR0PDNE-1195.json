The first week was great, then I was gone for a few weeks and the next couple of weeks since then every day I have to unplug and plug in chromecast for it to show up on my tv.  I also have had troubles casting since then and need to close down all the apps, reopen them and try to recast and that usually works.  If it had no oddball bugs every single day it would be great, but... This was really just to test it out anyway, it pretty much failed, so... Getting 2 Apple tv's to replace it and sending my chromecast to my guest room or workout room instead.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lrdmn"}]
