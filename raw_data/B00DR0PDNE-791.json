It allows me to stream just about anything to my TV, ranging from pictures on my phone, to using several \"Cast\" enabled apps such as Netflix, Pandora, YouTube, etc. It allows easy sharing of whatever I have on my phone through my 60\" TV. I use it often do to presentations in my living room for my home based business without having to have the need for a projector, etc now.Pros:- Small and easy to plug into the HDMI port- Many apps support \"casting\" to this device on your TV- Easily turn your \"dumb\" TV into a SmartTV- Great picture and audio quality when \"streaming\" from your phone.- Price is amazing. For $35 you upgrade your Dumb TV to a Smart TV, instead of having to spend 100s or 1000s more replacing your TVCons:- None", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Frankwin Hooglander"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works fine.

The Verizon guy told me I could get them on my phone with the app and cast them to my TV.  Great concept, crappy execution. Come to find out, the video you want to stream has to be Chromecast compatible... most aren't.

If you\u2019re using the Chromecast for Chrome on your laptop to project tabs, the video quality and audio can dump quite a bit. It\u2019s almost useless in IOS you can't cast screens and in chrome you can't even cast tabs. I bought with the device under the impression you could mirror your screen from your laptop, but you can't........there is terrible lag. The technology states it is still in experimental mode.
