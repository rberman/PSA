The Amazon Originals shows are actually our favorites to watch. Lag is almost non-existent and the voice search recognizes different speech patterns and dialects with ease.UPDATE: The surface of the unit is a high-quality matte finish, which appears to help deflect scratches and dust. The unit does not come with an HDMI cable, so you will need to purchase one separately. I've recently started using the gaming feature of the Fire TV, which runs smaller games flawlessly. The system-intensive games almost universally require the gaming remote controller, which I have not yet tried. On the whole, I am very satisfied. I've gifted Fire to my family twice, as it makes a great gift for >$100. I do highly recommend.Amazon Fire TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "C.

Before Fire we just had Netflix, Hulu and Prime with a standard HD antenna.  Now that we have Fire, all of our content is in one location and there is much more to watch.I will be purchasing another for our other TV.

The speed is amazing. A couple days after I ordered this unit the price came down $10 or so dollars. The app for watch ESPN won't work for me because Charter is not affiliated with Amazon. We did away with cable tv so we got this box to watch netflix and watch espn which is a app they advertise for. It's a great box.

The first issue was during the setup process when the unit and the remote control just would not communicate with each other.  After a repositioning the unit a few times I finally got it to work, but even then I found myself needing to press the buttons on the remote a few times before the unit responded.Then I fired up a live streaming baseball game using the MLB.tv app.  The picture quality was excellent, but then it started the whole freezing/buffering/restarting/buffering routine.  This was happening every 30 seconds or so, making it impossible to watch a game.  Streaming Netflix or Amazon videos was a bit better but still not perfect.I ended up returning the Amazon Fire TV and replacing it with a Roku 3.  The Roku has performed pretty much flawlessly.It's a shame because I really wanted to like the Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "8/11", "author": "TonyJF"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "its so much easier having this than watching prime on my computer or kindle! the only problem i have with it so far is its range and im not entirely sure that problem isn't my internet.it's small and compact so it isn't intrusive.I can't figure out how to turn it off though; so i just change the source and leave it be. im guessing it just gets unplugged. The heat of it after a while concerns me a little as im afraid of the consequences like burnout.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KT"}]
