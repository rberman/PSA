I have two Apple TV's, and while I like that I can connect with my iTunes library to view pictures, play music, etc. I do not like that the only way I can get it to connect is to unplug it each and every time.  I installed the Stick and it simply worked doing what it's supposed to do.  The definition of videos streamed seems to be clearer than the Apple TV, which surprised me given the difference in price between the units.

Easy installation, easy interface, easy to download apps. The comparable fire phone app makes typing in login and password information a breeze.
