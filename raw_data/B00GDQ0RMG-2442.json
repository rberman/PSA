Dad was dealing with a dying Roku box and though I was perfectly happy with my Roku 3, I decided to give it to Dad and try the Fire TV Stick. I'm not very happy with this particular buying decision. To begin with, I wanted to order it through my Prime account, but Amazon was temporarily out of stock. I ended up going to the local Best Buy for an in-store pickup. Pretty amazing that Amazon, with its business model of copious product availability, would get caught with empty shelves on a self-promoted item, but so be it. My bigger problem is that I keep comparing what I have now with what I had with the Roku and there is no comparison. Obviously, Roku has a few years head start, which gives them an unfair advantage currently, but an advantage it is. And as for the included remote control - first, I had to watch two separate YouTube videos to get the battery compartment open and since then, I keep hitting the Home key when I meant to hit Play/pause. The keys are way too close to each other and there's no tactile clue for one over another. Really poor design, combined with a paltry (though growing weekly) selection of apps. I'm not sure it'll be around for much longer in my living room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles E Accetta"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I traded a Google Chromecast for this, and I was Very Glad I did.
