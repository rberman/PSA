I can stream my entire movie and tv show collection right to my TV from the palm of my hand, or on my tablet or computer. It does have bugs at times and crashes but I don't hold it against it. It has saved me from pulling out old cables to plug into my TV, which was such an absolute hassle. I also love that I can stream a ton of apps to this like HBO/SHOWTIME/STARZ/CINEMAX/etc. BUY THIS TODAY!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Steve"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I am not impressed at all with my chromecast. Every time I try to watch a movie it plays really slow and always stalls. And it always disconnects while I am trying to watch something. I would not recommend this at all.. I actually regret it and wish I would have went with Amazon fire tv instead. This is a disappointment..
