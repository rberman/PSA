[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Pretty disappointed because I am usually SO happy with any and everything that Amazon does. But it keeps freezing and sometimes while watching a show, it will just randomly stop and go back to the home screen. Then I go through all the clicks to get back to it, and it happens again a few seconds or minutes later. Often happens 10+ times in one episode!Other than the glitches, it's a great product. I used to have my laptop connected to my TV to watch everything so it's really nice to be able to use my computer and watch TV at the same time. Can watch Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime, Showtime and more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MFS"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David L.

Also works with my android phone and with my Sony TV remote, though I've noticed it occasionally hangs with the android phone (Chromecast wasn't perfect on this either, might be my phone).  Slight problem with so many ways to control it as the kids get in change-the-channel wars.  Able to watch Youtube, Crackle, etc.  The included games are good for a few minutes of fun now and then like you might play on your phone if it had a remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marlon R.

However it works great on our Verizon jet pack wireless but really eats up the data.  Easy to install and use.

Easy install. Very pleased. The only complaint is that I wish the remote was easier to see in dark... a button where you can opt for icons to be backlit, perhaps?

Your Kindle has to have mirroring on it and mine doesn't.  I guess you need the Kindle Fire HDX.....in the description it just says Kindle Fire and I assumed mine would work.  It will be more worth my while after they add the HBOGO app which looks like is coming in the spring of this year.  If Amazon had explained in the description and listed compatible devises, I would have given this  5 stars and waited to buy it after they add HBOGO.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "amy kamin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chante Bradley"}]
