[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "This product does exactly as advertised.I initially bought this for the bedroom as I already have my living room television set up with my Xbox. The only knock against the Chromecast is that there are not many vendors yet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Floyd"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and I wanted to be able to watch Netflix and some other services on my television instead of just my smaller computer screen (I don't have xbox or anything like that, so I can't watch like that). The installation and setup was simple and there was a guide.The packaging is great! No sharp, difficult to open plastic, no wasted space whatsoever, and everything you need is in it. Just a note, the HDMI extension thing is really just a few inches long, so be ready to buy a longer one if you need it. I don't use it since I can just plug the stick directly into the TV.Being able to use my phone to turn on, pause, and seek in Netflix from any room in my house is great (not that I really need to be able to play a show in my living room when I'm in my bedroom, but I like the flexibility).The only thing I don't like, and this is really not something Google has any control over, but the selection of Chromecast-enabled apps is fairly small. Two that I would love to be able to use with this are Watch ESPN (for sports) and Spotify (for music).Other than that, this is great and I'd recommend it to my friends!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David King"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wonderful product, great for Netflix and Pandora.

I am an iOS user, so I love that I am still able to use chromecast functionality on my phone. My TV is a smart TV that I purchased in 2011, but since buying the chromecast, it's all I ever use. I stream my music from Google Music, and watch Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO Go and YouTube. It's cool when I have company over because we can all cast whatever we want to the TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christina"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I got this just on the promise of having netflix/hulu available without a Roku/Wii etc. It has a beautiful splash screen and I like being able to put on a flick with my phone.  Sometimes Netflix is buggy and stalls out when I select a new movie, but I think that's on Netflix. Hulu seems to work every single time without missing a beat.I'm glad this is popular- I'm looking forward to more and more apps available.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Randelius"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've used this countless times.
