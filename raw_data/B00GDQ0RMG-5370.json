My kids have messed around with it. It seems easy to use.  They have found some free games, and all of them have turned their smart phones into remotes for the device.

Sorry Comcast you usefulness is becoming limited.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Longbow2"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Overall, it's nice to be able to stream the Amazon Prime benefit to my TV. I already have an Apple TV (and a smart blu-ray I don't use) to deliver my music, Netflix, and Hulu Plus so I didn't buy this for those.The biggest issue I've had with the device is that the wifi signal from the device significantly interferes with my HDTV antenna signal. I have a high-powered whole-house antenna with amplifier and I live in a major U.S. city, so reception isn't the issue. I finally pinned down the issue being the proximity of the stick to the coax connection on my TV. I can only use the stick if it is at least two feet from the back of the TV, which defeats the design.A few other issues with the device:- The interface is clunky and not easy to navigate- There doesn't appear to be an easy way to put the device to sleep - which is not energy efficient and contributed to my problem above- The Amazon images are a little misleading and do not include the power cord that the device needs to operate", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Eddie D"}]
