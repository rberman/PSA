It is nearly worthless.  DO NOT frustrate yourself by renting a movie.  Hours and hours to download, then 24 hrs to watch or it's deleted.  Still don't know how Captain Phillips ended.  I was a major shareholder in Apple stock until about a year ago.  I just tried to watch a movie trailer of 2:20 min duration.  That was the last straw.  Too bad.  I love my iPad but Apple TV is crap.  After 10 mins still not playing, still loading.  Save yourself the aggravation.  Apple should not have brought this product out.  It stinks.  I miss Steve Jobs, I fear Apple is in decline.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Susan Garman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you have an iMac, MacBook, iPad, or iPhone and you use iTunes, then the Apple TV is an invaluable addition. Hook it up to your tv and stereo and you can rent movies, stream music and movies from your computer or iDevice, and even mirror your display to your tv via Airplay. Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, HBO Go, and a slew of other channels round out an all around wonderful device. Easy to hookup and get running, like all of Apple's products.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "psacks"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was a gift for my son.

But i think this is a far better product than the Roku, as far as ease of use, setup, and quality of picture. Its sleek, small, and SO easy to use! I did buy a Logistic multi-remote because i got tired of losing the tiny apple remote and having to use 3 remotes (TV, Sounds, Apple) to do things, so i'd suggest investing in a multi remote to make life easier.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christina T.

Thanks", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ehab"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My family is part of the emerging trend of 'cutting the cord', we get all of our media through the internet.We subscribe to Netflix and Hulu and get the other shows my wife enjoys through the 'Season pass' subscriptions offered in iTunes.If you buy all of your music and video from iTunes, this is really the only easy way to get that content on the big screen. Setup is easy but takes a while, because entering your passwords and usernames is painful on the included remote. Apple provides an App for iPhone that is a must-download, it really makes navigating the Apple TV faster.The Apple TV comes with several apps. The only problem is that many of them, like HBO GO, require a cable subscription and HBO service. The PBS app works without a cable subscription, as does the Bloomberg and Sky News apps. There is not an Amazon Prime app, unfortunately.AirPlay, an Apple technology that lets you stream your screen contents from your OS X device or iOS device (iPad,iPhone), works flawlessly, I could see it being useful for presentations on TVs and it's a great way to share what you're doing on your computer with the family. Again, as with most Apple things, it only works with Apple devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Joe Dodge"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The best price on the Web and I loved how user friendly Apple made this device.
