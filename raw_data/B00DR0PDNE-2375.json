[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "At this price point, I saw no problem getting two of these (one for the basement, one for the bedroom). Very happy with it in terms or reliability, ease of use, and visual quality. If not for a couple of shows we pull in over cable, I'd cut our TV cable service in a heartbeat.Big con right now is the lack of customization (services either support Chromecast or they don't; supported services are currently listed under a Google search for \"Chromecast apps\". You can cast a web page, but generally, quality of video playing through the web page cast is poor.If you watch a lot of YouTube videos, Netflix, etc., highly recommended.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark T Tomczak"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Chromecast is simple to set up and isn't bulky, so you don't have to make a space for it on the entertainment center.It's a little quirky every now and then, but it's nothing that the occasional reset won't fix.The streaming is good as long as you have a good internet connection.My only real complaints are the lack of apps available at this time and the occasional quirky moments.

Enjoyed the product so much I ordered another.Problems began immediately. I was unable to configure the newest CC and unable to find it from any device. Google's help pages are useless - and unfortunately so is the internet which is why I am writing this review.  The iPad Air, the sammie S3, and the Win7 laptop can no longer see either CC which are  all on the same network. Most painfully, when I plugged the newest CC into my Onkyo home theater receiver, it \"burned out\" the HDMI port which no longer recognizes either the Playstation or Roku 3 box. The receiver flashes \"Resolution Error\" across its LCD display, something I've never seen before.Thanks Google for 1) a product that doesn't play well with its own kind, 2) providing null support, and 3) selling cheap equipment that ruins much more expensive equipment. I hope this is not a sign of things to come from the people at Don\u2019t Be Evil.RMAs went in for both today.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "zimmazam \"zimmazam\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am a youtube junkie so this is perfect.  Also a netflix user so it is really good for that as well.  If you want to use your own local media you can always use the plex app or have a file management extension on your chrome browser that allows you to stream whatever it is on your current tab to your tv.
