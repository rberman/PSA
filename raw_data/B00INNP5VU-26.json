[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Worked fine for awhile, then just totally stopped working after a little over 3 months. This was the 2nd roku I bought, as I loved it so much on my bedroom tv, I wanted another for the family room. I've had my other roku from Walmart for almost a year with NO ISSUES! This one convieniently crapped out about a week after the 90 day \"warranty period\". Typical. I wish I had just bought another brand new one from Walmart or wherever instead.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D. Sullivan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product!

The remote frequently loses connection and becomes unresponsive for minutes at a time. The apps running on the device are extremely sluggish and fickle. They often fail to load forcing me to sign out of them completely then sign in again. Or else completely delete the app and reinstall it. Though sometimes the Roku won't even let me uninstall an app. The streaming is unreliable\u2014even with a solid internet connection. When it's working well it is a passable device. But it runs poorly so often that it's not worth the frustration.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DB"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Waiting for grandson to set up for me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elaine Carter"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jennifer cozzitorto"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "loading works continuously and never comes up.
