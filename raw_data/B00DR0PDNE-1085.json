Sometimes chromecast reboots automatically but will not be up unless manually unplug and plug it again to TV and thats why it is 4 star.

It helps to up the chromecast device and you can seemlessly cast your movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Goparaju"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Austin pierce"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I think this is awesome.

You can't beat the price.  At first I loved it, but whole \"cell phone as remote\" thing is not ideal.  Pausing my show to answer an incoming phone call is a pain.
