I purchased this to specifically expand the tv viewing options in the basement, but the tv won't support the mode. Following further research online (because it isn't identified on the Amazon troubleshooting site) it appears both companies acknowledge a communication error between the fire stick and the Samsung tv, I'm sure you will be shocked to hear that neither company is taking responsibility.

The best feature of this device is its ability to be controlled by the TV's remote controlled. There is no need to use tiny remote that comes with it.The Fire Stick gets 5 stars but the flimsy remote gets only 3 stars hence the 4 star rating.  There is no setting to make the remote slightly less sensitive. When I press on the right or left button, the selector jumps two or more apps. It is very difficult to select the app that you like.

The Fire TV stick is extremely fast - responds instantly to inputs from the supplied remote and scrolls smoothly when browsing content categories.  The picture quality is fantastic too (equally good on content from Amazon Prime, Netflix, and the ACC TV app - go Syracuse!) even though my wifi bandwidth is only 7-15 Mbps from an old Linksys WRT54G WiFi router.  The Fire TV stick is so much better than my Roku box, but then again my Roku box is several years old.
