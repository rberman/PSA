[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Its ok but disappointing compared to expectations set by existing media devices and the kindle fire. Navigation isn't that much better than other devices like the Roku and its yet another ecosystem where you need to hope you will find all the correct media apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Alexander Hopmann"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "After using the Fire TV for 3 days, below are what I don't like:1- The home screen is cluttered and it is all amazon content, I have an apple TV and the home screen is easier on the eyes, moreover iTunes content only occupies the top row of the screen.2- If you are connected through Wi-Fi, you can not configure the network setting (DNS for example), in case you are using a wired connection, you can not modify individual settings, instead you have to set all network setting via a setting wizard style menu!3- Although I expected snappy performance, there is a lag while scrolling through apps, or titles.4- The voice search feature is only dedicated to amazon content.I think I will be keeping my apple TV until hopefully amazon addresses these issues in future updates.My recommendation is if you already own a Roku or Apple TV don't get the fire TV, as the hardware they are bragging about is worthless if the interface and features are not well thought.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Outsider"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I got this since I have been a prime member for years and figured it might be worthwhile and possibly even allow us to cut the cable completely.  It has many nice features, but does not stand out.The good:- Very nice looking.- Construction seems solid.- Came already setup to my Amazon account.The bad- Interface is not that great.  Functional, but nothing outstanding.- Voice search is nice, but only finds Amazon stuff with no way to limit it to Prime (free) items.- Voice search will not look through Netflix or other sources.I had great hopes for this when I got it, but it seems quite similar to the Roku 3 HD I already have.  I would not buy it again, though I will give it another shot with the controller that just came in the mail.  I don't expect the game play to have a significant impact on the score here.  It is rather meh overall.Failure to provide searching for free content across providers is understandable, but means it is not really worth purchasing.  I am still giving in 3 stars since it is quite functional, compact and nice to look at, but it did not have the functionality I expected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "BradA \"Brad\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Interested in this Amazon fire tv just wondering if there is a monthly fee or is it a buy and Play ?", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/7", "author": "Vicscam"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "won't start up EASY as stated. been 1 hour still no amazon Fire Tv what the heck is up with this  device", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "Gary A.
