We plugged it in our TV and it was ready. We use it for Prime steaming, Netflix and amazon music. Also can watch you tube. Very simple to use! Great price!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Missy \"Missy\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I purchased this primarily to use in Hotel rooms, on their somewhat challenged WiFi. It worked, however, there were sometimes issues with buffering. I found I could pause it for 5 minutes or so, then restart the show and never had any buffering pauses after doing that.  It became my routine to find what I wanted to watch, start it, then pause while I did something else for a few minutes, then watch the entire show without interruption. Given the fare at most hotels, this was wonderful and well worth the price.Now I am home, and using it on a second TV with my high end WiFi equipment and there are no issues. The only thing I want is the ability to control it from my PC so I could search for content faster.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles F.
