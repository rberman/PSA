Also love that there's a phone app remote because my only complaint is that the remote is small and black and gets lost often with kids in the house. My son can use the fire stick for games instead of my phone which is great as well.  I also like that I can upload my pictures from my phone into the amazon cloud and view them on the TV via the fire stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shelli Gitchel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "diamond"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "easy to install", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Larry"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jo Manuele \"Stuzzi\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "As good as a ROKU only less money!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Norman Kublin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my fire tv stick!
