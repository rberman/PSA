The TV's app tested the connection EVERY TIME I WATCHED something. Meaning it took forever for the stream to start.

The good side to it is that it's inexpensive and small. The bad side to it is that the processing power isn't the greatest meaning it frequently pauses and makes you wait for your video to load, if it loads at all. Overall, if you need a media streaming stick for a low price, this is your best bet. However, if you can afford another media streaming player such as the Roku, then go for that.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Chadd Schwartz"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far so good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marcas Hemmila"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "My reason for buying the tv stick was to be able to stream movies without having it buffer so often.  I see an improvement, but it still buffers.  I now have a wifi network extender and a fire tv stick and still can't watch an entire movie without these interrptions.  Disappointing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "JAMES M SCHUDER"}]
