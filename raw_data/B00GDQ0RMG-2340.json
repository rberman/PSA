Since I already had Amazon Prime, the Fire Stick was the logical streaming device to chose.  Of course, I had to wait for it, as Amazon kept running out of them.  When I got it, it worked fine, although it took several tries to put in all the various passwords required.  I also downloaded the remote control app for my Kindle, although I rarely use it.  The regular remote works fine, unless you have to type in a search string.  The stick is ideal for watching things on Amazon Prime, as long as Amazon has what you want.  Netflix works well, too, but we've had minor problems with buffering on Netflix when the source material is HD.  I like the fact that I can listen to all the music I have loaded on my Kindle Fire through my home theatre system using the stick.  I've been kind of disappointed by the limited selection of free movies on Amazon Prime and those available on Netflix, so I'll probably still use Redbox for newer movies, since the rental price is so high on Amazon.  Overall I've been pleased with the stick, but like all streaming devices, the content is limited.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.
