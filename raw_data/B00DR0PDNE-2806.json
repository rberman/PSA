[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I've been using this device with my iPhone 4S (iOS 7) for a month.  Once you install the chromecast app it's as easy to use as native AirPlay on the Apple ecosystem.  However, only a few apps are supported and the videos will take longer to appear on your TV.  This is a delay you will notice only when your video streaming starts.I decided to use Chromecast as the streaming solution for a secondary TV.  At $35 is certainly a bargain.  Hope the Google guys soon add additional apps and make some performance improvements.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "FSTB"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Pros:Great device, easy to setup, easier still to use, delivers great image, great bang for the buck, potential to use many of these devices across the house without breaking the bank and last but not least: brand new Plex support!Cons:Few supported sources at the moment, although with the quick adoption rate of this device, the low price tag and the capacity of the device, it is fair to assume that the situation will change quickly over the next year or two.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S\u00e9bastien Quirion"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This makes looking at any program enjoyable on a larger screen. works like it says can take from one tv to another", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Barbara D."}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Other than the flimsy connector, I resented the need to switch browsers......I don't like being manipulated by Google, so I sent it back.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Thunderturkey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I live in Ecuador, southamerica, and once i purchase the chromecast i read a review where it said it only worked in US, anyway i decided to give it a try. Once my GC arrived, i connected it to my tv (Panasonic Viera 32\") and synched it with my Samsung Galaxy S3 mini, it installed the latest update for chromecast, recognized inmediately my internet signal, and boom i was watching you tube videos from my cellphone. I couldnt be more happy with this device, its small, portable and runs smooth every app. For 35 dollars i think it is a good investment!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "cristhian terranova"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this device.
