I couldn't get it connect/stay connected to my wifi for the life of me. The router was less than 20 feet away and when I'd detect networks it'd show full signal. Despite that it kept dropping the connection. After about 45 minutes I was done. I was ready to box it up, send it back, and leave a one-star review. I'm glad I took a deep breath and did some research first. If you have the same issue USE THE HDMI EXTENSION! I don't why, but for some reason it solved all the connection issues. Maybe the stick didn't like being horizontal? Maybe it felt short? All I know is once I connected the extension it worked amazingly well. I've been watching movies and streaming music without any issues since. There's no buffering, the image is clear and bright (I don't have any lines or green screens like others have reported). Since I purchased it through my Prime account it already had me set up.All in all, I would highly recommend this. I was so sad when my ROKU died, and I'm pleased with this replacement. The remote's signal strength is much stronger than the ROKU and I don't need to \"find\" the sweet spot to get it to work. My TV is an off brand and the Fire TV Stick is working just fine.The only reason I'm giving four stars is my frustration in the first hour after opening the box. I wish it would have just worked as expected without the extension... but at least it was simple fix and it worth it in the end!All in all, I would highly recommend this.
