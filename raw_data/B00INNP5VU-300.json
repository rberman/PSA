I was a little scared at first because I didn't understand that it plugs into your HDMI port AND your USB port as well...but it works perfectly!...which is SUCH a relief after having purchased 3 (yes...3!) Roku 2's in the last two...maybe three weeks...SO...for this guy to work your TV MUST have an open HDMI port as well as a USB port...but besides that I'd have to say that it works perfectly (I'm watching Fringe on it right now!)...and as for the apps...well...who could say no to apps like...Amazon Instant Video...Netflix...HBO Go...Showtime anytime...and of course...M-go!...(YouTube isn't a bad option either)...but anyways...if you're on the fence about getting this...get it!
