This price was an absolute steal.  The price is now $39.99.I definitely made the right decision to purchase the Fire TV Stick over the Chromecast.  I was deciding between the Chromecast or the Fire TV Stick and the price (preorder) basically decided it.  I like to test my equipment to get a grasp of how it works and reading reviews and videos doesn't give me the full experience.  And essentially the Chromecast and Fire TV Stick are doing the same thing so I went with the Fire TV Stick.So here's a quick summary of why I chose to purchase the Fire TV Stick:1) TV Remote.  The Chromecast doesn't have a remote and this sealed the deal for me.  I did not want to go onto my phone since I like to be all snuggled up under my blankets when watching Netflix so a TV remote works well for me.2) Prime video and Netflix / Others.  It seems more streamlined and is easier to navigate.  If I want to watch Netflix, Twitch, etc. I just go to the \"Apps\" section and go to the app and I'm good.  If I want to watch something on Prime video, I go to Prime video and I'm good.  It's really nice to have the layout all streamlined and laid out very well.So connectivity wise the Fire Stick has good connectivity and so far I haven't had any issues with it.  No break in the connectivity and everything is holding up well.If you are a Netflix / Twitch / Amazon Prime user this device basically solves all of your needs. It's extremely well thought out and works well.  I don't see why you wouldn't take this over the Chromecast as of this  point since there's a remote and the apps are now out for iOS and Android.  (Yes there is more compatibility with Chromecast / Android since you can just pull the notification bar down).I only docked one point because the only thing I did not like about it was the lag in some of the apps and videos.  My internet is about 50 mpbs so the subtitles should be loading perfectly fine.  Otherwise video quality is great, loading time is great and the interface works well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Yang C."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is fantastic.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "So, We were happy to get the fire stick as a replacement for our aging Roku XS - and minus the lack of  VUDU - things went great for about a week. now, refuses to connect to our network half the time, when it does connect - it might play for 10 minutes before it hands or goes to the spinning circle (buffering or whatever it is) - so back out to home, then it takes forever to pull up any other app.  so far, what looked to be very promising has dove quickly to dissapointing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Darin Wolfe \"avid reader, computer geek, musician,  voice-over artist and Audio-Book Narrator\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this stick, very easy to set up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is okay.  It's much faster than streaming via our Samsung Blu Ray player and it's relatively cheap. However, Amazon's customer support of this device sucks, they are simply helpless. I spent an hour on the phone today trying to get a fix for an audio problem. About 90% of the time if we turn our TV off, and then turn it on later the Fire TV Stick audio is gone and the only fix is to unplug it and restart it the Fire TV Stick. This always resolves the audio problem. None of the people at Amazon device support seem to have a clue why this is happening. However, I Googled the problem and found a number of forums where there was helpful advice.  Apparently the problem is with the way the Fire Stick and my TV communicate through the HDMI port. I have an Insignia 39 in TV, and the settings need to be changed INlink control is on, this always the TV to automatically control CEC devices via the HDMI port.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tim Peterson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great and easy to use, I did have to power cycle a few times but satisfied with the performance and reliability.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "If you expect to be able to use your \"universal remote\" with this, you're going to be disappointed.
