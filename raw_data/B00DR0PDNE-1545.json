My fiance likes that he can use it to seamlessly stream youtube videos, and that he can display the desktop or any open window of his tablet on our TV, to show videos or photos to friend and family. I also enjoy that i can use my tablet to stream a movie onto my from netflix for my niece and still play on facebook or check my email on the same device.  One of our other TV's is a SmartTV, and this works better and faster than the Smart connection.  He plans to buy one for that TV as well.My only complaint, is that it doesn't work as well with the Chrome websites as I'd like it runs slower and is glitchy when you try to web surf with it, but I rarely try to use this for anything other than netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have a roku and plex server, so this isn't as useful to me as it could be.

Took it with me to a family vacation in the Outer Banks. We had grandchildren and their parents along. Luckily we had new large screen TV's and plenty of HDMI space.
