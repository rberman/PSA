But I was so wrong, and I want to earn forgiveness by endorsing Fire Stick TV. You don't have to unlock your phone to use this.

Small and so easy to use.  Easy to install.  Only complaint is that the HDMI  will not connect on the new Samsung TV I bought through Amazon in December.  It may be the fault of the TV because it works on my old Samsung TV connections.  I love the fact that the Stick is portable.  Great idea Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sondra Worden"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire Stick works great.  Only thing is I thought it went into the USB port on the TV, but it goes into the HDMI port.  I have to unplug my cable box and plug in the Fire Stick.  But that is a minor inconvenience.
