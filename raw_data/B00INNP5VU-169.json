(And actually I don't even know if that's the issue because it says it's connected when you check the connection). All I know is I've spent almost as much time dealing with connection issues as I have watching movies or shows. This happens with Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus which tells me it's a device issue and not an app issue. I've known older Roku products to have this issue but I was hoping that had been solved in the newer versions!Overall I'm really disappointed with this product and will be returning it unless I can figure out how to solve the connection problem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ash Cox"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you are into watching movies or just want to catch up on some TV shows. Then this is the one you want to buy. I own both the Roku and the chrome cast and both are fantastic and both have their strengths. I bought this Roku for my mother and it is a very easy device to set up and use.

It worked fine for the most part, although I did have to unplug the power cord from time to time to 'unfreeze' the screen.

No password anywhere! Then I tried going into Netflix which I am a member of and it asks me for a 4 digit passcode which I couldn't find either.  I followed all directions, so then I decided to try the reset button.  Tried it 4 times and it just kept getting stuck on the same screen.What a piece of garbage!  Maybe mine was just defective but Roku didn't leave me with a good first impression.  I took it back and purchased Chromecast.
