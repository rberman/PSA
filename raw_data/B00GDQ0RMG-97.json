I love that I can go to Amazon Prime on-line - look up a title and add it to my watchlist immediately - very cool. An excellent value at a very reasonable cost.

The only downside is sometimes you have to wait for a movie to load even with movies you have purchased or with Netflix. I don't have this issue on my computer so I don't think it is the internet- it could be though since it is a much bigger picture.
