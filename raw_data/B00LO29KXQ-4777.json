[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "As much as I wanted to like it I couldn't because it just simply didn't work well.  For some reason the unit didn't want to connect to Netflix.  After an hour of trial and error, I finally got Netflix to work.  That's when the fatal flaw was found.The unit just wasn't able to stream continuously.  After about five minutes of viewing, the unit would begin buffering.  This process would occur numerous times during an hour-long show, making it an hour and half ordeal.  As busy parents, our TV viewing time is at a premium, so the frustration was just too much.We returned the unit and opted for the roku 3 and do not regret the decision.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "D.
