Sullivan \"Amazon Addict\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Fire TV Stick was delivered Friday evening & plugged it into my main TV in the living room. It powered up just fine but would not connect to my wireless. No problem, maybe it's just too far away from the router. Installed it on the TV in the room next to where the router lives - it sees my wireless but chokes on the password. Installed it on a TV in the Den/office 2 feet away from where the router lives... power it up & it sees the network, sees the internet but won't connect to Amazon.com. Error message says: \"Could not contact Amazon.com. Please check your router or select another wireless network.\"Spent almost all day Saturday troubleshooting & trying everything I know - changed wireless encryptions, passwords, wireless channels & even tried it with a completely wide open wireless connection (no security at all).Nothing. Same error again, still.Used the Amazon \"Call Me Back\" feature which is a really good thing & was handed off to Tech Support. After about an hr of wasted time, he had me hold down the 'Home' button down for 5 seconds while the Stick powered up & nothing happened. I guess it's supposed to go to a setup page of some sort which didn't happen. The Tech puts me on hold for a while & comes back talking about escalating this to the Development Team who may (or may not) have an update that will fix the problem (or not) & he would call me back as soon has he had something. Maybe next week...I said that was unacceptable & that I had already paid for a working unit. This one is clearly defective - send me a new one & I'll send this one back.After a little back & forth he finally agreed & sent me the return shipping label to send it back & a tracking number for the new TV Stick which should be here in 2 days.All the people I spoke to were very polite & courteous.I will post an update when the new one comes in.ChuckUPDATE:Apparently the problem was with my wireless router. Bought a new Linksys WRT 1900 AC yesterday & everything is working as advertised.Hope this helps.Chuck", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chuck Lightly"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is amazing!

Set up is really easy, just plug it in, watch a short tutorial and you're ready to go. I do have a USB port on my TV but it didn't provide enough power to power the Fire Stick so I did have to plug it in the wall (which is recommended anyway).  I've not used all the functions,  but there are a ton of options for any TV lover.  I purchased this for the TV in my bedroom, a small 19\", because I didn't want to pay the monthly fee for a cable set top box for a TV I use occasionally.  I already have a membership with Netflix but there are options for free movies and TV shows.  I did a fair amount of research before I committed to buying it, I'm a big fan of Amazon and have a Kindle Fire so I was a little biased with my selection.  Since my wireless router is on the same floor as my bedroom I get a good signal without any lag, so I can't comment on how well it receives a signal from a greater distance.  I have an iPhone 6 and the app for voice and text search is available in the app store, which makes searching for shows easier.  The remote is small and unobtrusive, which I like.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking to replace their satellite or cable or to expand their current TV experience.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin D"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My daughter just loves this thing.

You can use Netflix or watch Amazon Prime anywhere you have an HDMI connection! The problem is I've had to reset this thing 15 times in a row before to get it working again. It works one second, then just keeps saying Netflix has encountered an error, forcing me to switch to another device to continue watching a show. The \"HD\" video is really 480p, from my experience, despite me changing the settings to 720. I bought this to replace a Roku I had and it's no better. Almost exactly the same video quality, except the menus on the Fire TV Stick are in HD.  Video buffering is an issue too, as almost every video starts fuzzy like a drunken night out.  Another thing I didn't like was that you have to plug the unit into a wall power outlet. I feel like that is glossed over in all the marketing.Amazon, I expected SO MUCH MORE. Disappointed doesn't describe well enough how I feel after using this for a few weeks.  I never write reviews and felt it was my obligation to do so, after using this. I will update this review, if they release an update that fixes the video and network connection problems. It's not my network as my Xbox One, PS4, iPhone, Roku, computes, etc. all connect to my network and work just fine. Amazon, going forward let's only put your name on quality products please!  I wanted you to be the cool high-spec device you appeared to be instead of this faulty piece of stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Karl Daniel Adrian"}]
