[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "So I don't claim to be any technology guru and don't plan to post some long extensive majorly specific review of the Fire TV Stick. I am just your average working mother/wife.  But I do LOVE this device.  I have the Chromecast and the Fire TV.  My children were always using the Fire TV so I decided to invest in the Fire TV Stick for my bedroom. So glad I did.  Now I have all of the same features in my room and I can enjoy all the Fire TV Stick has to offer in my own quiet domain.  I also love that I can link my Kindle to this device.  I plan on researching further to experience all this device can do but for now I am quite pleased with it.  It is very simple to navigate and I get to enjoy it all to myself!  Would definitely recommend this to all.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DaddysKeyz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love the fire stick, however, it was extremely difficult to open the back to insert a battery. We ended up going online to find any helpful hints. So glad to see it wasn't just us that couldn't open it! We followed the advice of some fellow strugglers and finally opened it! Definitely needs some design improvement!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. Kelly"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Quick start up and easy navigation. Initially installed on a TV in a bedroom and performed well. Later moved it to a TV in the family room. Buffering made it unusable there. An XBOX in the same location performed much better despite taking longer to start up and get to my Netflix account. This may be related to the wifi reception in that room, but both units are using the same router.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Peter Branower"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "amazonprimer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to set up, with the free aps you get a great selection of tv, movies or games.

It's good for what it is, but is functionally no better than Roku or AppleTV, unless your goal is to watch Amazon Video. So for Sling TV and Amazon Prime, it's great, but that's it. The physical remote and the need to download specific apps to Fire TV are so last decade. The Fire TV Remote app for Android makes navigating even more difficult than the physical remote. Finding content to watch or listen to is not an easy task. And even if I start watching Amazon video on my phone, I can't easily send it to the TV. Amazon needs to take a cue from Google's Chromecast. And if Sling TV and Amazon Prime worked with Chromecast, I wouldn't have this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

Nice to not have to use your iPhone to stream you can see it all on the TV. There is the option to use your phone as the remote but the remote is nice.
