This thing is great! The content on my smart TV hasn't been updated in ages, playing Plex content is wonky, finding things on Netflix is a nightmare and I still can't seem to make the Amazon app work right. The Fire Stick fixes all of that!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James Wright"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Its perfect for my situation, doesn't take a lot of room and very easy to install", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bertha B.

I bought this after seeing movies on Prime movies that Netflix did not have. The remote is a much better design and I was able to plug the Fire stick into one of the back HDMI ports on my bose system hiding it completely from sight instead of having to find a place where it could see the remote and be an eyesore. Even being the stick and not the big fella it seems to be faster than the apple tv and not have as many gliches. The best thing about the fire is the app section actually had VLC player which now allows me to play all the movies on my networked harddrive. The only negative I have found so far is the organization of prime movies. I wish that it had subgenres. Overall if you have Prime and watch a lot of movies but don't play games you would be a fool not to purchase at this price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Egg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Simply amazing.
