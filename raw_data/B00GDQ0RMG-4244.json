Overall it feels like it's trying to sell you stuff more than it's trying to help you find stuff. The search really only works with Amazon prime, and will try to sell you the Amazon version even if the movie/show is available on Hulu or Netflix. It's slow and clunky, lags and crashes.Pros:-Standalone apps for everything, doesn't need to cast from another device.-Comes with a remote... (Though I don't really like the button selection/usability of the remote.)Cons:-Unlike the Chromecast which turns on when you turn the TV on, the Firestick seems to always be on and gets REALLY slow. Sometimes there's a multi-second delay just going to the main menu and moving between things.-It takes a lot of effort to get to things with the remote. Typing is a pain. The UI is slow and not at all ideal. I'd rather use a chromecast with my phone or tablet than Firestick most of the time.-Flickering. Sometimes the TV flickers with green lines. Doesn't happen with Chromecast.-Crashes. I've read this in other reviews, and I experience it myself. It will just crash while watching a show and doesn't recover. You have to go back into the app and start playing again. This sucks for Sling TV for channels like Cartoon Network which don't allow rewinding/pausing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "John Gibson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to install.
