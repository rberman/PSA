However,  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy  the set up was, even for a \"non-techie\" individual as myself.The audio setup companion was very useful and the content was more than sufficient and diverse for it's intended purpose. Streaming quality was good even with hotel WiFi, so will likely be that much better if used with personal/home connection.Definitely one of my top purchases this year.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CO"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I own Roku, Chromecast and Fire TV stick, Fire TV is so far my favourite.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TR"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "There are a lot of bugs to work out with this one.

It seems that I need to go to the Home to do that, but the device won't go home because it can't connect to the internet.  What a waste of time and money!!!!  The device is worthless for the purpose for which it is intended, so now I'm watching my movies on a 7\" screen.
