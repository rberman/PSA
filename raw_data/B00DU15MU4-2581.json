I can't get more than 2 local channels via antenna and they are usually only available on clear days.  I just cut my digital tv (through the phone company) and I get much MUCH better picture quality from the fire than I ever did with my digital cable.  Direct TV (and others like it) didn't have picture quality that compare to the Fire TV.  I'm very pleased with this little gem!  Most of the movies and tv that I would typically watch are available through Amazon, but Hulu plus and Nexflix can also be accessed via this great little device.  I'm very happy and extremely pleased with this.  I think I've found the tool that will work for me!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "M. M.

Bought game controller, didn't see a game I wanted to try. About 2 weeks in, it kept error messaging, wouldn't download, despite Amazon tech intervention, after a third error message interrupted my programming, I returned it.

I originally bought the 8.9 HD thinking it would be connected to my TV and it would be used for that purpose only. When I got it, I found that using it as a tablet became so much more important for reading, playing games, checking e-mail, and limited surfing (I still like my lap top for major on-line work) so having it connected to my TV didn\u2019t work for me. I sent it back and ordered the 7.5 HDX with the Fire TV in a bundle - thinking I could use both in conjunction with each other- great idea but I found that the 7.5 tablet was a bit small and it was hard to read from \u2013 I am getting older and my eyes aren\u2019t what they used to be. The HDX had a lot more features but I found I really didn\u2019t need them.  So I sent back the 7\u201d HDX tablet but kept the Fire TV which is amazing! - It has a remote - so being able to sync my tablet with the TV wasn\u2019t as important even though it would be nice. The HD will connect with the Fire TV but I haven\u2019t figured that out yet.The TV Fire - works great! It is easy to navigate and connects to all the services I wanted to use it for \u2013 Hulu, Netflix, Amazon prime and more I haven\u2019t tried yet. I was able cut my Dish subscription in half! I have found much of what I watched on dish can be found for free or cheaper on-line with many more benefits like movies and TV shows. Once you figure out what you want to watch you can limit the subscriptions you will want to pay for monthly. What is on Amazon Prime duplicates some of what is on Netflix or Hulu plus. I am trying them all right now and will figure out which ones I need. The tiny Fire TV box freed up space on my TV stand it is small but it is very powerful. It is worth the $100.00 price tag. If you are going to go to on-line TV watching this is the system to get. I re-ordered the 8.9 Fire HD which is terrific! The size makes it easy to read and navigate between Aps and is clear enough to read magazines with pictures that are easy to see. The 8.9 is a bit heavy but after using it for awhile I got used to it and it is manageable. The 7\u201dHDX was extremely light weight but getting the bigger screen is a trade off that I was willing to deal with.The combination I ended up with is the best choice for me. It took me a lot of time trying things and sending stuff back and forth (Thank God for Amazon Prime \u2013 it saved me a fortune in postage). The Amazon People are great about returns. If you are looking for a combination of tablet, reader and on-line TV this is a good one.I suppose the best combination would be the Kindle 8.9HDX and Fire TV but I thought that cost of the bigger HDX was beyond my budget an extra $150.00 seems a bit high to me.I hope this helps for people that are looking for the right combination of Amazon products maybe you won\u2019t have to go through all the trouble I did.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Joe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was easy to start up and run as Amazon products usually are.
