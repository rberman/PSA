With that being said I have really enjoyed it, it works smoothly, it was very easy to set up, I love the fact it has a control, and it gives me the flexibility to switch from TV to TV. I have never used a Chromecast , have little exposure to Roku, so I wouldn't be able to give a fair comparison. I would reccomend the FireTv Stick to anyone who is looking to purchase one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "RickyG"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica Whitman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ruben Ligon"}]
