It took 3 tries yo get the update to download so I could use it but it want a hassel and it probably was my internet connection and not the stick.  I read all the negative reviews and I don't agree that the remote is cheap.  It's very easy to use and i love the way the home page is set up.  This little sick is just what I was looking for.  I almost purchased the Fire Tv Box.  In fact, I had gone online to do so the day the stick came out and was able to purchase it for $19.  Now I can listen to all my prime music and watch prime movies on my TV without having to plug in my Kindel Fire tablet.  Ohhhh, and I absolutely LOVE the photo display that come on if you have the stick on idle.  I would personally Thank the person that added that feature if I could.  The photo collection on that feature is amazing.  I sat and watched just that last evening for at last 15 minutes.  It was very calming.  Thank you Amazon for another great produce!Update!  It got even better!!!!  If you are listening to prime music and go to the home page (just click the home button), the stick will go into idle mood and you will then have great music and beautiful nature photos all at the same time.

So far, I love it! It was so easy to set up and there are so many great features. I like that I can use my photos for a screensaver. The streaming for the Prime music is cool too, it even shows the lyrics on the screen for some of the songs. The remote is easy to use and things are easy to find. The only slight problem I had was that the cord is not long enough to reach my outlet. So, I just plugged it into the USB on my TV and it seems to be working just fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JJ"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Hooked up to the TV easily... however had a problem recognizing my internet password a few times (I was putting it in right... the characters show on the screen). I've only used it a few times, and have only streamed some Prime and Netflix content so far, so cannot comment on the other capabilities. Remote is snappy, streaming so far so good (a little faster than my directv genie box) so it downloads quick. Packaging was put together well. All and all, very well worth it to make your TV a smart TV... especially if your a prime member.The only thing that takes away a star is what others have mentioned... Amazon Prime members content not being put into its own category. This is done obviously to encourage the purchase of content... but it would be nice. 5 stars all day if Amazon ever makes that change.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MikeyH"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Tons of entertainment value for your dollar especially if you have Amazon Prime and Netflix accounts.

I received this as a gift and I'm SO thankful because it's awesome!So far I've watched Netflix, rented movies, listened to Pandora and played around a bunch on the thing. Everything has worked great! I don't have a Smart TV, so for internet streaming this far exceeds my expectations and is WAY better than how we were streaming (through a Nintendo Wii). The interface is user-friendly and straight forward and the whole thing is really easy to use.I would add, as a father to little ones, the Fire TV Stick is tied to your Amazon account and renting a movie is as easy as 'click & play' and boom there goes $4. So after my 2 year old daughter rented a movie we've since decided to hide the remote throughout the day :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anthony Crombie"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "had to help a bit on finding the remote by holding the home button down for a few seconds, find entering search criteria easier than I expected, responsiveness good in scrolling around the icons, result is pleasing to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bryan Leipper"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got the Fire Stick for $19.99, I love the price. We did have a bit of a problem plugging it into the HDMI port on the TV, but after that the fun began. The tutorial is great, the features are wonderful, it downloaded the photos I had on my HDX8.9 and the music I had stored as well, without request....wonderful. I used all the features, everything works fine. I do have to use three remotes (sounds crazy, but it's OK), one to turn the TV on, then the Sony remote to get to the correct setting, then the Fire Stick is good to go. Of course you do have to reverse the process, no big deal. Now I can have watch movies on my TV, watch shows I may have missed and listen to my music w/o ear buds. Thanks Amazon!!!
