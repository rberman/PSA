I finally tested it for the first time today and I noticed that the charger port was loose and it popped out twice before I finally got it in and charging. I was getting disappointed at that point and worried that I have wasted my money on this device because I also have a chromecast and that one lags a bit but this is actually slower than the chromecast. Also the buttons are difficult to press. It gets stuck in the remote as I press to navigate. I don't recommend this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "CHRISTOPHER UBANDO"}]
