I love that it's compatible with StarzPlay, since none of the other casting devices currently are. My only problem (and it's kind of a big one) is that it malfunctions all the time. Constantly losing connection with whatever I'm casting it from. I know it's not my wireless connection, I'm the only one on it and I typically shut down all other tabs that I'm not casting. Sometimes if I'm watching something I have to reset it multiple times during 1 episode just to get it to continue to cast. If this didn't happen, would definitely be a 5 star product.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AmandaLeigh \"AmandaLeigh\""}]
