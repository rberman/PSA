We got it when we cut our cable. Amazon content comes in clearly and quickly without buffering/downloading/etc. I haven't been thrilled with some of the 3rd party apps (Hulu plus runs pretty slowly for us- probably because we have slow internet service. It buffers frequently, but not so much I can't watch- just enough to be annoying). Overall, I am pleased with the Fire Stick and would recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Erin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am so happy I finally bought this.
