Could not be happier!!!!However I caution against buying a sepetate cable to power the Chromecast in the USB port on your TV.  Mine didn't work, apparently my tv's USB doesn't produce enough power for the Chromecast to work.  However it worked just as beautifully as promised once I used the power cord that came in the box with the Chromecast and plugged it into the wall.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adrian"}]
