Amazon Fire Stick Not Ready For Prime Time.Day 1: Didn't work without  HDMI extender. Looks good. Clear, sharp HD image. Very pleased with Fire Stick. Then, bottom falls out and Fire Stick sucks out. No fire, no connection. Remote has no effect, no control. Frustrated, cursing, Vow to return product.Day 2: Seems to work fine in morning and early afternoon, then at night...same problems, after good reception for about 20 minutes, picture starts freezing, sound continues, then everything blacks out. Hit Pause, then Play, show resumes for maybe two-minute intervals, always with picture freezing. This goes on for about 5 pause/plays and finally we get frustrated and shut the whole thing off and go back to Roku. Roku reception: fine. Fire Stick dependability: 0.What the hell happened, Amazon? You should work the bugs out before you take peoples' money. Shame on you.I am returning this thing for a refund.
