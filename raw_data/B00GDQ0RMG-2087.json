Overall, I am very pleased. It is very easy to navigate through the menu. Easy to add Pandora and Hulu. The wifi works very well. Makes my Netflix and Pandora accounts stream much better than they did through my blu ray player. My displeasure is in the length of the charger's cord (it is not long enough to be concealed behind my cord keeper on my wall), and there seems to be an issue with the Hulu app that no one wants to fix. The Hulu app has a black screen after commercials (audio but no video) and the video freezes frequently yet the audio keeps playing. I did take Amazon Prime and I am 50-50 on it. I find that several movies that I have already viewed through my Netflix, have to be rented on Prime. I don't understand this. I am paying for a service through both, but actually believe that Netflix offers more than Prime without further charge. There are no older TV series on Prime (except I Love Lucy, and I would like to see 70's, 80's).  Well, I suppose I should say no free TV series. Lots that you can rent. So far, I like Netflix better in that respect.  I do like the ease of renting on Prime, however.  Time will tell as to whether or not I continue Prime. If you have an older blu ray player and want some of the newer apps to stream, I would recommend the Fire Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Gutsy Grandma"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.
