Sweet. It worked great for the first few months. But for the past three months it's gotten worse and worse. Half the time it won't connect at all, just restarts and restarts over and over again until we give up and turn the TV off. Other times it will restart as many as 15 times (If we haven't given up by then) and then FINALLY connect and work. If it ever connects on the first few attempts we can be clear into an episode in Netflix or Amazon Prime and then have it restart. Amazon's solution was to do me a favor and let me return it for a refund and then re-purchase a new one at $20 MORE than I paid the first time!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Nortys6"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works good, definitely not as user friendly as Apple TV, but also much cheaper.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kr"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We had originally bought Chromecast but became frustrated when we couldn't access Amazon Prime.It also was awkward sometimes because we had to use our phones as the app controller.
