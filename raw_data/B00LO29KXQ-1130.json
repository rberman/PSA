This is my least favorite. That is not to say that it isn't good for the price ($19 when I got it), because it is, but it is significantly slower than the Fire TV box or an Xbox One. It is still functional and for someone who's less electronically spoiled it would be a perfectly fine option. But if you're used to the Fire TV box or Xbox One or PS4, you will probably find it lacking for everyday use.What this is most useful for is travel. Going on a trip? Just pop it in your bag, it takes up almost no space and does the job.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "carolyn"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I have been using Roku 2 for a few years now and I bought Amazon Fire TV Stick about 5 month ago for my second TV. As a Amazon Prime member, i thought i will give it a shot. Comparing those two devices, I like Roku 2 better.  There isn't much difference when i watch Netflix, or Amazon Prime contents. The biggest frustration that I have with Amazon Fire TV Stick is when i watch YouTube.  I search what I want to watch on my cell phone and sync it to device.  I never have a problem with Roku 2, but it just doesn't work with Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aki Takahashi"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It will not connect to the internet!!!
