Picture and sounds quality are outstanding for a stick.  But, we returned it because we couldn't keep it connected to our WiFi network.  Our WiFi router was about 30 feet from the stick.  We tried 2.4Ghz & 5Ghz bands.  We used the HDMI extender cable.  We don't have the same connectivity issue with any of our other WiFi devices (laptops, tablets, phones) so it must be something with the device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BillandMarcia"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Fire Stick itself performs well but many of the apps need to be better developed", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Connor"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought this for my daughter and she lovessss it...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "April Williams"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Prime delivery.
