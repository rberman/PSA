Hopefully Google and Amazon will work out their differences..... would be nice to 'cast' the Amazon Prime streamable vidoes... but, there is a work-around.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "U2strategy"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The apps that it has really well. But I'd like to see Amazon streaming video as Chromecast. Streaming from chrome browser tab, sometimes the video and audio get out of synch.

Only caveat is that it only works with certain prorgams like netflix and pandora.  dont expect it to turn your tv into a full on smart internet tv", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mina Kim"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This is no doubt a game changer IF you live in the United States. As an American living in Germany, it does little for me. The only extras we get is YouTube, and that content is blocked by GEMA, a nationwide German musicians union which wants money for American music played in Germany. No other extra channels are offered.Frankly, if you live outside the USA, you are better off investing in an HDMIi cable,, or connecting a small computer to your television,.  If Google can ever find a way to think about the rest of the world market, they may actually make a dent.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Sylvain M.

The only downside (hence the 4 not 5 stars) is its gets very HOT! when plugged in even when not being used. Have to remember to unplug it from AC when I finish. Have to figure that the heat may reduce the life of the unit which might explain some of the failures mentioned in other reviews.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Paul"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Not a compatible TV set with this streamer.

However, downloading into a computer and then sending via WiFi to a television is not very convenient.  It requires a functioning and available WiFi which many times isn't the case.  On the other hand, Apple TV mirrors directly from my iPad to the TV.  I think the extra $50 for Apple TV was well worth the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
