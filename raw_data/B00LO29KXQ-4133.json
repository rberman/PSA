This is the only device in the house that is having connection problems.  Of course amazon gave great customer service and has a replacement on the way but as of right now I have a sour taste in my mouth about this stick,  I got it because I have the nexus player and I can't get anything amazon up there which sucks when your a prime member.  As of right now I'm really not happy with this tv stick, hopefully the replacement will be better and if so I'll adjust my review,  but for right now all I can give is one star and that's being generous since I can't really watch it without Internet connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "tbreez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've only had the Fire TV Stick for a few weeks but it has by far been a great purchase as I have been enjoying some great prime shows on it.

The only reason I gave this a 3 star review is because the remote is sticky when selecting to the left or right. I will go to scroll to the right on Netflix and one click to the right and it will skip over 5+ titles making it real annoying when I'm trying to select a specific title. I'm thinking this might be just with my remote but still would recommend it because of how small it and discrete it is", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ray R."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Its not as easy plug and play as they say it is.
