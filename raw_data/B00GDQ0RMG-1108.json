Watching HBO GO on this stick results in an extremely stuttery picture. It's like an extremely low framerate or something, looks terrible and almost makes you feel dizzy watching it.Until they can fix this and make HBO GO run correctly on the next version of this stick, it's probably not worth a buy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DudeMon"}]
