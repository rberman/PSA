Anyways thought it through and still think it's good for those with good wifi but not for me. Oh well. Also I will mention that the smallness of the stick and the slick design of the remote is pretty cool so aesthetically its on point!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "joshua and mimi \"joshmimi\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I also own a ROKU Stick and compared the Fire TV Stick spends more time loading the videos.
