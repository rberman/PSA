[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "The device and installation are great.The service was not what I expected, and that may be my fault for not better investigating accessible content before purchasing.  I purchased on an impulse to see what it's like.  Not being a Prime member, I'm very disappointed in the amount of free or low cost content that's available.  I hate the cable company and the idea of paying for TV content--especially the same content that is typically broadcast for free and I'd not watch at all if it was not \"on\" at the moment and free on TV.  In short, based on my quick scan of available options and content, Fire TV is not a real alternative to paying for TV content or a way to \"cut the cord\" for cable in a meaningful sense. At most, it allows you to pay Amazon instead of the cable company, and possibly save money if you watch little TV and therefore pay for only what you really want (but $2-3 per episode would add up fast and eliminate any possible savings for many users).Why is it taking so long for content providers to treat (live and recorded) streaming as just another public broadcast medium (like the airwaves) from which they can profit in the traditional way--paid advertising--without charging users for access?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Scott E Davis"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Awesome features!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "yani frias"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I like the speed and user-friendliness, and the ablilty to still get my NetFlix, Hulu and Amazon stuff....Great device...I have them throughout my home", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Penny Landry"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Better product the Chromecadt", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert Rotticci"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Irene C."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works great I can watch Netflix now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mort"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Be cautious before buying this fire stick over a Roku! We got the fire stick tv for only $19 so I thought it was a no brainer but my Wife warned me. we have had our roku for a few years and just love it (mostly just for netfix) we got it in the mail hooked it up and it worked great but then it kept stoping and reloading every 2-10 minutes which drove us nuts. I wanted to throw it out the window. my 8 years old son didn't want me to get rid of it because of the free games he can play using even the regular remote. I ended up getting smart and switching locations where the roku and fire tv were located. turns out that fixed the issue. my point is the roku still works a far distance from our router and the fire tv does not. for $19 in the end its a great deal but usually the price is the same. if its the same as a roku for you, buy the roku!! also, listen to your wife!
