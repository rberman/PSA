Seriously?!? I thought Google was cutting edge?- Limited services with mobile apps: Yahoo, Hulu, Netflix, Pandora and Google Play- Minimum requirements not listed ON THE BOX when purchasing- Internet browsing only works with Chrome Browser (of course), but getting Chrome Browser to work on some video sites (i.e. Syfy) took some Google searches to figure it outOVERALL:I can watch TV shows from CBS, ABC, SyFy on the internet via laptop -- with lag -- on this device.No lag with Roku box...going back to that device.I cannot do any browser based viewing from any mobile device.**UPDATE 11/7/13**I just realized all three of my Blu-Ray players also do Yahoo, Netflix, Pandora, Vudu and many, many other streaming services (paid & free). So no need for this device until more services are offered and mobile internet browsers are supported. The only thing I see this being useful for in its current state is when you are traveling and want more control on what your hotel room offers to watch.Because of the devices potential, I left it at a 3star vs. a 2star.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy way to stream YouTube videos or Netflix to your TV through your mobile phone or tablet.

I was counting on the promised \"cast any Chrome tab from your mobile device\".  That is not available at this time.  We decided to watch an amazon prime movie.  I thought that would be no problem as long as I used my computer.  The tab would show up on the TV but the video wasn't supported.  So far it has been a fail for the things I purchased it for.
