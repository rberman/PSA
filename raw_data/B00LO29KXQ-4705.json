Also have had a google chromecast for several months, still not loving it.  Fire Stick is the way to go!  Only issue, it occassionaly freezes, and can't find home........have to hold the select and play key to reboot it.

Overall the fire stick does its intended purpose of connecting you to apps and amazon prime accounts. However, there are a few bugs that still need to be worked out. The random dropped wifi and the random buffering problems of tv shows and movies is a big pain. I have read multiple reviews commenting on the very same buffering and dropped WIFI network issues happening.
