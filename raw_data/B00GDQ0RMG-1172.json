Grandkids can watch disney all day long ..... lots of movie access", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paula Frazier"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works well, easy to plug in and set up and offer a higher variety of shows, channels and apps, as well as games.  If you enjoy playing chess on a big screen TV, this is for you.  In my opinion, this is better than Hoku or Crome. It works with your Netflix, HBO, and much more!  And you will save money with movies and shows. The best of all: you can download apps, games and shows directly from your Amazon account or Amazon Prime @ your computer to your Smart TV. You might consider a broadband or high-speed wi-fi for this, because the faster and stronger is your signal the better it works.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Flavio Van Boekel \"Flavio Van Boekel\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire Stick offers so many viewing choices, its difficult to chose what to see.

Also some of the movies and old TV series that I like.  Access to so much.  Downside is having to pay for everything.  However  cost is similar to buying DVDs and once you buy and put in Library, it's yours to view all the time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Debbie J. Blake"}]
