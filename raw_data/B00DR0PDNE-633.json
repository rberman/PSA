Tested it on different Internet speeds as it claims it requires high speed this device worked for me on 2mb of course buffering is required at times but if you have broadband instead of wireless what I have will work great. This shows flawlessly from 5mb and up but if you want super HD quality your going to need higher speeds. Don't let that turn you away though it still works great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "andres ruiz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LaTonya Brown"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Chromecast!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.
