It is so easy and simple to use to stream videos and it is also very affordable. So instead of having to pay for a Roku or another gaming system to stream netflix and hulu, we got this. Love it! And with the software I can stream movies from the home computer that we already have.It's so great and easy to use I bought one for my mother who is not very tech savy for Mother's day and she was able to set it up and she loves it!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sicilianchica"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Gre gre jjnhhjjj ffgg Shang ffgg ffgg ffgg ffffg fight dawnn auto corect hid jffgh ffgg ffff juju uh just.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "James R."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like it very much,just wish it would work on Kindle then it would rate five stars.

The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is the lack of support for Amazon Prime Video.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NCWV"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "There are a lot of pros to the Chromecast. It's easy to set up, but so are the competitors, it can mirror what you're watching or have selected on a phone or tablet but, so can competitors. Functionality wise, it's can do the things other boxes can do, and at that point, it is experience that matters. And unfortunately, the experience with the Chromecast is disappointing.The lag time between selecting a show in Netflix and it starting to load on the TV is just long enough to wonder if it's not working. Then the show has to start loading. I understand that there will be a load time with any streaming service, but Chromecast's load times were shockingly long (all use on a functioning 50mbps connection).There was also an audio lag of about a quarter second on all shows, across multiple apps. I tested in multiple HDMI ports, and nothing changed.The lack of remote is also annoying, not a deal breaker, but it feels like you need to dedicate a device to your TV.The device feels like it's 'good enough.' If you've never used another streaming box or dongle, it's fine, but Apple TV or Roku users who might be looking for a step up from their current devices should stay put, as the Chromecast is a step down in function and quality.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott Landis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is the best purchase I've done is amazing and cheap.
