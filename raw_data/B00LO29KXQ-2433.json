I have the original Apple TV (with 40GB HD) and it moves about as fast. Some videos load waaaaay faster on FTV than ATV could ever wish to do. But I think the wifi only makes this dongle lag slightly. I've noticed video jerkiness and audio out-of-sync frequently, which I rarely see on my integrated smart tv or on ATV. I'll keep it because it was cheap and it does a few nice things (Prime video, Netflix, Hulu) that I can't do otherwise easily. The prime interface is waaaaay Better than on my old Samsung TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "B. A.

However, it totally sucks that Amazon has now placed this at 39.00 when it wasn't long I ordered this and paid $99.00 ! Are you Kidding me..(laughing ) Well here goes the review first wait a while before purchasing and I do mean wait as you can see the price lowers drastically. Next, this little gadget is nice especially when traveling and staying in hotels. Our teen enjoys watching movies , playing games and such. So, on rainy days when on vacation this is sure to keep you entertained if you prefer not to be out in a down pour. It saves money as well from buying movies when your on vacation..thats a plus as hotels charge a bit much.Waiting in an airport on long lay overs wahlah you've got the magic stick to keep you from being bored out of your mind. It's a good deal at 35 bucks so I'd certainly grab a few perhaps for your child that's going off to college this fall!!Thanks Amazon for dropping the price after I purchased at 99.00! \ud83d\ude0f", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lovingfall"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.
