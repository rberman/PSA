I plugged into my TV and it did have to update which might have taken 10min as I didn't time it with a watch. The complaints about the sorting and finding free stuff, etc aren't completely without merit but if you take the words literally you can figure it out. If it says \"shop\" that means pay, if it says \"prime\" then free. I will say some of the amazon pilots are pretty good and with access to Netflix we can usually find what we want without paying rental fees. I pay for Prime for the shipping and the deals as far as the TV its just an added bonus for money I have already spent and is worth it.All in all I can recommend it without hesitation to anyone. But I will disclose we have a basic cable package where we live and don't have any other steaming devices so my opinion might be biased based on lack experience with others.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christopher Hales"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Really impressed with the product's hardware, snappy response time and interface.

I have a good internet connection (25mbps+) and have gone into Settings and selected the highest resolution available (760ppi not great). If I can't resolve the picture quality issue, I will return the device.Update: Looks as though the issue was with the HDMI cable. Changed out the cable and higher resolution option appeared in settings. Picture much better now. After using the device a bit more. The remote has a nice quality feel to it but seems to be a bit over sensitive sometimes.Edited my star rating from 2 to 4 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bobby"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like the voice search feature and the remote works great.  I will be glad when Amazon finally catches up with Netflix on selection.  Then I can drop Netflix.  They have finally separated free prime from the rest.

Unless it's a really good sale, I recommend just buying a regular TV. Use the money saved on the Fire TV & a subscription to stream your favorite programs. For anyone with a Kindle HDX, Fire TV is the perfect must have to enjoy the mirroring feature. The voice activation capability on the remote is wonderful for searches. Fire TV naturally doesn't have close to the 1,200 channels that Roku has. I wanted the greater processing power, smaller footprint, added Bluetooth feature, & 8 GB internal storage.I hope Amazon continues to reach agreeements with additional streaming media providers.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Alison"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this for my brother who hasn't had TV in more than 20 years (he's a recluse).
