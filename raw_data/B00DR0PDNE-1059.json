It took a few minutes to connect to my TV and I was casting media from a tab on my laptop and can continue using the laptop for other activities while watching the TV.  I was going to give it 4 stars because I could not get it to stream Amazon Prime, but I just read in the questions that it does and it is very easy.  I have another streaming device that was much more expensive and I spent many, many hours on forums trying to figure out how to get it to do what I wanted and many kind people gave me advice and instructions.  I got the Chromecast during Black Friday sales and it is just easier and less stressful for me to use the Chromecast.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kathleen M.
