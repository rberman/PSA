[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I haven't been impressed at all. The remote's buttons lasted all of a week before they lost all their liveliness and feeling. The buttons feel like garbage and have zero responsiveness, specially the main circle navigation button. Very difficult to use now.My LG tv for some reason doesn't recognize the signal unless I click a button to wake it from sleep before I turn the TV on.I bought this with the idea of traveling with it, and hear there was a software update to support connecting to hotel WI-Fi, so I guess that's nice. Haven't tried it yet.I bought it for Sling, or got it free for paying for 3-months of Sling. Been happy with that experience for the most part. I understand Sling is working out some things from their system.I enjoy watching Hulu and Netflix better on my old Apple TV that is plugged directly into my router. The HD seems to be way better than the Fire Stick over WI-FI.Would I recommend it?
