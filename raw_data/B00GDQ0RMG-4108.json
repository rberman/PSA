[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Not simple to set up and not easy to use. It was next to impossible to open the remote to put in batteries. You need a knife and a lot of pressure to open the remote. After plugging the fire stick into the HDMI outlet on my 6 year old Sony TV, I got... nothing. I called for assistance and they were very helpful and will be sending another fire stick, but I don't believe that one will work either since I'm fairly sure at 6 years old my Sony is not compatible with the fire stick. It would be helpful if Amazon could list the TV's the fire stick is compatible with and if yours isn't on the list, you can pass on the fire stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

I though it would receive it's power through the tv.  I had wanted to be able to use it with more than one device but the cord makes it difficult.  Otherwise great product.

I cut the cable cord quite a while ago as I'm not an avid TV watcher. The cost just wasn't worth it, even for basic cable. So I hooked up a good indoor TV antenna for reception and rented movies from the boxes outside stores or got them free from my library. The price is right but inconvenient due to picking up and returning them. I had been contemplating this purchase for a while. It's awesome to just select a movie anytime I feel like it. Really like documentaries and there's plenty of movies and shows to choose from. This purchase ties in nicely too with my Amazon Prime membership!Forgot to mention that it's real easy to hook up and use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ellen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Super excited about the fire stick.
