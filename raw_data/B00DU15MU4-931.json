The high def is wonderful, and the colors are so beautifully bright!  Again, another product that did not take long to get, or to install.  I can use Netflix and Amazon movies and games with this smart tv.  I also purchase Amazon fire with a game controller and remote control.  The game controller is for my grandson to play games, especially Minecraft, which he loves.  I wasn't able to set up the Amazon tv immediately with the remote control.  For some reason it wouldn't let me use the remote to program and set up the Amazon Fire setup, but since I had the game controller too, I was able to set it up immediately using the game controller instead.  And the next day, my husband sat on the phone with the \"help\" people, and finally got the remote to work as well.  Don't know why it wouldn't work right away, but eventually it did, and I love that I have so many more options to pick from with Amazon Prime and Netflix avaliable to me.  Wonderful TV, Wonderful Amazon Fire!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Charlene F. \"ciocichar\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "What an amazing piece of technology at a very affordable price.  It works right out of the box.  All you need to do is enter the password for your wireless network.  The display is sleek, easy to read and very intuitive.  The voice recognition works very well, but not perfectly.  If you are looking to cut the cable cord, a streaming devise like this one will be a great help.One note of caution.  Many of the apps that you can download provide programming that is redundant with Amazon Prime and each other.  It may be possible to watch a TV show or movie via app that would cost $3.99 on Amazon or be free on Amazon Prime, but cost money when viewed via app.  It can get a little confusing trying to take advantage of the lowest cost option, especially if you are not cutting the cable cord.Nevertheless, this is a piece of technology that delivers on its promise and I highly recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jeff Libert"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It wasn't updated when I got it. I updated it. It would stop and start, screen would go yellow. I'd have to restart it after messing around with the settings for 10 minutes. The tech support didn't know what they were doing to try and fix it. For $200 with the Prime, I'll keep my APPLE TV, it works much better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Campmeat"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this product!!! I also have an Apple TV so can compare the two. Both are very similar but the fire just has a myriad of options like Hulu,Netflix,spotify,pandora,prime video,and so much more where Apple TV has Hulu and Netflix but not the others however they do have apple play for music. Overall I really enjoyed the fire more than the apple.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "David"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love Amazon fire tv. Easy to navigate. My only complaint is that you need a remote to use it. The remote is very small and easy to misplace. I decided to get the fire tv remote app for my phone. Now I no longer have to worry about searching for the remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Katypie"}]
