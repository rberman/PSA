I have ordered two of these now. It has taken me sometime to get on the whole streaming tv bandwagon. I finally removed cable from my house and just use Amazon Prime TV.

We don't rely on it too much, as we have smart TVs, but we are using it with an old flatscreen that we put in our daughter's playroom.  We stream music and the occasional TV show to keep her entertained while she is playing.  It has been the only way that I can sneak away for 10-15 min to get something productive done around the house!  We are considering getting rid of the cable box in that room, as the Fire TV Stick is being used almost ALL of the time! We have been Prime members for years, and I just don't know what took us so long to try this out!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Derik Navarro"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!

I've had it for a few months and i just love it. Runs faster than a Roku 1 and it is easier to use. I just purchase my second Fire TV Stick yesterday on Prime day and i would recommend it to any one looking for a low cost streaming device. I believe that at that price there is no better device out there.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel Gandia"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is by far everything I wanted and more.

I have two Apple TV's and while I have no issues with them they don't give me access to my Amazon Prime content so when I needed a connection for another TV going with the Fire Stick was an easy choice. Has worked flawlessly, intuitive and easy to use. Setup is very simple and quick. Price is very reasonable.
