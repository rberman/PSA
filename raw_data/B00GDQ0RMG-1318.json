It seems like if this is an issue they should just have it reset every night after a few hours of no use or something.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Zach"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I've had this stick for quite awhile now. It has great features but my main issue is the glitching. I thought it must be my internet speed. Nope because I have a roku and a chromcast. Both never glitches or has to reboot. I have reboot, cleaned it, and reconnected to wifi. Still no change. I would think twice before getting this stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Leah Chanthapanya"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Versatile and fun and won't break your wallet \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeremy Lester"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got Prime T.V. in the living room, a fire stick in the bedroom, love them both !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John A.
