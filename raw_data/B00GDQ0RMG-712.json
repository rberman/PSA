[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Pathetic Design. I use the phone app as a remote - obviously I do- that is why they wrote the app plus who caries 10 remotes around when there is one on your phone. So I go on vacation - decide to bring fire stick so kids can watch tv. Here comes the SHAFT. Firestick cannot connect to vacation house wifi (obviously) until I input wifi settings... except remote control app cannot communicate with firestick because it is not on wifi.. only way to resolve is to reset to factory default. Here comes the next part of the SHAFT- cannot reset without remote. DO YOU FEEL THE PAIN???Honestly it is pathetic that the amazon team of engineers didn't think or solve this before shipping the product. Chromecast and google have accounted for this conundrum.I hate the device for failing to think of the obvious. Chromecast works beautifully in all circumstances- (PC and MAC as well).Let me guess the fire phone requires you to make a call  to amazon to unlock the phone except you can't make a phone call until you unlock it and to unlock it you need your fire stick TV remote :)I WANT MY MONEY BACK AND I AM SENDING BACK WITHOUT THE REMOTE.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alan Paulus"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Edward L Payne"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "leonard maestas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great, picks up all the apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Go, etc. The set up is fast and easy plus the interface/screen graphics are very nice. I also like the available app for the I-phone which can be used to speak the commands allowing you to use that as the remote in place of the one that came with the device.
