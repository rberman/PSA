For the first few weeks, we could stream Netflix with absolutely no problems.  About 2 weeks ago, it started \"freezing\" during play - the movie just stops dead for about 30 seconds while it \"reloads\".  This is INTENSELY annoying!!!Yesterday, while I was updating some of my software, I noticed that Google dropped a \"BETA\" update to the Chromecast.  At this point, the Chromecast will be returned as soon as possible since it now freezes up no less than 10 times per 90 minute movie.
