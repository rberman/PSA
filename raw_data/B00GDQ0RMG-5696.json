[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love it, but am disappointed that you still have to pay for some things or that some channels still require a cable provider to watch. Why should I pay a yearly fee for a service that I could easily watch with my cable provider? There is no incentive to keep it past the free trial period. I do like the convience of it but directv go enables me to watch things anywhere too. Why pay for this service and cable. I would pay for the fire stick if I didn't have to still be subscribed to cable to watch certain channels", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Marcus Hoey"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "My review is not on the Firestick other then to alert certain Comcast customers who have the Xfinity X1 System that the Firestick may not bE compatible with their modem/voice/router combination. I have the SMC and it doesn't work. I believe Amazon is negligent in not alerting us to this fact.  The Fire Stick, in all probability is an outstanding product from all the favorable reviews, but not when it won't work with your system.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "JACKR"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received it ahead of schedule which is always a plus!  Everything works good and seems pretty smooth.  There is a power adapter that is required to be plugged into the stick that I was unaware of, but not a deal breaker.

When I turned on the projector today it was on \"resetting to factory defaults\" - apparently I or my cat had bumped the buttons on it while the projector was off. So I had to go through set-up again. You can't forward through or skip the welcome to Fire Stick video.I don't want to have to climb up and unplug it to turn it off,  it needs to either go to sleep eventually or have an off option (let me know if I just failed to see it). It would suck  to have to deal with it resetting or worse, things getting purchased, just because it can't turn off and the buttons press easily.Also: I was excited about the 'fling to second screen' capability ... before realizing that is only designed to work with Fire phones and tablets. I'm pretty sure it could work with an Android app, maybe with a slight delay, I'm just not willing to buy a fire phone or tablet just for that... but if it had that for android I would buy into my own prime account (I'm on a family prime account, and I'm not the primary so I don't get video, I'm mostly using this for netflix and the occasional video rental).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elissa"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just received the Fire TV stick today.  So far, it is wonderful.  Very easy to set up and has lots of categories from movies, to games and apps and many more functions.
