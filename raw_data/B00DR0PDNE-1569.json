(YES, I installed Chromecast)I am returning this and spending the extra $60 for a Roku 3. I am very highly disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ROBERT D.

I was surprised by how simple it was to search for a video on youtube and then cast it to the chromecast. The only apps I have really used are the youtube and screen mirroring apps. There is an app called videostream for the chrome browser on your PC that allow you to stream local content (must be .mp4 based) to the chromecast. This was very handy. I would have used allcast on my phone, by I didn't want to pay for the app at the time, video stream appears to be a great alternative.I personally have no gripes about this device. Any shortcoming are typically the result of the software attempting to cast to the device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt M"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Chromecast is a life saver if you don't have a smart tv.  I have several older model televisions that only have an HDMI port and aren't \"Smart\".  So it was hard for me to connect to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, or Hulu plus etc..  Long story short, this device saved me from having to go out and purchase another tv.I am really satisfied with this device, I particularly enjoy being able to pick my movies out from an IPAD, Iphone, or android device.  Add the ability to que your content and this thing is spectacular.
