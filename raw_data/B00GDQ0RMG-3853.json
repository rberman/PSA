I am a big fan of Amazon's electronics. I wanted to have the Fire TV capabilities on a television in my spare bedroom. This little stick did the trick! The only thing that disappointed me is that it did not have the remote with the voice capabilities that the Fire TV has. It was a small price to pay by not having that option. If you want to be able to use this more for TV watching than holding a ton of games, this works perfectly!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.J. \"RJ\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works wonderfully!
