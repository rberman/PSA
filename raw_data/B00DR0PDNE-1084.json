If I decide I want to stream in another room all I have to do is unplug the power cord from the wall and the hdmi cable from the tv. It is approximately 2 inches long by 1 inch wide so it's very portable.It's easy to set up. All you need is a wifi connection and a tablet or smartphone. Set up took me less than five minutes.This device gives me a wider variety of content to stream than my smart blue ray player. All you have to do its download apps to your smartphone or tablet (ex: Netflix, HBO GO, YouTube, Pandora,  etc...) and select the chrome cast symbol in the app.(NOTE: Netflix and HBO GO both require a subscription in order to use. If you currently subscribe to hbo you should be able to access HBO GO.)The best part of the HBO GO  app is that I can access season 1 of true detectives. I am unable to access the show through UVERSE's HBO ON DEMAND.I would definitely recommend this product. You won't be disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
