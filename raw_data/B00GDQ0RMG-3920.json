I've also noticed that, while the specs tout higher performance than competing \"stick streamers\", the Fire Stick has far more issues with low bandwidth/high latency connections (eg, hotel WiFi) than the competition. Ultimately, the experience with the product has been less satisfying than using my Chromecast--especially because I can stream media on my own devices (laptop, NAS) to Chromecast, bypassing the performance of the local Internet connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

It would be nice to separate what is included with prime and what I have to pay extra for. This device offers more than my chromecast but the simplicity of chromecast keeps it relevant in this competition. One more thing, the cable channel apps (ie. A&E;, history channel)  do not work without a cable subscription so don't expect this to replace your cable tv, although the hulu and sling apps do offer some programing they can get just as expensive. So really a fun toy and worth the 40 bucks but a little disappointed about the complex user interface and cable apps not working without cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John F.

I bought this device since it had great reviews and it was reasonably price. I used to have to use my Wii to stream Netflix and my computer to stream movies on Amazon Prime. Now, it's all right there in one and the remote makes it easy to scroll through the options. The setup is very easy and I love how easy it is to move from TV to TV. This is so small and portable and would be really easy to travel with if you needed to. It just plugs into the TV's HDMI port and into the wall. I like how you can also get all kinds of different apps on there, such as YouTube and Pandora. My kids also love that they can play games on it.
