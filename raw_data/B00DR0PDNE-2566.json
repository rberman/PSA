[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I'm a big Google fan and really wanted to like my Chromecast, but ultimately it fell short.Firstly, the selection of \"apps\" that support it stands at about 16.  And some of those require a subscription to use.Secondly, the device requires a Wifi connection on the same network as the device controlling it.  So, it's not a P2P connection as I'd hoped. And despite needing that Wifi connection, it isn't made to work over the Internet (controlling/streaming remotely from a different network).Third,  and my biggest grumble, is that misleading claim that it works with Android device and Chrome browsers to stream browser tabs. Due to the serious lack of supported apps, the Chrome browser casting was what I expected to use the most.  And while it DOES support Android device and desktop Chrome browsers, it DOES NOT support the Chrome browser on an Android device.Fourth, while not a big issue for me, make sure you realize that this dongle needs a power source in addition to the HDMI and wifi connections.  That means a powered USB port on your TV or running the included cable to the nearest wall outlet.Some more advanced \"workarounds\" may diminish some of the above limitations, but there's still a lot to be desired here.On the plus side: It's small, sleek, and easy to use.  And it's cheap.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

I kept waiting for my son to come over and hook it up, since I didn't feel I could do it myself. However, when I realized he didn't have the time...after a month or so.....I managed to hook it up myself without any difficulty! Great product. However, it's only as good as the picture on the computer I am using. Good quality flicks and video clips look great on my large TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "L. Smith \"L.

It's not fully compatible with iOS and have to download multiple apps to use it. Not compatible for playing music unless you only use Pandora or Google's app. You can not view your photos or videos. It uses so much wifi that within 5 minutes it would crash and continuously disconnect. We spent more time trying to reconnect it then being able to use it. I'd rather spend money on what I know works and buy a 2nd apple tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Holly"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just an overall awesome product, can't best the price either.
