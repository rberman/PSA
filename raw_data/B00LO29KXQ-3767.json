I bought this for a second TV, tried the Fire TV Stick due to lower price and the neatness of the plug in stick vs. the stand alone Roku box. It streams really well even though it sits in the next room away from the router and not in direct line of sight. The Fire Stick is just as easy to install and setup especially if you buy through Amazon. It comes pre-registered.  I also downloaded the Fire Stick app on my Android which comes in handy if you are surfing without sufficient light, the phone stays lit to see remote buttons better.After a quick learning curve in maneuvering the menus I was watching movies within 5 minutes of installation. I cant really find any negatives on anything yet even after several weeks. Very easy to use and overall just as happy with the Fire Stick as the Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Happy in AZ"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Don't love it. I don't like that it has to be plugged into an outlet, I didn't know that before I got it. It's inconvenient because you have to make sure you have an outlet close by, and the cord is not that long. Otherwise I think it's as described. comes with the cute remote, easy to use, sign onto your amazon account and voila.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "hsaho"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazon did well by this device. It is more powerful and more feature rich that its competitors. Also with some amature/intermediate tinkering additional programs can be installed to enhance the experience.

She does not understand what exactly are the changes we would like made.

It streams well and we use it for Prime and Netflix streaming. I was a little nervous as our internet is not very fast, but it has not had any issues streaming content. My 4 stars is due to the fact that every once in a while there is no sound so we have to unplug it and replug back in to get the sound to start up again and the availability of free TV shows with Prime is crap. You have to pay for nearly every TV episode, but there are many free movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JSOM"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great easy setup", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jana l miller"}]
