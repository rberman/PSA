It was easy to set up and we love all the programming that is available. The one thing that held us back from giving this five stars is that we cannot leave it plugged in and watch local programming via the antenna. The stick creates interference which cannot be resolved without simply unplugging it from the HDMI slot. We tried to trouble-shoot on the Amazon website, but it simply denied there was a problem. Online we found that some wrap the stick with aluminum foil. We tried that but it only helped slightly. So we've resigned ourselves to unplugging it when it's not in use. Too bad there is no \"on/off\" for the unit. That might have resolved the issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jeffrey Bleijerveld"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Not quite what I was hoping for.  The Stick is not as pleasing as the Apple TV as far as the menus go and the apps.  Other than Plex, there isn't anything it offers the Apple TV or Roku 3 don't have, and the others are faster.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Jason"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "the Fire TV Stick is a great device.
