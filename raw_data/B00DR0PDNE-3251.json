It works like advertised, but after a couple weeks of use, not very impressed. I suggest people wait to see how things pan out for this device, before buying. Though the price is hard to beat, I think that $35 could go to buying something that offers more. If the Roku offered YouTube, I'd get that instead. I have a Roku, but in another rm. Got Chromecast for bedroom. No dedicated remote and no continuous streaming takes a little getting used to. But that just could be me.This is good for those who are deep into the Google lifestyle. Music on Google services works well. Pandora works good. YouTube looks great, but devices limitations may be it's failure in the future. I'm getting that Logitech review failure vibe. I use Samsung GN2, and GN10.1, which work great for casting media. I have fios, and router is on same floor, so responsiveness is quick. I really don't regret buying this thing as it is for bedroom and I do get my $35 worth. Hopefully there will be future add-on of more services, that don't hinder the hardware's performance to the point where its useless.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "B.

Haven't experienced any problems. Only bad thing relates to playing local content, as chrome does not support great many codecs and formats.
