Plenty of apps and games to choose from, and the ability to install Kodi on the unit is a HUGE plus. However, the interface is lacking in areas, particularly the sub categories (i.e. only a handful of genres shown to browse out of how many?) *Prime.  The other drawback is skipping (this may just be my unit).. sometimes when you press the remote button it reads the input as two presses instead of one.. which makes navigating a pain at times. All in all I think FireTV is on to something and I am eager to see what the next new unit brings to the table - WAY better than ROKU in my opinion.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "NoTime2Dance"}]
