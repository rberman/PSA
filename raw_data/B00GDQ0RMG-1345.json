Great for the grown ups, the kids, and best of all, IT WORKS!

The \"unofficial\" NASA app doesn't work -- it freezes 60 seconds into the video stream.  Can't watch Youtube, either.  The Youtube app is absurdly, unusably, laughably slow.  There's no internet browser unless you sideload.  Ever since this product came out, I've been waiting for Amazon to improve the app selection.  And there has been no improvement.  The apps are garbage.
