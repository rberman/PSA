[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I am not a tech savvy person and this was my first purchase of this type of device. I actually had to call my son and ask how it works and if this was a good thing to buy.  He has one and loves it, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was very easy to install!  Just plug it in, wait for the update and go!  I actually love this stick!  There are a couple of reasons I didn't give it 5 stars.  1... if I'm watching for long periods of time, it will periodically ask me if I'm still watching.  Well, yeah!  If I wasn't I would shut the TV off!  2... While watching a show or movie it periodically \"refreshes\" itself.  I'm not sure if that is the correct term, but I think  you get what I'm trying to say. This can sometimes happen 4 or 5 times during a program.  I don't miss any of the program, but it sometimes can take 20 seconds or so for the show to resume.  3... Again while watching a show it will tell me there is an update to the software and asks if I want to update it now.  In the middle of a show?  NO!  Wait until I turn it on again and then ask me!!  Again, nothing that would stop it from working correctly, just a couple of minor irritating things, but I'll deal with it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KAV417 \"KAV417\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This stick has opened up so many more options for our viewing without the expense of monthly premium channels thru our provider.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessie Schwartz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Diane Garback"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Went above and beyond", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"Calif Five\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have to give it 1 star due to amazon canceling my free prime trial.
