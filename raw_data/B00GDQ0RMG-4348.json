I bought this as a solution to not having cable. I have accounts for Netflix and Hulu Plus. Both apps crash or can't connect to the internet. It constantly says the device is not connected to the internet and then it'll drop off the network.I've had to power cycle the device itself and the modem and clear the cache from the apps and a myriad of things. At least once a day, a show I'm watching has froze where it is stuck and needs to be power cycled. Shows get stuck on ads that are stuck in the middle of downloading.I'm being very nice saying I have problems once a day. The reality is that this happens at least three times a day. VERY FRUSTRATING. I should just get the Roku box. My friend who has the Fire TV box says she has the same issues with hers. I was hoping for a small solution.Outside of the device having its issues, I love the design of the remote and it works beautifully. The price is good but you pay for what you get. I'm hoping for a firmware/app updates soon that will address some of these problems.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sunshine4all \"sunshine4all\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Only got it because it was a gift and the Kindle Fire won't work with chrome cast any more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Adam  Rader"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is tremendous, but addictive!

However, the buffering takes a little more time than expected. But that is due to the dual core processor it is equipped with.  This product is great for individuals that don't want to spend the extra money in upgrading to a smart TV or constantly having to use other devices to access apps like Netflix and Hulu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jakeenan Williams"}]
