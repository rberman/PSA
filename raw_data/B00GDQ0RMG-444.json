[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product for the price.  Purchased for my teenage daughter who loves it.  Easy to use and set up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "deb"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "In theory, this is a great, relatively cheap solution for streaming on your TV through Amazon, Youtube, Netflix, etc. In actuality, it has major problems with connections, buffering, and locking up. Since we purchased, we've watched several movies and tv shows, and haven't yet made it through one without a buffering issue. My internet/wifi doesn't seem to be the culprit here either as we've tested with other wifi-enabled devices including a smart TV and Wii. Fairly disappointed in the issues this has given us already, and would recommend looking elsewhere at this point.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "RhinoDad"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is so easy to set up and use.  We replaced a blu ray player with the Fire Stick and it is so much faster.  I hadn't seen one in use before and really couldn't envision how it works.  I am not disappointed.  The Fire Stick cost about half of what we paid for the blu ray player.  Hope to replace our other two players with the Fire Stick soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elizabeth G.

For example, I want to subscribe to Claro Video and I can not see it. My brother has Amazon Prime and can not see anything because it is outside of USA. I cant see HBO!!! I hope this problem is solved because, for now, not recommended.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jonathan Barandiaran Castro"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I received a Fire TV Stick as a gift; I don't think I would buy one even for that one person who you don't like but feel like you have to buy a gift for anyway. The interface is annoying to use and this fact is compounded by the delay between input and cursor action. The app selection is very basic and is beat by Google and Roku's devices. The only way to get any kind of value is if you have Amazon Prime, but even then your selection is limited compared to Netflix. To top everything off, this thing will barely stay on. There are times where after turning the TV on, I have to wait upwards of an hour or more for it to decide to stop constantly restarting and stay on.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Adam Britt"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This little gadget is great! I am a Prime member and I also have Netflix. There is a ton of other programming that you can get as well. I wanted it for my bedroom tv so I could watch movies when I went to bed. It hooks up so easy, just plug it in and put the tv on the right source and you are going!
