I bought it mostly for the miracast capability. I had tried a generic miracast dongle and i was unuseable. The miracast function works but you cant really use it to watch movies.... Lags and chops the audio. Netflix works ok on it.... Seems to buffer more than my gaming console does while streaming. Dont get amazon prime just for movies.... Netflix has a better selection for a buck less a month. I suppose it works ok if you just want to watch netflix or watch an incredibly expensive rental. Maybe ill try chromecast i hear it miracasts better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really like the amazon fire tv stick. the only thing that i would need to do is get more experience using it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I had it installed in less than 5 mins with no issues.
