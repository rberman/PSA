That makes it and extension of the stuff you buy, not a generalized tool. To do anything else, you have to work for it. Other than NetFlix and the like, you can use it to watch YouTube videos, but so far, that's the only \"free\" thing I've been able to do with it. What I really need is a device that would make my TV monitor display into a remote console. If I had that, I could plug this thing into any TV's HDMI input and mirror my \"desktop\" on the big screen.I like to give demos to groups for computer application use, music and images. This is limited to the number of people who can huddle around my laptop. You can get wifi products and software to do the remote console thing, but they are expensive. The \"Fire TV Stick\" has everything needed for that functionality, but it is being marketed as a captive tool for content providers. All it would take is a simple remote console app to make this product into the thing that EVERYONE would want and would consider to be standard equipment. But, no, we can't have that because the only thing the marketeers think we do with our devices is download old TV shows. We're striving to do more, so much more, and you can get rich by providing us that capability. If you don't, well, this will be just another cute gizmo that becomes obviated, then forgotten, in about a year. It's your choice, Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ALAN O.
