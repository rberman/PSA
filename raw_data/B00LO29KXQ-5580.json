When I tried to put together, I found the unit did not work. The batteries sent with it were dead.

Couldn't update it at first, and when I did update it. I couldn't get access to my prime benefits because I live outside of the US.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Updula"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Okay, let me preface this with the fact that my expectations were that this would be similar to the ChromeCast.  It is not.  This is an entirely different animal completely.Let me secondly say that if I was not already a Prime user, I might not be so thrilled with it.  But I am, so I am!  :-)Anyway WITH PRIME, this thing is amazing.  You've got instant access to all your Prime movies and music and pictures, including your libraries and cloud.Additionally, this is basically an Android device (or it appears to me to be) using the Fire framework.  So in addition to the aforementioned, you also get access to many apps, free and paid.  I haven't looked into how much it can hold, but I've downloaded several games, weather, and other apps - about 20 in total so far, all free.Finally, it didn't occur to me when I purchased, but it just makes sense that this is a RADIO CONTROLLED remote.  That means you don't have to aim it to use it, which is quite handy when gaming, or just lazy like me.  But it also means that you won't be able to integrate it with your universal remote.  So there's no volume control of your media center or TV.  You'll have to use your other remote for that.  So good and bad.I have not yet decided whether or not to get the Game Controller.  I did get the voice-activated remote, and found it very handy to have.  The voice search works well.  However if price is a concern, you should know that the Android app (and probably the iPhone app) will also give you voice control, so you might want to save a few bucks there.  I personally like having a dedicated remote control instead of having to reach for my phone and start an app.  That being said, using the keyboard on the phone is far handier than using the on-screen remote control keyboard.I did watch a couple of movies and I have to say the video quality is remarkable.  It appears to be HD, and of course, part of that will always be dependent on your internet.  However, I've been using Netflix for years, and I think the video in the Fire Stick is better.  There seem to be less artifacts and screen tearing.  Likewise, the audio is very good.  Unless you're one of those audiophiles to claims to hear better than a dog, of course.  :-)  Also, there's extremely little lag between clicking Play and the movie starting.  Netflix usually has several seconds of \"spin-up\" before it starts.  The Forward and Rewind keys jump 10 seconds forward and back, or if you hold them down, do the usual FF/RW in several speeds.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AzDayton \"- Dayton\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have terrible Internet speed (thanks Comcast). Though I'm supposed to get 100Mbps I will often see less than 1 Mbps during peak usage hours. While I can't stream Netflix on my computer during those times without insane buffering delays, somehow the fire stick never needs to buffer. Whatever sorcery is in this stick is great! Definitely worth the $39", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anonymous"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "occasionally disconnected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Yong Ku Kim"}]
