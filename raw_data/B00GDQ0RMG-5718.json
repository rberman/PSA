I was close to 3 stars but I've got some issues that I think most others will agree with, after using for a while.  When this device hibernates, it doesn't wake very well.  In regular use, randomly it is quite sluggish here or there.  The fact that this device requires you to choose something before you can start enjoying content...  it is a pain in the butt to wait for it to let you choose something at times.  Sometimes I have to actually go and unplug it and then plug it back in.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "B.
