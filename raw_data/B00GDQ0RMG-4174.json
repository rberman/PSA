The fire stick was great for about two weeks, but then it changed. It will not play some episodes, and it will lock up pretty frequently. I have updated the stick, and my internet is solid, so it's definitley the stick.  I own an Apple TV, and really hoped that the Fire stick would change my mind about a mid priced media hub. Maybe I purchased a bad stick, but regardless, I'm really not impressed.  More frustrated than happy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "scott kammer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A must have for Amazon Prime Members! It's so easy, plug it in and you're done. I have an Amazon Fire TV app on my phone so I can say what I am searching for or use the remote to type it in. I love this Fire Stick.... I can watch all my purchased movies as well as all the Prime movies.... I am so glad my kid's talked me into buying this, don't hesitate... It's a great buy :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sherri"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Misleading again, thought it had access to free TV and movies, but NO!
