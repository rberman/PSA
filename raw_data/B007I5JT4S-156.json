The nice thing is the box runs 1080p which looks great on our HD TV. The only thing we would like to see is a package vs a price for shows. It's not iTunes where you buy a show at time this is video.  We use our IPad and surf the networks and pop them up on Apple TV it's easy :) Apple rocks and very simple.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "charles j andrews"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love Apple TV - highly recommended!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jenny Rogers \"artdoggie\""}]
