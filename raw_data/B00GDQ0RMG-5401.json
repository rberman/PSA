[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this thing.  I bought it during the initial promotional launch targeted at Prime members.  I paid half price and I use this all the time.  Much better than my Chromecast since it doesn't require screen casting from my laptop and it has many more built in apps.I use it to access Espn to Go, Amazon Prime Videos, my Amazon Music, my prime photos, Netflix, and much more.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a steaming device, especially those who have Amazon Prime memberships.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pewaukee Ironman"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice product.  Sometimes it takes a while for the TV's HDMI port to reconnect once the T.V. is off.

I'm a prime member who also has Netflix and Netflix is pretty much all I use. The UI of the firestick is beautiful, but it only focuses on Amazon content.Of course, none of this comes as a surprise since its an Amazon branded device but unless you LOVE Amazon streaming services you're probably better off getting a Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark Twain \"Tony\" \"Tony\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "easy to install and use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kimberly Burts"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

Love Amazon, and the new Fire Stick just adds to the family of quality products.  Ordered this back in Oct. at promo rate - for use on 42\" Panasomic Viera TV..  What could be simpler for a long time Amazon Prime member, open box, plug into HDMI port, the Fire stick automatically set itself up to my Prime account in Jess than 2 minutes, then selected Netflix, logged into account, and several other App based Accounts, and literally, everything was ready to go.The time to connect to Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Etc is lightening fast and actually outpaces our other Smart TVs preloaded with same apps (Samsung, Vizio, & Panasonic).I have read through the various reviews and really can't understand why so many people have problems with an awesome plug and play.  Yes you must log onto specific accounts, but, that is true regardless whatever product you are using to access services.Pros:-  easy set up-  fast interface- small footprint- easy to use remote-  download Voice activated remote from App Store (android).  Super cool, and gives you another remote.Cons-  should have ordered 2 nd at Promo price for beach place-Unknowns / more to come-  games ?  Not a gamer, need to wait for daughter to take a break from new PS4-  Other Apps. Many more to explore", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Used to used my PS4 to watch amazon prime instant, this is definitely an improvement from that.
