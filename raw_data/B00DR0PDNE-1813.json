Chromecast is surprisingly small; not much bigger than your average USB flash drive.  The list of apps that are compatible with the Chromecast seems to be ever growing and you can now stream from Google Chrome on your laptop with the click of a button.  It's amazing how inexpensive this device is!! The only negative in my opinion thus far is that streaming from Chrome on an Android device requires a work around and is not compatible with Chrome on an Apple device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MK \"makdaddy\""}]
