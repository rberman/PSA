I've also noticed that if I make a selection mistake, such as choosing HD movie over non- HD,  it's not correctable - I get charged for both movies.  I've found this to be problematic with all Amazon video- if I buy several episodes of some TV show, then decide to buy the season (after watching 2 episodes)  to save money htey will charge me for the season and the two already watched episodes.  The picture on the TV is excellent but there is basically nothing to watch after 2013 which is free. So be prepared to spend money. I'm wondering if it would  be less expensive to go back to some satallite or cable at the lowest $ level.
