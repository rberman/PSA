The design layout is not particularly user friendly.  Most of the time when you search for a movie or tv title, it automatically defaults to the Amazon Prime tv service.  I don't like this, because often times, even with the Prime TV membership, you still have to pay for that title.  This is particularly bothersome when you can get that same title for free on a competing service (or a service that you have already paid for.)  The search option should pull up ALL apps that you have installed which have the title available.One of the things that I do like, however is the downloadable Fire TV stick app for Android users.  This app has a voice search feature.  It is much, much, faster than a manual search.  It is free, so you save on having to buy the voice remote.  My review would have probably been a bit higher if they had the HBO2GO app which I understand should be out this Spring.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jamman62"}]
