[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I just purchased Amazon Fire TV and I love it! Easy installation. Recommend buying the USB cable ( 5.99 extra ). Navigation is easy and the voice command really works with the remote. Was a little disappointed that so many movies are for purchase but with Amazon prime there is no purchase for their movies. Great screen saver scenes from around the globe. After viewing my Amazon Fire TV, my neighbor ordered one for her family.

The Amazon Fire TV holds its own with the best of them.For gamers, the Amazon Fire Controller is a must have accessory and adds even more value to the Fire TV. Gaming works great on it, but the storage limitation causes a few issues,  especially for those who want to play some Grand Theft Auto on their new device.Overall, the Fire TV is off to a great start, and will only get better with time as improvements are made.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Troy Bishop"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Hello beautiful Amazon product \u0107\u00e1\u00c7\u00df\u00e4 applications and games no problem in loading Is the device does not work, but America Mhzh problem because I of Libya ......
