It works for all HDMI TV hotel internet setups, even the password portal types. Once you choose the hotel wifi, it pauses for a minute or 2 as if it wont connect...then the hotel login screen opens with no problem. Works great. A must have.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adam Lomax"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "May I first day, I was very excited for this product.  Unfortunately, it has continually froze while watching Hulu, Netflix, and Sling TV.  Additionally, it disconnects from the Internet fairly regularly.  We upgraded our internet to 50 Mbps, and it still froze.  When we watch on our Wii, it never freezes.  I contacted customer service, and it didn't help.  It was a waste of an hour, while the lady had me reset and unplug every device.  I recommend selecting another product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kyle Lindey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my fire stick. Easy to install.

We brought it to the marina where we keep our sailboat, and had no problem using it.  Since I was bragging about all of the prime movies we could watch, my friend purchased one as well.  Actually, my sister also bought one.  The fire stick turns your tv into a smart-tv without the price.

Wouldn't be much of a problem, but then I hear about it...constantly...which is a problem.  This device will not stretch the image to fill the television screen.
