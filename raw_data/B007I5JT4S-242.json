Airplay works great.  Apple apps work rather seamlessly with the product, but non-apple apps can use some work (namely Netflix).Cons: The main reason I'm giving the product 3 stars is because of its connectivity.  I have it set up in my great room downstairs while my router is upstairs in the office.  After setting the product up with the network and using it with Netflix, I would continually get dropped connections.  After some time in the forums I found that setting my router to a static channel would help to resolve that issue, which it did to some extent.  After being on for several days, the Apple TV would lose connectivity and would have to be restarted before I could resume streaming.  When I had my Roku2 xd set up in the same location, I wouldn't have the same connectivity issues as the Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "n sant"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Work well", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TX Buyer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE this streamer.

Downloads take forever. Up to 40 minutes for an hour long show? It keeps telling you to download a lower resolution. It constantly give you \"error loading\" messages. Don't bother trying to watch a movie on a Saturday night with Apple TV unless you want your night ruined. Worst piece of crap ever! I have 3 rokus and those work so much better than this piece of junk.
