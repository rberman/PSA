After Geek Squad installation, I could not access my iTunes music & videos from the iCloud.  Spent over 40 hrs. on the telephone with Rolanda Mudd, Apple Senior support specialist which was like chasing the wind and useless.  On the fourth trip, Geek Squad tech specialist was finally able to figure out that the Apple TV was not compatible with Windows 8.1 and only enabled my music and videos my manually copying them from my external hard drive and reinstalling them to my computer after erasing all of what Apple support had done.  And it took 6 hrs. to accomplish.  Don't waste your money if you are using Windows on your computer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jack"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My partner and I have been using our Blu-ray player and gaming systems to watch Netflix, Hulu Plus, and others, which didn't have access to MLB TV.For a late birthday present I bought this for both of us to share, and we are very happy with it-  we have mediocre Internet speeds but that does not stop us from getting excellent quality HD streaming.
