We encountered a problem early on when we turned on the fire TV: only to find the TV displaying a blue screen message of \"HDCP unauthorized. Content disabled\" whenever we tried to play a movie/show on Netflix or on Amazon video.  After trying to replug the fire TV stick and testing it out again, and having the same error message, we went to the Amazon support link.  Customer service was extremely helpful and patient.  He (the Amazon customer representative) had us force stop each application in the fire TV's settings menu and then doing a content clearing of our data, which resetted everything and made the streaming display correctly again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Mel Bridges"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is by far my favorite electronics purchase in years. It takes your ordinary TV and turns it into a smart TV without having to use your laptop or phone to cast things like you would with the Chromecast. I like be not having another box by my TV like a roku or apple TV. I also downloaded the remote app for my phone and I LOVE it. Great buy, highly recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "KJ914"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "**Updated Review on 12/8/14**I originally only gave the stick 2 stars.  I am still unable to get the Fire Stick to work in the East side of my 2nd floor but was able to use it on the West side.  I have moved the router and did all the trouble shooting but it just will NOT accept a signal through that wall - My Roku works fine on the East side though.  The reason I have updated my review is to be fair to those who are looking at this product.  I have two smart TV's one in the basement and one on the main floor - The fire stick is quicker and has a smoother transition from screen to screen (especially with photos on the cloud)than the smart TV's do.  If you have a clean line of site with minimal obstruction between your television and router I highly recommend buying the Fire Stick for $39 before buying a Smart TV for $800.  I was amazed at how quick the stick was and how much it can do.  I have uploaded over 3 thousand photos and videos to the Amazon Cloud service and can view them on any TV in the house, and on the TV with the stick the photos transition as smooth as if you were watch them on a DVD. I believe this is worth the money and quite cost effective... Just be aware of the limitations when it comes to homes of certain construction (thick concrete, ICF, Brick and so on).**Original Posted week of 12/1/14** I was excited to get this at just $19 on the pre-order special.  It finally got here yesterday.  I bought it for a bedroom on the second floor.  On the second floor all of our devices work on wi-fi.  I have a roku in the spare bedroom, we have used laptops, and the wifi works on our phones on the second floor.  I even have my desk top computer working off wifi on the second floor.  However the Fire Stick does NOT work on the second floor.  At first I thought it was a faulty stick so I took it to the main floor and put it into that TV and it works great there.  And I would love to use it but I have a smart TV in that living room so I don't need it there.  So I guess I will have to either use the fire stick as a very light paper weight in the office or move my wifi router up a floor.  I haven't decided which I will do yet.  So this was a big disappointment.  Even with the HDMI extender (which they say boost the signal) the stick would say connected but with problems.  If you do not have a smart TV or other streaming the fire stick would be a very cost effective device for you (even at the $39 price range) but if you already have something that works well for you then don't bother with this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Gerald Weis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Quick and responsive (faster than my Roku). Nice interface and well-integrated with Amazon. Parental controls are a plus.

A majority of the currently supported apps can be found on the product description so check if you are concerned  it might not do everything you want.  The ability to sideload apps makes this small dongle a pretty powerful little computing device.  I had XBMC up and running in about 10 minutes and was streaming hd content over a local network without delay.  People complaining about HDMI not powering the device obviously can't read and don't understand why that would be a bad idea.  While HDMI does have a 5v power pin, it really isn't intended to power a device.  The power pin is used primarily to trigger signals... like when to turn on a tv.  Even if the 5v could work as a power source, it wouldn't be good for powering a strong device without a battery.  While 5v can charge a phone,  it is still just supplying a small amount of power compared to a 12v wall adapter.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Mazzoccs"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Have had this for a couple weeks now and I love it.
