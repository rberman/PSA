[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I like the Fire TV Stick. User interface is easy to use, and there are a lot of shows that are included with Prime membership. I am slightly annoyed that all the movies or shows my kid wants to watch are for rent for at least 3.99. This is certainly not Amazon's fault, but it somewhat defeats the purpose of Prime.Will continue to use The Fire TV Stick and aside from my kids choice in (Premium) shows, love the product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "fwwalker \"fwwalker\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fabulous, especially if you have Amazon prime!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephanie"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "50 % of the the it's slow to stream", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert Long"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a vary good product for us to watch movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bill Naugle"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Good quality.
