[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "First one I got wouldn't pair with remote. Tried putting remote 2 inches from Fire TV Stick, using the HDMI extender, not using the HDMI extender. putting fresh batteries in, NOTHING.Edit:Amazon was going to send me a replacement, but at the last minute, I decided to try it out on the living room TV. It worked! Not sure if it was Bluetooth interference in the bedroom, but it works great in the living room. I have upgraded the rating to 4 stars. The interface works, if a little cluttered and the loading speeds are faster than loading similar apps on my PS3 or Xbox 360, plus it uses less electricity to just have the Fire TV Stick plugged in. Audio and Video quality are the same as those consoles. The ability to play basic android games is neat. Some games work on the Fire TV Stick Remote, but obviously you would get benefit (better controls) if you buy the Amazon BT Gaming Controller, or just use a BT one you have laying around.I haven't tested if a PS3 or Xbox 360 controller would sync to the Fire TV Stick.The stick does get hot after a while, and despite what the message said about not supplying enough power from the TV's USB, it has been working just fine the last 4 hours of testing. I haven't experienced any wifi connectivity issues either.This device has essentially turned my dumb TV into a SMART one!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cool Spot"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Was received as a gift.

It's super easy to set up and use.  I watch a lot of videos from Prime Video and the interface with Fire TV is better than any other platform.  We have had almost no issues with the streaming and the picture quality is gorgeous.  I'm totally spoiled now and hate to go back to another device to catch up on Game of Thrones!2 minor items keep me from giving it the 5th star-It's super easy to order and pay for new videos, which I love for me, but my daughter has rented Annie 3 times now!  I'm sure there is a setting I can change, and maybe I should just buy the movie, but I haven't yet.Also, there's tons of options for other apps to enable watching video from other sources, but I still need to have an account with a cable/satellite provider to use them (including for a channel like ABC).  I'm looking forward to the day that I don't need a month cable account and can just pay for the TV I want to watch.  I think Fire TV is getting close to the a la carte approach, but not everyone else is there yet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kim"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I purchased the Fire TV Stick so I could get Sling TV on my TV. I have a few Apple TVs and find them to be good devices, but they do not have a Sling TV app.The FTS would not recognize my remote during the onboarding process. It took me a few different attempts with unplugging it and plugging it back in to get it to work. The device also needs to have a power outlet VERY close to the HDMI port in the TV. I could not use the device with my TV in my living room because the power outlet was too far away.The UI is sluggish and unresponsive. And, the biggest disappointment, is that the Sling TV app often does not work and returns an error. Overall it was not a good experience. I would not recommend this device to someone else.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "tho kieu"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "On the road for work almost every week! This has been a game changer - not having to watch Everything on my iPad or sit through random TV programming / commercials! My only issue his the iPhone App doesn't locate the fire stick everytime so I do have to make sure that remember the remote. Other than that - great purchase and would fully recommend it to anyone that travels for a living!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Derek"}]
