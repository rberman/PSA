I have an app on my phone that I can use around my house to check internet speed and when I put it in the same vicinity as this, I get 40+ Mbps download speeds.  I also use my XBox 360 wirelessly on the same TV using the Amazon app with no issues.  The video quality is constantly switching from HD to SD or stopping altogether to buffer the video because this device seems to not sustain a good connection.When it does work, it is pretty fast and easy to use.
