And even with our pathetic little router, it still rarely has an issue with streaming. The only thing I would say was a surprise (as they do not show it in the commercials or advertisements) is that you still have to plug it into a power source. Thankfully it is small though, so it doesn't add too much mess around the TV. Definitely worth it, especially if you are a Prime member.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KaeleighBee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's great!
