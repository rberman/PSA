Everytime I attempt to cast the page i am streaming, it immediately disconnects.

I picked it up for $25 during a sale, but $35 is still cheap compared to Apple TV or Roku.- Able to stream from Google Play, Netflix, Youtube.- Google Cast allows to stream webpage open on your computer- Hidden and out of sightCons:- No physical remote aside from smartphone or tablet- 2.4GHz band, no option for 5GHz- Lack of ability to stream a video from the HDD of your computer- Basically does what a smart TV already doesOverall: I enjoy using Google Chromecast because its simple and straight forward to use. The lack of 5GHz for the wifi does bother me a bit since it is located far from my router and there is a ton of interference in my neighborhood. However, I haven't seen any drops in framerates while using it for youtube and netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alex"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I found four things:1.  Chromecast will not necessarily work with your wireless router.  On some routers, you will have to change your router settings, and on others Chromecast won't work at all.  (In my case, the router that came with my Verizon FIOS cannot work with Chromecast.)  Unfortunately, you won't learn about this until after you've tried to install Chromecast.  In any event, be sure you are comfortable with the thought of reprograming your router before you buy this.2.  It is not the stand-alone piece of hardware the photo suggests, which makes Chromecast look like a powered USB drive.  In fact, it has an external power supply and a cord that that plugs into the \"top\" of the device.3.  It is not as easy to set up as Google suggests, and Google's instructions for installation are too brief to be of much help.  You may need to find a YouTube video to walk you through it.4.  As others have mentioned, Chromecast does not let you stream your laptop content to the TV.  Instead, it is a means of streaming the content of selected providers, such as Hulu, Netflix, etc.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "GSS \"User 56\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I ordered one for every TV.  When I pull up the broadcast button, it lists them all if they are powered up.  However, many times it says the content is not available for streaming and just blacks out the screen.  It's really hit and miss what works, and what doesn't.  For those who say you cannot cast Amazon Prime, yes you can as long as you cast the tab your have it open in.  It will cast nearly everything when it is working properly.  The problem I have is that half the time, it takes on a mind of it's own and decides NOT to work.  It's VERY annoying, as it usually happens when I am trying to share something with someone, and may be in a bit of a hurry.  This thing is not yet ready for prime time.  I primarily use my ROKU to broadcast stuff from YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon now.  This collects dust on the living room TV, and RARELY gets used on the others, unless my daughter tries to watch something from her Ipad.Also, I have seen several people say there is no Chromecast extension available for Android.  Yes there is.  I have it.  It is in the Play Store.You cannot broadcast tabs from a tablet or phone, but you can from a Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.  Chromecasting from a tab in Chrome allows you to view your desktop, as well as Amazon Prime, etc on your TV.  There is no Prime app as of yet.Tablets and phones work GREAT with the corresponding apps with this thing WHEN IT WORKS.I say save your money.  Unless you just have $35 to blow and want to take a chance it will work for you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Frank N. Stein"}]
