[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Had some initial troubles with this stick not playing DHCP material, was solved somehow after a random operation of plugging unplugging, replugging....  A few chants, then plugging and unplugging and bam!  Worked great for 2 months.  Now, Hulu doesn't work, audio is fine and ocassionaly some random screen shots pop up.  25 mb download, everything else works (crackle, netflix, act). Preordered this to replace my roku 2, now just plain irritated, don't have another 2 hours tonight to call support and unplug things in a secret random order....  Almost got 2 stars for the remote being tough as nails!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Gregory M.

I have two kindles and a fire box which works perfectly on everything, and I still use one of the first fire kindles that amazon came out. But when I put the fire stick on my music to bring my list up. It keeps going around and around trying to load my music list. I contacted amazon customer service about the problem, and was on the phone with them  for 1 hour and 16 minutes trying to explain to every person that they transferred me to what my problem was. Streaming works great on the fire stick, I can bring up my video's, and any movie I can watch with ease. This is why I gave it three stars, and I thought I was being generous. When I gave amazon a feedback, and told them exactly what had happen. They said that some people where experiencing the same problems, and they were working on it. That was February 1 2015 and I haven't heard anything else. So to anyone that is thinking about buying the fire stick this problem could come up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "laredo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great! easy setup", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GG"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We already had the Fire TV and had enjoyed using it so we ordered the Fire stick for a TV in another room.
