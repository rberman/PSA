However I can watch HD TV online through NBC Sports or HBO. In the past I would have to hook my laptop in through HDMI, but that meant no multi-tasking. Now I can stream through Chromecast to my TV (as a Chrome tab or through the HBO GO phone app). So I get HD TV without paying any extra and I can use my laptop at the same time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "MidwestSCC.com"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is my second unit.  Had problems with this one during installation.  Need to get into to the router and remove the guest network in wifi to make this and the old units accessible.  But with more and more apps with Chromecast built in this is great for the price.
