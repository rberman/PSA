[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I had high hopes for the Fire TV Stick. It's at least as good as the Roku, so I'll give them that. But I just can't seem to get past the basic user experience as compared to the super polished Apple TV interface. The only time I use my Fire stick is when I need to stream from my prime account. If I'm watching Netflix or listening to music, I'm all about the Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.

It was easy enough to install, but after the second time using it, I kept getting an error saying I was not connected to the Internet when I was.. Changed to port, which worked for about five minutes, then kept buffering so it was a little annoying.  Changed the port again, so hoping the third time works.

We realized it needed to be plugged into the wall and into an HDMI slot. The remote was hard to open to load the batteries. But all that aside we're very happy with our purchase. So much content available. The remote and navigating is easy. You can also get a Fire Stick smartphone app remote control that has voice control. The choices are amazing!  Traveling with Kids, PBS Kids, Amazon videos, and much more. We are still exploring. I plan on using the fitness prime videos to change up my workout routine. For the price and the trusted name behind it you can't go wrong!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JC mom \"SHeller\""}]
