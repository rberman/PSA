[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Amazon Fire TV Stick, met and surpassed our expectations.  We received the Fire Stick as a gift at Christmas, we just set a couple of settings plugged it in a PRESTO, connections to our PRIME TV, Video and music, plus Netflix, HULU, games and more.  Add to that, the Fire TV App for our Android phones (pretty sure there is an Apple one as well) and know we can view our phone pix and video, as well!  Just perfect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patrick Brown"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "i have the best internet service available, and still i keep getting messages tha I need more.

I expected my computer based programs (Hulu for example) to be channeled to my TV. They are not.  Most if not all items require a  subscription and if the App isn't one that fire has enrolled you are out of luck. That said,  it does what it does well. Instructions for use are non-existent as with so much these days, but I got it figured out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ken Gruber"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE it !
