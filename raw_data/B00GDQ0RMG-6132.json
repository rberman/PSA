Also, really hard to figure out how to get the back panel of the remote open to insert the batteries.  Manual give no clue that you need to press down in order to slide the cover off.  Almost sent the product back as I was stumped - and I am a guy who is very familiar with tech products.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gary Streuter"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have had my Fire TV Stick for a few days now and so far, the experience has been great! When setting it up, the MAC address was easy to find, at the right of the available wifi networks. This is a big deal for me because my university limits the number of wireless devices students can have connected. I have to provide this to IT before it will connect to the internet in my dorm. I'm glad amazon made this so easy to access!I really like the interface. It's more updated than Apple TV and more attractive than Roku. It has specific areas for prime content so it's easy to find the shows and movies that are free to stream for prime members. The Netflix app has been updated and now supports profiles within the app. This way, I have recommendations specifically for what I watch, not everyone else who watches. I considered purchasing a Fire TV before the stick was released and one of the main reasons I didn't was the lack of Netflix profiles support.It really is a great value for the price. It's navigation compared to Apple TV requires less clicks to get to what I want to watch. I prefer it to the Chromecast because I don't have to start playing content and then send it to the TV. I'm considering getting a game controller so I can use it's gaming ability to the fullest.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Tristan Wolfe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!
