The speed of the Amazon app is fast, some of the others are still as slow as the ones built into my smart tv.

The screen seems gray. There is bug in the networking. Sometimes I can't do anything because it says the network in not connecting but the network works fine on my other devices.

Set-up was very easy, and was able to register my Netflix and Hulu accounts with it. However, when I tried to watch a Prime movie, it would pause every couple of minutes, which meant I had to keep hitting play to continue watching. That was pretty irritating. I was able to stream the same movie to my Chromecast from the computer, so I knew it wasn't my Internet connection. I was also able to watch Netflix movies and Hulu on my Chromecast with no issues.I called Amazon, and the rep said to reboot the router. I did, and it seemed to work fine after that. Time will tell, I guess.I like the simple remote, the interface is nice, but I just hope the pausing doesn't continue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Hoosiermama \"Mary Loveless\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Over all the amazon fire stick is a great product, but it is in its infancy. Navigation is great with only a few quirks. Great video playback quality and speed, easy navigation, and very easy acess to amazon prime content.Pros:fast and easy navigationGreat video qualityIntuitive and beautiful UIDecent content.Con's:No way to attach external devicesNo access to Vudu movie serviceNo access to google play moviesWelcome how to video (that shows you how to use the remote) play AFTER you have to use the remote to set it up. Which is fine, but for some users might not be helpful.Extreamly limited apps not much to choose from\"Fling\" feature only works from fire products. No IOS or Android devices.In closing. Amazon fire stick is a Fantastic device for the price, but is still quite limited in ability. Great for Hulu, Netflix, and prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "thomas l stewart"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought this through an Amazon Prime introductory offer at a very low price, and am pleased so far.  It is definitely faster than my old Roku box, although there are fewer channels available on the Fire TV as of now.

I've had it for last 2 days and its running flawlessly; my other device had connectivity issues due to location of router and this one seems to be doing much better, I guess its due to its Dual band capability.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It works great!

Streaming is quick and playback is excellent. No issues thus far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "bill aucoin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was excited for this product and it didn't disappoint.  It's easy to install/navigate and works off your existing WiFi.  Amazon, Hulu, Netflix etc... all in one place makes for convenient access to all your favorite shows.  If I was to seek an improvement it would be on the streaming side.  I live in an older house in the country so my internet isn't overly fast.  Streaming video works fine on the computer but with the Fire Stick it buffers quite a bit.  Dropping the resolution doesn't seem to help.  That being said, even with slow internet, it's not been that much of an issue.  Still an A+ in my book.  This is a great resource for someone looking to get rid of cable/satellite.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Nate93077"}]
