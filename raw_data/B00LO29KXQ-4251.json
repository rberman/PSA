But, after a week, the fire stick has proved pretty useless. It doesn't connect to a verified network - constantly failing and asking for the password. It also freezes constantly. I was really excited about streaming new content but I'd rather go back to my TV's apps than hurdle this thing. It also requires a a power source plugged into it which, is just kinda lame.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nasca"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!  Not only is everything in HD.  There is such a broad spectrum of apps to use.  It's easy to install and navigate.

I also really like the fact that EVERYTHING came with the purchase (i.e., the stick, an HDMI cord, an HDMI/stick extension, power cable, batteries and remote). Here's what I was not happy with: 1) Trying to open the remote back to install the batteries took nearly 45 minutes! I had to use a paring knife to separate the edge in order to push down and then pull the back out. You might want to have users of different age groups with dis/abilities test the ease of handling; and 2) send better instructions for use of the device. It is silly to purchase this, then be expected to buy a Fire Stick/TV manual for $8.99.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "drcmb"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I'm sure this will be a good purchase.  However, haven't been able to use it yet since the condo we're renting at the beach doesn't have wifi strong or fast enough for the stick to work without buffering every 30 seconds or so.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paula"}]
