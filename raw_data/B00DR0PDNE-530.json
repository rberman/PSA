I say it keeps getting better mostly because of the new cool things I find that it can do.  For the most part my wife and I use it for netflix.  The convenience level is amazing.  I don't have a bluray player so this is what I use to stream movies and videos to my TV.  Its great having it all on my phone since I lose my phone a lot less than I lose my remote.I have had to purchase two of these because my 1 year old has decided that he likes ripping cords out of the TV which caused my first one to break.  On my second one I used the short HDMI extender that comes with the chromecast and now my kid just unplugs it from that rather than breaking the pins.  So thanks for that too google!Forever yours, Murdolph", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Murdolph"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Either you love it or hate it...I love it....but its not apple tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Don"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works for the most part.

And I'm very familiar with computer, my brother is an IT tech and has taught be lot, more than the average computer user would know. However, Chromecast is just not user friendly. The support number was hard to find, I was on hold for a long time and still figured out how to fix it on my own because Chromecast's own technicians were less knowledgeable about the problem I was having that I was. I know how to modify my router setting, I knew that my router was compatible. They were very quick to want to write my problems off and just send me an email with a set of instructions to follow. And once I amazed them that I had already followed all the instructions they wanted to email me, they literally didn't know how to help me.Even after I fixed the problem with the router, Chromecast is still very spotty and doesn't work properly most of the time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kristen Lerch"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is the first device i bought that 'casts' content from one of my devices to a TV...this thing is awesome!
