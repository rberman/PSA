Hubby works a lot, son is away at college, I am studying in school, so we rarely watch TV. But when we do we use sling TV on the amazon fire stick. the cost is $20 /mo compared to satellite at $120/month and the prices keep going higher. Even adding Hulu and Netflix are more affordable and we can watch on our time. We are very pleased!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KatH"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I was so happy with the amazon fire stick that i wanted to replace all my rokus.
