Set up only took a few minutes and I was ready to watch a movie.  It is such a good deal; big performance for a low price.  Truly worth what it cost.  I would recommend it highly; great way to watch movies and with the many Amazon Prime free movies, you can't beat the deal.  So glad I got it and will really enjoy using it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Frances"}]
