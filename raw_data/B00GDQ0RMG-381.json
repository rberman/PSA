[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "It has been a great trade-off buying into the Fire Stick and cutting the cable cord.  There are plenty of apps to support us in making the trade possible however... obviously Amazon Prime, but Netflix and HBO Go really made a huge difference.Be careful of accidentally buying content you don't intend to buy.  That part is way too easy and really what kept this review from being 5 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marcus Ealy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works very good.
