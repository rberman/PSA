Access to my prime account and watchlist was seamless and I didn't need to add any additional login details.  I do like the phone app.  It takes away the need to by another remote for voice recognition and you can use the phone's keyboard to type as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian Waddell"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I already own a chromecast, a roku, a wii and a smart TV. I was excited because this had mentioned it would be faster than the rest and the price point was right.Unfortunately, the interface is very difficult to use and aimed at guiding you to amazon products.

I love that it was inexpensive and is small, but it constantly drops the connection. There are times when a show i am watching on Netflix simply abruptly drops to a static gray screen. Unplugging the device from the TV for several minutes seemed to fix that problem, but, like many people describe, about an hour into another show, my signal drops. My Fire Stick is about 24 inches away from my wifi router. I'm really frustrated with this thing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Steph Mom \"Steph\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works quite well", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "johnsona698"}]
