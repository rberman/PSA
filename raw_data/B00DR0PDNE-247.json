I have it on constantly as it does provide a set of nice background images and the time as well so when you're not streaming to the device it's still a functional piece of tech. I'm actually thinking about buying a few more for the other TVs around my house and just getting rid of cable and just sticking to my Internet service since I'm able to stream all of my favorite shows straight to this simple device via Netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "camper ruybal"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's okay, but it should really have a way to link your whole computer screen to your TV.
