I use it mostly for streaming movies and tv.  To this point it has worked flawlessly and I can control it from my iPhone.  It has a clear picture and no lag except for when I use Hulu.  The only thing that I don't like is that it has to stay plugged in.  I understand it and it doesn't change my opinion that this is an excellent piece of technology, but I would like it if I didn't have that extra cord.  I recommend this for everyone.

I've had Netflix and Huluplus for several years but the upgrade automatically received by using the Fire TV Stick is worth every penny. Navigation is much easier; I'm getting more out of the pay services for the same price. Movie options seem endless. Additional channel options including games like pinball are the icing on the cake.
