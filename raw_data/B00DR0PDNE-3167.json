I like the fact that I can choose and play a Netflix movie from anywhere in the house, that it doesn\u2019t tie my phone to the TV and that I can use almost any mobile device (Tablet, laptop, chromebook, ipod, smartphone, etc\u2026) to choose a movie.  The only downfall is that if I forget to play a movie, the Chromecast home screen creates screen burning.  It already happened on my LED tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "ichuyi"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Can't use your phone as a WiFi connection.
