The videos ran without stopping, when I paused, it paused, and when I exited, it exited. The remove is very simplistic and I may train one of my smart remotes to immulate the fire stick remote. The only drawback is the need for more power to run the stick. The cord is a little short for what I needed, but it works.  I like this enough to buy another unit for my other TV set. I would recommend this to everyone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "hope coman"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far so good. I have a playstation 3 for my livingroom but my bedroom was always lacking. Now with Amazon Fire Stick i'm set. I have only used the Prime features but even that has been awesome because now I am really taking advantage of this yearly membership. Being able to use my kindle fire as well as the provided remote is cool. I will say it was hard to get it to set up on the wireless since the box is in the livingroom. Once I connected it directly to the tv that also had the internet box connected then I retried the tv in the bedroom I haven't had one issue with connectivity. Still very happy I jumped on the deal when I did. Discovering new free to watch tv shows and movies everyday.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Antlove30"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Finally got my Fire Stick set up. Being a Prime member made the setup easier. I have it set up in the bedroom tv so I can catch some shows before I get to sleep. Have no issues so far with the exception of Hulu still unable to stream over the HDMI cable. Other than that small issue, it works great.Update!: Hulu now works on the Fire Stick. The HDMI extender was the issue. Might want to be something to look into Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Domingo Zapata"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very easy to set up.  Love the simplicity but it packs tons of features.  The reason why I did not gave it a five star rating is due to the fact that you cannot play purchased movies in YouTube.  I purchased The Interview in YouTube but you cannot play it in the Fire TV Stick.  I could play it in my PS3, Smart Blu Ray players that have YouTube app and my PC, but not on the YouTube app in Fire TV stick.  I hope it is just a matter of either a firmware or an app patch/upgrade soon.  Other than that, it works like a charm.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "J.
