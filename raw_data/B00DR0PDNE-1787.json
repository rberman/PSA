The videos get cropped too.Things to note:Projecting a tab works fine. Although, you need a good machine to keep up. So, using a light weight tablet does not work too well.Did not try playing any local content from my laptop/tablet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Karl Buhariwala"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Exelente", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jovel Torres"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "An awesome piece of hardware.
