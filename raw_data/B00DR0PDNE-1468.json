We had trouble setting it up initially as you have to have something on your router disabled in order to make it work. We weren't able to finagle that from our ipad, so we called our internet provider and they righted that issue in about 30 seconds (there are also lots of videos online that show you how to fix that yourself, but we don't have a computer and thus, we can't access our router. Perhaps there is a way to do that through an ipad, but we didn't bother). What I also love about this is that you can use your ipad for other things while you are streaming a show/movie. Also, a surprise to us was that your streaming device's battery isn't drained when you are watching your movie/tv show. Very neato.This little $35 device is saving us from a $150 per month cable bill. We just pay for our internet ($42/month, which we would have regardless) and a Hulu+ subscription ($8/month).
