[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Just plugged it in today and the jury is still out. While we used Pandora for a bit and are excited about the Prime access on it, it lost it's connection repeatedly today to our wireless router. It also seems limited on apps. HBO Go is coming soon though so that will help. Going to take some additional time with it to really see if it wows but initial impressions are \"meh\". Can't beat the price though!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Gregory M Eid"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Short and simple, its an average device. The interface is too \"Amazonized\" I get it, its their product, but my unhealthy TV watching habits are spread out across multiple channels.

I do love it. It's got a crisp, clear image. I can stream my American Horror Story purchases (Can't do that with the Chromecast and Wii streaming is fuzzy).Seems like a great little tool. The other night I turned on the TV and it the Fire TV Stick wouldn't power up, so I just used my Chromecast, and the next night the Fire TV Stick was fine.Glad I jumped on the $19 deal. Worried that I might lose the tiny little remote though and there's no app for my iPhone yet.Only one complaint- HBO Go is an optional app in the stick, BUT not if you are a Comcast/Xfinity customer, which kind of stinks. I have to use the Go app on my iPhone and stream it through my Chromecast, which is a little annoying.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MomTo2"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is an awesome product! I have 4 TVs in my house. 2 Google Chrome, 1 Roku 2, 1 Apple TV and now 1 Fire TV Stick. I can tell you the remote control is pretty cool. Some people prefer to control from their phone, but since I have found my iPhone 6 gets stuck at least once per day with the Chromecast, being able to manage with not phone is pretty good. Quality and Speed is amazing and the UI is really good. I can do a search and will send me to the streaming service that has the content and you can go from there. Highly recommended. BTW, I also have Netflix, Prime and Hulu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "LGuiriga"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I do not like this product.
