Very cool feature and as such its being advertised.Tried it out, it doesn't work with any of the windows devices. Looking on the web, searching twitter it seems I am not the only one who expected to get it and never did.Amazon advertisement is misleading - just don't buy this if this feature is important to you.Beyond that, tried the device on two TV's with only half success- I guess this is also a standard issue? \ud83d\ude09", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Bird \"Not sure what I was thinking\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I enjoy how many things are on the fire sick.

Not a big deal, but short sighted on the developers. Also the 90 degree angle on the power plug that the UBS cable goes into would mean that plugging it into a surge protector would require it to be plugged into the bottom spot or it would take up two spots. Again, not a big deal, but short sighted on the the developers. Once hooked up the setup was easy which was nice. After that, things went down hill. After downloading the Netflix app and getting that up and running the video quality is rather poor. Within a five minute span, it can go from great quality to bad to OK and then back to great to OK and then bad again in no particular order. This happens continuously... never ending. Annoying when trying to watch a movie. Has nothing to do with my internet or wireless network as other wireless streaming devices (four of them) do not have this issue. Thinking this might have something to do with Netflix, I tried Amazon Prime Video and had the same results.The Stick also lags from buttons pressed on the remote. You can push a button and nothing happens to you push it again and again and again.... then the Stick responds to each button press scrolling past what you were actually wanted to select. Dumb.I was hoping to recommend this to people new to online streaming, but I defiantly will NOT be. This would be a horrible first experience in streaming due to the video quality. This would defiantly turn new people off from streaming video.Maybe things will improve with time, but who knows. Until it does, the ONLY THING I would use this for would be taking with on trips and still being able to watch streaming TV at places that have WiFi. Even then, I might not take the time to hook it up.I purchased it for $20. If I paid full price, it would be getting returned immediately.*If things get better I will update my review*", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "EB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I ordered two of these during the pre-sale event and I am glad I did! I LOVE LOVE LOVE them! I purchased it mainly to watch Netflix. We have been using a Wii for years and it was a pain with slow response time and a lot of freezing. The Fire TV Stick has not frozen once and the response time is immediate. Streaming videos on Netflix and other apps on the device do not take a long time to load. Most items only take about half a second. .Pairing is awesome! I love that I can be watching a video on YouTube on another device and then switch to TV without having to search for the video. The only drawback is that the YouTube app loads kind of slow. Even with the slower load time, it's really nice, for me, when watching recipe or how to videos to be able to see it on a bigger screen instantly.The overall interface could use a little improvement. For the way that I use it, it doesn't flow well, but I still give the device 5 stars. Since I bought it during pre-sale, I think it is an awesome buy for the money. At full price, I am not sure since their are other devices that can do similar things and more. However, for a user just wanting to watch TV on Demand, Netflix, Hulu and such, this is perfect with it's features.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marcina"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "What a GREAT product! Purchased this for when I traveled and used a wifi hotspot instead of my home wifi. I provided the hotspot provider the wifi MAC address of the Fire stick and I was in watching in minutes.
