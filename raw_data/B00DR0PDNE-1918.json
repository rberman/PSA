I've spent over 6 months with it now, so am able to provide a comprehensive review of it.1. Installation of this could not be easier. If you have a flat screen tv (mine is from 2011) with an HDMI port in the back, you can set this up in less than 10 minutes. If you are an avid user of google products and have a google account, it will be even easier. I use gmail and android, so this was a piece of cake.2. The screensavers that display when the chromecast is not in use are beautiful. While this may not seem like a big deal, it's worth noting in comparison to Roku or blu ray players.3. This is great at a few things - not all things. Streaming Netflix is smooth and easy, and I really enjoy using my phone as a remote control. Even better, you can still use your phone while streaming through it, because the actual streaming is occurring over your wifi connection. Thus, using your smartphone to control and stream content has no impact on your phone's data or battery. Just make sure you have wifi on.4. This is also great at streaming YouTube - not surprising seeing as how Google owns YouTube. Pandora is also flawless.5. One thing that this is missing is the ability to stream Amazon Prime content. I understand why since Google and Amazon appear to be competing, especially with the launch of Fire TV, but it's a miss for me. I have to rely on my Roku for that.6. The Chromecast is exclusively for streaming third part content. As of now, you can't send your own video from your phone to the tv using Chromecast.Overall, this is an excellent choice if you are just looking for a simple and easy way to stream Netflix, YouTube, and Pandora from your smartphone to your tv, or from your computer and don't want to mess with an HDMI cable. There is potential that Chromcast could expand their capabilities and allow for more variety in streaming as well. You really can't find a better streaming device at this price point, so I would recommend this strongly as an entry level device or for a bedroom or guest room tv. I use this in the bedroom and leave my Roku and Blu Ray player in the living room.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "M. Clem"}]
