[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I am giving this item 3 stars because I am unable to watch HBO Now with this product.  HBO GO is available but the two services are different and since my reason for buying the Amazon fire stick was to avoid having cable or satellite service and still be able to watch my favorite HBO shows this device does not meet my satisfaction. Other than that the device works fine and was easy to set up. I have even unplugged it from one television to another without having to reastablish my connection to wifi.  I'm not very tech savvy and the setup with this was very easy basically plug it in and you are ready.  My husband has an iPad and I find we still use that to watch shows and news more than using the fire stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Dawn hicking"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It is difficult to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Debra Schmidt"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ron L Blanch"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Many programs without having to pay.

I disconnected my satellite service and only use the Fire Stick and have not been happier in terms of TV entertainment. In addition, the HD quality is outstanding!! I have never seen it so clear and I was very happy with the quality the satellite service provided! Obviously, I highly recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "it wasn't easy to figure out.

It worked great in the beginning. If you lightly touched the remote the firestick would  automatiucaly come on but after a month the firestick stopped working. I could not turn it on with the remote even if I  unplugged it and plugged it back in it would not work so Amazon replaced it with a refurbished one same thing happened with the refurbished one. I am highly disappointed by this Amazon product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Tameka Johnson"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Can't even use it.
