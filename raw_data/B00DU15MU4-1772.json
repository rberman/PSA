You need to go Prime. It's worth it. Voice command remote is outstanding. As long as your mouth is not full of food or gargling mouthwash, your voice command selection will be spot on every time. Quad core processors make the difference. This tiny black box screams between menu selections and produces  super quality resolution. Buy the $6 Amazon HDMI cable. It really makes the difference. Amazon Fire TV is way ahead of the competition.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D. Murphy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love our Amazon Fire TV! I have three boys that are 13, 11 & 8. They said, \"Let's get rid of our cable!\" Say no more, cable is gone. They are huge sports fans & don't want to miss a game & keep up with their fantasy football. Amazon Fire meets all their needs & mine. Get it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "N.
