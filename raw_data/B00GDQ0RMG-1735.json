Ryals"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "We liked Amazon's Fire TV Stick enough to buy a second one a month later.The Fire Stick has much better clarity than our Roku HD does. Since I fall asleep to Netflix, I like that the Fire Stick Netflix app keeps playing one after another. That's another thing that the Roku Netflix app didn't do.There are a couple of glitches. The Fire Stick doesn't do a very good job of stopping apps running in the background. For example, if we switch from listening to Pandora to watching a movie, we end up with terrible lag. Sometimes, the music keeps playing while the movie is running. Likewise, the sound will sometimes run while the picture is still loading.We've found that forcing a restart fixes this every time. (Have you tried turning it off and on again?) :-) We end up having to restart about once a day. More on one of our Fire Sticks than the other. Strange, but not big enough of a deal to make us want to find something else.We're pleased.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mandy"}]
