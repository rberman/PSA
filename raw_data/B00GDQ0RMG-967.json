I got the Fire TV Stick for Amazon Prime Instant Videos and NetFlix. I have an Android \"Mini Console\" for playing Android games on my TV but the Amazon Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix apps are hard to control. So I thought this would be a good option for that. Sadly, I was wrong. The Fire TV Stick has limited cache and even more limited wi-fi reception. For these reasons it is constantly buffering during streaming. It is impossible to even get through a 40 minute episode with out it buffering at least 3 times. We also loose access to Netflix all together whenever someone uses the microwave.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Sir Jaxxy \"Jeff\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's ok.
