[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I've owned a number of streaming devices and the Fire TV Stick has been the best one by far.  The user interface is intuitive and easy to use.  It is fast and responsive, unlike the frustratingly slow response from many other devices.The only flaws so far have been occasional crashes of a couple of the apps and the awkward search feature is cumbersome with the basic remote.  Well worth the money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "ReviewsByDeal"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I can't really give this an honest evaluation because I still can't get it to connect to the wifi.  Every other product in my house (Roku, Xbox One, Sony Smart TV, Dell laptop) can all connect to my wifi but the Amazon Fire Stick can not.

I had a few hiccups with getting my new flat screen tv to recognize it but after the initial update on a separate tv it worked great on all my tvs. The speed of this thing is sick, video plays great and sounds great over my surround sound. For the money this is one of those no brainers. Especially at the $19 pre order price and its even worth the full $40 price. I wish it had DLNA and gonna throw a big complaint out there. Amazon please allow the usb port on the back of the Fire TV box to play video from a flash drive or external hard drive. I make some short films and plugging it in the back to see how it looks on tv would ease my life a little. Sorry I know that has nothing to do with the stick I just had to get that out of my system. Anyways this is great! If I have any issues I'll update. Enjoy! Oh And sorry for the grainy vid. I did this for You**be and i had to downgrade the quality to meet Amazon's criteria for videos.

I bought thinking you could add streaming services ala roku. No dice. Not flexible enough. Would also like to access outlook cloud. I won't return only because the price was right. Also the damn battery cover is insanely difficult to open! This is something that really has to be addressed. 65 years old and decades of electronic experience and never seen anything as badly designed as the battery cover access on the remote for this device!!!!!!!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/5", "author": "daHawk"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received this product about five days ago.
