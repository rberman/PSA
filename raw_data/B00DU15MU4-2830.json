[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I want to give this 5-stars, because it really is an amazing device that functions incredibly well. But it has two huge faults in my eyes.The Good:-The UI is very friendly. It's smooth, intuitive, and beautiful.-Response times are impressive. Videos play SIGNIFICANTLY faster than any other streaming device I've used.-The gaming functionality is more advanced than I predicted. Though the controller could use improvements (but that doesn't factor into my review), games are affordable and I'd say the graphics are similar to that of the PS2/XBOX generation.-It offers most of the popular streaming services, aside from HBO Go (but that will be coming later this year).The Bad:-No Google Play media access. I often purchase my media through Google because they're cheaper. I understand Amazon is a competitor, so it might make sense to leave Google Play support out, but they are competing in a set-top box market. A product competing in the set-top box market is only a 5-star product if it supports ALL the dominant streaming avenues.EDIT: People seem to be misunderstanding this, so to clarify: I want to be able to access my MEDIA purchased from the Play store - not my Play apps.Edit 2: Thought of another thing that needs improvement-Prime content is not easily or clearly separated from purchasable content. There are a couple Prime filters which display nothing but free content, but it's otherwise difficult to browse or search free content. It seems like Amazon is really trying to push users to buy content instead of provide a Netflix-like experience. Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that Amazon allows purchasing content that isn't available for free, but I would like an easier way to browse the movies/shows that are free for Prime users.The Ugly:-Only 5 gb of storage -non-expandable- (advertised as 8, but of course the Android install requires some of that space). This is advertised as a GAMING-capable device, which even has a gaming controller available. Yet, some of the games consume 1gb+ storage. At that rate, you can only store a few games on the device before it is full.If Amazon were to allow Google Play apps and USB storage for additional game/app installations, this would easily be a 5-star product. Unfortunately, I doubt either of those issues will be addressed. And because of it, I see an Android TV in my future.Edit 3: Bumping up to 4-stars for a few reasons. The addition of HBO content is great! It's become easier to distinguish between Free (for Prime members) and Paid content. And lastly, the external storage issue and lack of Google Play store can both be worked around by rooting the device. Rooting is not for everyone, but I'm comfortable with it so it's enough for me to give it a little boost in my rating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "chdel85"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The search works great with Amazon, but not Netflix or the other apps.

I could get neither sound nor picture. The input worked perfectly with my Apple TV and Roku so I know the input worked correctly. Based on this I returned the unit to Amazon who promptly refunded my money. Amazon are always good about this sort of thing.Since the device provided no new features that I do not already have, I did not request another unit. I had purchased this unit purely to investigate the new Amazon Fire TV. I believe that Amazon have some early teething troubles that need to be sorted out. I have purchased a number of Kindles from Amazon and they have worked flawlessly so I think this may be a one off. I may try it again later but for the moment I enjoy Amazon videos via my Roku which works perfectly, for the moment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "P.

The only thing that bothers me  is the the remote doesn't appear to have an audio jack for private listening.  I watch TV after everyone is asleep and I really like to turn up the volume for action movies.  I could plug in headphones into the audio receiver but it requires that I use a long extension or move right next to the TV.
