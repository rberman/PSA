[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I'd been accessing Amazon instant video through my PS3, and lately using the PS3 only for that, which was fine, but always a chore to switch over from cable and get into the videos.  I got the Fire stick free with Ooma phone service, and honestly didn't expect much difference in using it compared to the PS3, but, yeah, there were a lot of differences.  First, set-up was a breeze.  The stick comes with an extender that made it easy to reach those cramped HDMI ports on my TV.  The stick arrived already activated, and after a short video introduction, I was ready to go.  The remote control is one of my favorite things.  There are just a few buttons, laid out intuitively, and after just a couple of uses, it's easy to remember the button placement without looking at the remote each time.  If I'm watching cable, and want to switch over to the Fire stick, I just push any button on the remote, and Fire stick activates & automatically switches the TV input for me.  Rather than all the steps it took to switch to my PS3, just pressing one button takes me right to Amazon.  The ease of use, along with the top-quality sound & video make this a great device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Michael Vaughan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the ease of setup.

Limited written instructions and what was on the screen was in German. We had no idea how to change the language. Then there was a problem  with our password. We googled help  found it no help at all because many people had our same issues. We finally called Amazon and did get someone to walk us through the whole process, but it took about 45 minuy. No way we could have done it alone.

It worked well for a few months but then we kept getting error messages and were being kicked back to the home screen.  About one month later, it completely stopped working.  I was very disappointed that Amazon would make and sell such low quality.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Andrea"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great solution for households like my wife's relatives that want easy access to Netflix, HBO GO, etc. without the hassle and expense of an HTPC.Works right out of the box with little to no setup issues and is loads faster than the Roku Stick.

We got it just in time to watch the ufc fight 190, BUT couldn't watch it because it kept FREEZING & jumping and canceling out on its own. I'm not sure if it's because a lot of people were probably watching or what! My internet connection was very good so idk what it was!! Most of the movies on here hardly works! You can't watch a full movie without it PAUSING! But right now my son is watching the Lorax, & SO FAR it's doing fine! Let's hope it stays this way!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Kiilani Keomaka"}]
