[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Unlike my kindle fire tablet, the Fire TV Stick is an complete disappointment. The issue is that even though i can use my smartphone, kindle fire tablet, laptop, & iPad anywhere in my house (connect to network and have a dropped-network free experience) the Fire TV Stick just doesn't stay connected to my network. It works for a few minutes (or seconds) then drops me--repeatedly. I checked my cable connections and verified that the Fire Stick was plugged into the appropriate USB port. After my experience tonight with my Fire Stick not even finding my network, i am sending it back. I live in the city and have good Wi-Fi and shouldn't have to put up with this garbage from an Amazon product. I'll never bother with the Fire Stick again. I should have known that if the batteries were so hard to put into the remote control, this product was not going to work for me!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Island of 3"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Erin C"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great value for the money.
