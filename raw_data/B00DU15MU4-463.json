[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Overall a great experience. However it is lacking I. That you have to pay for many of the shows you want to watch. Hopefully this will soon change and this will replace cable permanently.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "chase hayden"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Not having to run cable into another room in my home and pay for more cumbersome cable boxes was fantastic.  This tiny little box with its voice activated remote is more than worth the money.

Although I knew the device wasn't sold here, I was not aware that movies and television shows on Amazon Prime are not licensed in Canada, so none of them are available to me here.  The music selection is very limited as well.  I will only be able to use the Fire TV for the few months of the year that I live in Florida.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Earthy"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Still on the fence on this product. Looking to save money on our TV bill & a little disappointed to find not as much available for free using Amazon Prime as we had hoped. Plenty of programs, just not a lot of current content or movies.
