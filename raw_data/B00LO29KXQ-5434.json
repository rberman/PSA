Now I can use my Prime on my main TV.  In the past I was accessing Prime through my Samsung Blu-Ray player in my bedroom which was not as useful as accessing it in my Great Room on our largest TV.

Bravo Amazon!  Works with my Slingbox.  Clearly worth twice the price.  Buy it!  It's easier to use than Apple TV!  just as good, if not better than Chromecast!  I have all of them.

Very fast! The iphone app controller is cool as well. This is much faster than the Chromecast that i use on my downstairs tv. I am very surprosed about the speed of the GUI and ease of use.
