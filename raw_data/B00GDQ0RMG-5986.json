[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I snagged this when amazon was having a $20 special. We have two of the Fire TV's which we bought for $84 each. This is basically the same thing if you don't care about storage. We just have these for Netflix, Prime, etc. Our kitchen TV doesn't have a cable drop, so this was perfect for me to watch Netflix, HBO, etc. while cooking.

Better than Chromecast, no need to have your tablet or phone. All Apps are loaded into the Fire Stick. No lag on Wi-Fi, love the many options available in terms of movie/tv apps.

I got the Fire Stick during the two-day sale because \"I gots to know.\"  Performance-wise, it actually does a better job of streaming than my Sony, especially on Amazon Video.  The only drawback for me, as with other Amazon products, is that it can't do Vudu.  But I'm actually keeping it plugged into my main TV because of the better performance of Fire on networks it can handle.  I'm impressed enough to spring for a Fire box when time to upgrade.
