The most glaring issue for this device that cannot overcome any positives about it is its terrible wifi performance.  I have this and a chromecast device in the same room and they are right next to my wireless access point.  I have used speedtest to check my wifi speed and get over 10 megs/sec.  The google chromcast can stream content without buffering.  The fire stick buffers constantly and looses connection on a regular basis.  No other wireless devices I have in my house (over 10) have any problem with speed except this device.  I did get this device for a great price, $25, but it is almost worthless to me because of its connection issues.  Too bad, I really want to like this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Robert W Grubbs"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "my 6 yr old grandson and I set it up together ...too easy to assemble and great so easy to navigate...worth the wait ...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "michelle d. adams-rivera"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Substandard offering: plex stutters, no volume control.

I have a Chromecast that i've had since it first came out that I used to watch Netflix content and I figured that the Fire TV Stick would be the best of both worlds.It's a great way to watch Amazon Prime content but there are currently some content available with the Chromecast that isn't available on the Fire Stick.  That isn't so much of a big deal right now considering it's fairly new and the apps need go be developed for it.  There are a bunch of other apps I haven't even checked out yet so that's a plus.The major drawback is that I periodically get logged out of Netflix which means I have to log back in again.  I've had it happen twice in the same week so there isn't some 90 timeout i'm hitting.Pros:* Access to Amazon content* Access to Netflix, Showtime Anytime, and other content* Dedicated remote* Phone/Tablet app to use as a remoteCons:* Periodic logout from Netflix* No HBO GO or Max Go yet (I thought I read HBO Go was on the way)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Danny"}]
