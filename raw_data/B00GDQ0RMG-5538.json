[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Really slick device.  I've had issues with my Google Chromecast and buffering.  I haven't had any problems with the Fire Stick.  I've been playing movies through Amazon Prime and Netflix and made it through all movies without a single buffering issue.  I am also using the stick about 30 feet away from my WIFI.  The only issue is lack of additional apps, but I think time will bring in more app support.  It doesn't support casting from a device like the Chromecast, but I think the rock steady playback is an excellent trade off.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "walter ostlie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was a little unsure when I placed my advance order for the new Fire Stick. But when I got it, I filled the easy to use set up directions, selected a program and watched away. Must easier to use than our new \"smart\" TV ( which I paid a merchant to program) if I had Fire Stick 1st, I could have saved the TV $$$. Now my seconday set has first class service!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SMS1253"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!Works great.Buying more for other TV's", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jed tarasi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Like it works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tobias Russo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Overall, very similar to my Roku devices I have elsewhere in my home, but at a much better price. The box is extremely well packaged and it was amazingly simple to get everything running. I liked the idea of the external power for the stick since USB devices do not always get enough power from the USB receptacle itself. I got mine for the initial $19.95 offering and it was a good snap purchase.My only tiny gripe is that to get the batteries in the remote, I had a devil of a time getting the battery compartment open. There is no real slot or grip to allow easy access to put the batteries in. I resorted to a knife to gently pry open the compartment and then it was easy enough. On the plus side, Amazon even provided the batteries for the remote, so it all worked out in the end. I'd recommend to Amazon to at least get a slot cut in the battery door so people have a shot at getting the batteries in and out without issue.Overall operation, intuitive and simple. The search function is extremely basic but effective. I did like the fact my Amazon stored music will play through the TV via the stick - very nice feature. I also like the fact that a nice screensaver comes up when the device is inactive - very slick.Video streaming is extremely smooth, no complaints at all. It is everything Amazon says it will be and I've had great luck with all of the Amazon brand devices - they stand for quality. The feel of the remote, the stick itself and even the little charger are all that of quality and I'm sure this thing will run for years and years with no troubles.Final judgement; An extremely well packaged and quality device. Recommend purchasing - you won't be sorry.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jon Almada"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "When it's on sale, there's very little reason why you shouldn't buy this Fire TV Stick. Not only does it provide flawless access to Amazon's Video content, it's Netflix app is excellent (both in picture and audio quality). Add HBO To Go to the mix and it's nothing short of a no brainer. I also own and enjoy my Chromcast, but the lack of a remote and the dependency on streaming/controlling from another device gets old. Amazon's Fire TV stick's simple remote and ability to load apps (like Netflix) really sets it apart. Now if they'd only support streaming from a laptop, it would be the ONLY one you'd need.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Geoffrey Kleinman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got my Fire Stick yesterday. So far I love it! It was easy to set up, streams beautifully in HD, and the videos have all been pretty quick to load. The only problem that I've encountered so far is that the Hulu app crashed once, but I attribute this more to Hulu, as it has crashed for me on multiple devices and platforms. Overall I am loving my Fire stick! I cannot wait for Amazon to add HBOgo, that'll just be the icing on the cake!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Val"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Pros:You can tell its android (FireOS I'm sure), the developer options are exposed and you can load apk's on it and use adb (though I haven't tried yet but I did see the options in settings)It has a remote, I like the chromcast but having to unlock your phone to pause or play the next episode makes you appreciate the remote.Cons:There doesn't seem to be a way to restrict purchases without also requiring a PIN to adjust settings.This device won't output 1080i preventing use on my older big screen that doesn't support 1080p or 720p.
