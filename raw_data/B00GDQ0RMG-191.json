[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "This product has a hard time staying connected to my amazing and fast home network.It is very frustrating, as some days it works fine, but most days it is in and out, stopping or slowing down playback, even though it is always plugged into the power outlet.  My smart tv works better without this device.  I only got it for HBO Now.  But, not sure it was worth it really.  Just makes watching anything on it, an act of futility.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "KC"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very fast and easy I like it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gary l. gruber"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome.
