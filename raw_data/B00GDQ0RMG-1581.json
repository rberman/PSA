Besides the obvious benefits of Amazon Prime like two-day no additional cost shipping, the Prime benefits of the Fire TV stick have to be seen to be believed. Incredible video selections of movies and TV shows not available elsewhere are just the start of what you get. Amazing audio channels and arrangements that Amazon has with video and audio producers make this something so worthwhile. You just have to try it to see what it can do for you. Your use of media will be like nothing you ever expected before. I even added Hulu Plus through Amazon Fire TV as an additional benefit. It makes you wish each day was 48 hours instead of 24.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "K.
