It also allows me to push videos up on the screen through the Chrome browser which is quite nice. I often watch UK television via my browser and can now watch it on my HDTV thanks to Chromecast. For $35 it's probably the cheapest and easiest option for a lot of viewers.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John B"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the chromecast HDMI .....Not only that it's cheap compare to the competition,it's easy to use and the pictures are crystal.Every member of the family love it,and I'll certainly recommend it for friends....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "MAMADOU LAMARANA BAH"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Unable to se in  the tv any thing but e-mails.Can not see my pictures.Letters font to small to appreciate at a distance.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
