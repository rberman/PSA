The only drawback is, you cannot  steam anything to your TV from any  \u201cios\u201d product, like (iPhone) (iPad) or (iPod) otherwise I recommend it if you want a good product, for a good price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stanley H."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got this when it launched for $19 so that's a big plus for me. I'm a huge Amazon fan and I was going to buy the Fire TV but just happened to catch this first.It was super easy to install and set up. I have not run into any problems as far as loading or downloading games, apps, shows, or music. The picture quality is wonderful. My almost 4 year old has already mastered getting to the shows or games that he wants so it's obviously not difficult to use.I don't have any experience with ChromeCast, Roku, etc. so I can't compare anything to them. However, I am very happy with the Fire TV stick and don't feel the need to check out any other streaming devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use and the app makes it so much fun.

I was ready to use it after plugging it in and entering my network settings. I've used the Pandora app and watched a couple of movies on it. I like how you don't have to turn it off. My only disappointment is the availability of the remote app. It is not available for iOS.
