[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I connected my Fire Stick through an Onkyo NR838 receiver without any connectivity issues. Several reviewers had said that it would not connect through a receiver but it worked fine with my Onkyo. After watching the mandatory orientation video, it automatically registered the unit and came back with the home screen. Entered my Netflix info and began watching a movie all within about 10 minutes total start to finish. The Stick is about the same speed as my Roku 3 maybe a little faster but not a lot. Controlling the Stick through my Kindle Fire will take a little getting use to but it should not be a problem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "James Martin"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Not working", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rajesh"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got the Fire TV Stick a couple weeks ago. Initially it was a little slow loading the latest software, but that is because in the location that I have it there is not the best WiFi signal. Every since the initial software update I have not had any problems streaming content or watching TV shows or movies. Love the Fire TV stick and might be buying some as stocking stuffers this year.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "N Beck"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works Great!!

My Roku 2 feels slow and sluggish so I was looking for an upgrade.It's much faster than the Roku 2, however, I'm disappointed in the channel selection, especially news sources.  Probably will buy a Roku 3 and ditch this.Also I'm a lifetime Plex Pass owner.  I was quite annoyed to find they want another $5 for the Fire TV app which is getting lack luster reviews, so I'm not sure I'll purchase that and go back to the Roku 2 until I purchase the 3.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "L.
