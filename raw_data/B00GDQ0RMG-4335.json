[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This product is a must have for every household. I've had the Google chromecast and think this product is far superior. This has more features, and apps then the chromecast. The chromecast would totally suck up all my wifi and just lag it. This product doesn't lag the wifi and I keep it running 24/7. It's sleek, fast, and fun to play with.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "eddaddy \"eddaddy\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought 2 of these when they were first released for half price. They came preactivated on my Amazon account. I plugged them into the USB ports on my TVs for power rather than the wall so that they shut down when the TV is off. The interface is great and responsive. I intended to give them away as Christmas gifts but I liked them too much. I even have one of them plugged into my Smart TV because I like the interface much better. These were a steal for the $20 I paid for each of them. If I see another good deal on them I will probably put them on my other TVs.I am a little worried that the remotes might interfere with each other if you try to use multiple Fire Sticks in the same area. With one in the living room and one in my bedroom it hasn't been an issue. I haven't tried the Android remote app yet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrew"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A great working streaming device, beats the Roku stick on remote function, speed, format and video quality.

I searched the reviews, it seems a common issue and the solution is a reboot which solves the problem with nothing else needed. It is probably a firmware issue but amazon yet fails to fix it. Other minor issues, the stick gets really hot when it is in use, the photo app continuously eats the cache although it doesn't seem to cause any problem so far.Generally I am disappointed with the product and just returned mine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "lxkx"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I'm a Prime user, so I have access to a pretty large selection of free videos. I also like that I can link with my existing accounts like YouTube and Pandora.  I hear the big difference between the stick and the actual box is the quality/selection of games, so if games are important to you, get the box. Other than that, I love the portability of the device.  I look forward to bringing it with me when I travel! I took off one star b/c I havent been able to make the screen mirroring feature work, but to be fair, I'm not completely sure that it's not my cell phone's fault. Obviously, streaming TV hasn't quite found a way to replace live TV, but if you're looking for an inexpensive way to watch TV, I'd say this is a no brainer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CScott"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I just got my Firestick today. I installed & set it up in abt 20 min. I love it! Before I had to stream thru my iPad, with a special cord & adaptor, tonight I didn't have to do that.
