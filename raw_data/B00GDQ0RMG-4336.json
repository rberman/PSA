I don't buy or rent movies so it's ok for Netflix. It would be a lot better if the smartphone app actually worked but it doesn't. A lot of room for improvement with this one, only marginally better than my 4 year old smart bluray better. I received it as a premium for purchasing another item so for free I guess it's allright", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven B."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I absolutely love it.

The remote is intuitive (and a major advantage vs. Chromecast which has no remote).  I also was able to load additional content providers such as PBS (though these providers do not work so well, at least not all the time, with significant buffering problems).  I wish that casting from android and ios devices was a bit easier/more straightforward but this will surely come with system updates.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carlos"}]
