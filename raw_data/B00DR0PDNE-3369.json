[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works just as advertised.  Now I can control whatever Netflix or YouTube content that I wish to view, by using either my smartphone or iPad.  Will only get better as more providers sign-on!  My only concern is that someone will figure out how to charge a monthly fee to use this device. Highly recommended.UPDATE: It works so well that I purchased a second one, as a gift for one of my kids.

First, the Chromecast dongle or media player does work and it doesn't take much expertise (thank GOD on MY part for that) to get it up and running.Your TV will ideally have a spare HDMI and USB port for the device to plug into.  Checking the back of your HD TV before ordering for these open ports would be a wise thing to do as some of the early HD televisions only had 2 HDMI ports and those are quickly used up on your satellite/cable boxes to plug into and your DVR player.  Then too, one of my early HD televisions had NO USB ports so be advised on that.  If you have the spare ports, and you should, it's a simple matter of plugging in the Chromecast device, then using your TV's remote (the brand name TV remote, not your Directv remote),to advance the screen to the HDMI port you plugged the device into.  In my case it was HDMI 3.The TV screen will return data right away, recognizing the device and putting a code number out.  Follow the on screen prompts, enter your in-home wifi access number which you'll do from your mobile device.  In my case it was using my Samsung Note II phone.  By the way, you will have already quickly downloaded the Chromecast software from the internet onto your phone.  The instructions in the device box will provide the address and this exercise is straightforward and without drama.  I already had Netflix software loaded on my phone so you'll need to do that if you haven't already.The TV screen will again recognize and advise that Chromecast is ready for use.  Pick a Netflix movie from your phone, play it and once it starts, hit the small box icon on top of screen to activate the Chromecast which in turn will be now grabbed by your TV showing the familiar red Netflix screen, along with a time circle and a small bar revealing the status of the movie download (5%....9%...20% etc).  Once done, on your phone, hit the start arrow and voila, the movie will play on your TV.  You can pause and re-start the movie from your phone.  The audio volume can be done with your remote..either from the TV maker or Directv remote in my case.Getting out of the movie and back to regular TV fare is a matter of again changing the HDMI port back to main viewing status, in my case that would be HDMI 1.  Sometimes you'll have to turn off the power to the TV and cable/satellite box in order for the dongle to 'let go'.  At least that's been my early experience as it keeps toggling back to HDMI 3 when I try the easy route to get back to regular TV viewing.  In essence, the dongle converts your HD television into one with SmartTV capability.  I only wanted to view Netflix movies on my TV and can't speak of what else the Chromecast can or cannot do.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "R Rated \"Keeping it real\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is fun technologyIt's fun to be able to send movies from my tablet or phone directly to my TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Grifatkins \"Grifatkins\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Affordable price, easy set up.

After many attempts I gave up on Sony and bought this and now I can mirror Hulu from either phone or my laptop.  There are some things that won't broadcast yet and it shows it's not supported, but they said they're working on adding more soon.  You do have to use a Chrome browser to use it with the computer, which isn't an issue for me since I had it installed already, but it would be nice if that wasn't a requirement, but it's less expensive than a Roku device and it works for what I was trying to resolve, although there have been a few buffering problems on occasion, so I'm overall satisfied and I would recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jordy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Keeping it simple.
