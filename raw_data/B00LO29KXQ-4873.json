I have a suspicion that these remotes will be a problem because the disc on top reminds me of the ones on the old early 80's Intellivision video game systems, The games were great but the controllers didn't last because the disc wore out fast, and I suspect this might be a problem here too.The product is really good though. Maybe I just got a bad one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
