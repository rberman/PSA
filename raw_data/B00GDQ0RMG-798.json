I bought it to use because my Samsung smart TV's smart hub stopped working and I was unable to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime movies, which I subscribe to. Now with the Amazon Fire TV Stick I can watch Netflix and since I'm an Amazon Prime member it is so easy to access all the Amazon Prime movies and music. I'm still discovering all the apps and games that are available.  The ease of use is wonderful, just plug in and play!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "meilan"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Netflix app needs work it is annoying, loading another movie before credits finish.

Amazon was prompt and delivered a 2nd TV stick as replacement. I updated software, installed the apps. Similar ghosting issues. HBO go menu is also a bit slow to react. I then opened smithsonian, ted, huff post live, and prime TV. I notice that HD content causes the most hiccups. And if there's a lot of movement. If the camera is panning while multiple things are moving the ghosting can be pretty bad. So depending on content it can range from unwatchable to slight annoyance. Spent nearly an hour with their nice reps.
