[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I am a long time user of the NeoTV Max and have them on 4 TV's.  Being an Amazon fan, I decided to try the Fire TV Stick.  It's OK. One major feature missing...  the NeoTV has integrated WiDi.  With the Fire Stick, I have to use the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter also.  This takes up two HDMI ports where the NeoTV only required one.  Also, Amazon needs to be able to power the device from the USB port available on the TV.  One of the things I was hoping the Amazon product would do was eliminate the extra cords hanging down from the TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christina"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this thing!
