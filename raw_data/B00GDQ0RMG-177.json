Back it went and plugged in the replacement..worked perfectly, here we are 3 weeks later and now it freezes while loading some things..loads others but then turns to a gray screen. Tried all the trouble shooting, nothing worked. So back it goes..2 fire sticks and barely a month later, this time I'm getting my money back and buying the Roku. For such a large company you'd think a product would work better..very disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sara"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bombbbbbb", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "scott a mrsny"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bettye Northern"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works just a great as brand new ones", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "wayne"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Loved it!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "denise walsh"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It was rip off.
