I have 1,200 films in the account and I cannot get the app to work. It just keeps spinning, then times out for an error.I also would have liked more game controllers to be able to be used, but I suppose that is not Amazon's fault.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jonathan Hernandez \"Jon Birdman Attorney at DVD\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE IT! I toyed with getting a Chromecast, but was put off by not being able to use Amazon Prime Instant Video (properly) on the device. I was also set out to replace my PS3 which I've been using to get media to my dumb tv across the house utilizing PS3 media server software on my home server.The Fire TV Stick first off is perfect if you are a Prime member. The seamless integration with the Prime services, Instant Video, Music, etc., makes this device the perfect media player. I had some issues with the PS3 Amazon Instant app when streaming movies and what not, and the FireTV one is flawless. I haven't had a hiccup yet and with the PS3 app i was lucky to get through an episode without some type of buffering action.The Fire TV Stick is also perfect as you can load a lot of different Apps to it as well. The big one for me was picking up the Plex app for free on the Fire Stick and on all my android devices during holidays sales. The Plex media server blows away the PS3 media server, and being able to use this on the Fire Stick makes all the difference.Overall, I am loving this device. I can watch ESPN on it, MLB.tv when the season rolls back around, plus the multitude of games, shows, music, that all perform flawlessly.Once they are back in stock I will be buying more and one will be on every TV in the house.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DesertLew"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic, so well worth the $39 for it!
