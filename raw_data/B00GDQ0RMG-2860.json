In the end I went with the Fire TV stick because it didn\u2019t need a phone or table like the Chrome Cast and I was only going to use it to stream so I didn\u2019t need the extra power of the Fire TV Box. As for the Roku this does the same thing and is much cheaper. The only issue I had was steaming my own library of movies and music, the Roku can do this out of the box. However there is a really easy way to \u201cSide Load\u2019 applications onto this device and several tools and tutorials that make this very easy. And if you don\u2019t think you are technical enough to do this (Although it is very easy) you can simply buy the Plex app and set up a Plex server (although this and side loading are about the same level of difficulty) This gives the Fire TV stick a leg up on all the competition as you can fully customize it to your exact needs. I am very happy with the Fire TV stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anthony"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really great stick for streaming.
