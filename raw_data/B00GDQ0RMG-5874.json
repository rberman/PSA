[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "My husband loves the stick because it has ESPN, and he watches it everyday since we received it.The reason why I take out one star is because of the remote controller. First, the battery pocket is very difficult to open. It does not have a place for your fingers to hold and slide open the pocket cover. It took us a long time to open up the battery pocket cover. It was not a pleasant open box experience when you have your finger turn red from trying to open the cover.Second, the remote controller is difficult to use, especially when you have an impatient family member. You have to press every button carefully and wait until the screen reacts. The remote control has a flimsy plastic feeling, and there is no feedback ( light or sound) after you press buttons, but only the plastic \"click\" sound like an old style toy. The circle button is very confusing since I have no idea if I pressed the right direction and have to wait a while for the screen to react to know if I did it right. During my hubby's first use of the controller, he pressed the buttons many times without waiting for the screen to react, then the button stuck. The TV starts to make funny clicking noise and the whole screen froze. In the end, he download the Android remote controller to the phone to control the screen.Other than the controller, everything works great. Now we do not use the controller and feel happy about it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susan. W. \"sunnysmom\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Simple and easy to hook up.

Setup to my wireless network went smoothly and the firmware update completed succesfully (took a bit of time but was successful).  I watched several shows without any freezing the picture quality was very good and the sound was good.  on the thrid show I tried watching via the 'History Channel app' ended up freezing on me several times.  I'm not sure if this was an issue with the fire tv stick or my wifi/internet connection.  I marked it up to a internet/network issue.  The following day I got new internet service (switched from Century Link to Comcast) and now I cannot get my fire tv stick to connect to the internet.  I know the fire tv stick works, so it has to be an issue with my moden/router configuration with Comcast/Xfinity.  However I have not been able to find any help on either Amazon or Xfinity to fix the problem therefore I cannot use the fire tv stick I purchased so I'm giving it 3 stars.  I believe this is an issue with my Router not the fire tv stick but I cannot rule anything out yet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "rider"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It has a lot of great features, but the interface is clunky and I HATED the unskippable into video.

For me the Fire Stick is awesome because it works without internet. It can access local media without complaining about the lack of an internet connection. I put it in my van, with a monitor and a little file server/wifi hotspot box and now my kids have a cheap but effective entertainment system for those long trips.I don't care for the interface, it's clean and simple, but if you have a lot of apps/media/etc it becomes tedious very quickly. They neglected to give you a voice search button on the remote, so unless you want to pickup your phone(firetv app) as well as the remote, navigating can be a real pain.On the plus side, you can sideload apps, there are far more functional apps for the fire stick than what amazon wants to admit to.On the negative side, screen mirroring is junk, if you can get it to work at all, and if you can find it hiding deep in the settings menu. Amazon really dropped the ball here since it's obvious competition is the chromecast.All in all, I'd say it's the best tv stick out there considering what you get vs what you paid, but it's still not that one perfect media solution.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Screwyluie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick installed easily and is remarkably fast.  The Stick was purchased for a TV other than the one we mainly watch which has the Fire TV installed with it.  So, the with the Stick we have given up the ability to speak commands to the tv in lieu of having to use the controller to index to the item we want.  However, I am going to download the app to my phone that allows me to use that as a controller which should be superior to the remote that comes with the Stick...although it works great and is very responsive when working with the Stick.  Overall  the Stick is so much more powerful than the Roku that I replaced.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charlie G"}]
