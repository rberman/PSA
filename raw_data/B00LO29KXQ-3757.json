After contacting Amazon support another unit was sent to replace original. Again, after about a month it completely died. In both instances part of my own diagnostics was to reinstall older Roku unit that Fire TV Stick was meant to replace. Roku worked without a hitch.Fire TV Stick was OK as long as it was working (some limitations on channel selection options vs Roku) but seeming to have to replace every month or so while the Roku has be flawless for more that 2 years, got old real fast.
