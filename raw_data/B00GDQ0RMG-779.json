With the Fire stick, t's somewhat smarter.  Now I can watch Netflix and Amazon prime upstairs.I was hoping that HBO go would work, but Charter apparently doesn't have an agreement that allows use on this device.  Too bad.  I hear there's a workaround with a sideload, a bluetooth keyboard/mouse, and an Android, but that's a lot of effort when I can just hook up my laptop to an HDMI.
