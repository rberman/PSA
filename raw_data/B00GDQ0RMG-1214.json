My Appke AirPort Extreme wireless router is 3 feet from the Fire Stick and it still can't run Netflix smoothly, it stutters and skips.  Videos on Plex have to pause and load, if you want them to run smoothly you have to reduce the quality so much there's no way you'd enjoy watching it.  It would probably work fine if I could plug an Ethernet cable into it but that defeats the point doesn't it?  The Fire TV would most likely work fine, it's got plenty of power and an Ethernet port but I'm not going to spend $30 more then an Apple TV for one.  I'll iust continue to use my Playstation for Amazon Videos.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "B.

Now, I can appreciate my Roku stick after purchasing the Fire TV Stick. The number of apps is very limited and the random skipping is quite annoying. More annoying than skipping and shuddering would be the random failures/shut downs. There seems to be many kinks that need to be worked out. If I used mainly Amazon Prime for TV, it would be wonderful, but Hulu and Netflix are my first loves, for now. I wish the home screen was not Prime centered and offered better access to other apps and programs.I use this for the secondary television and/or family game time rather than on the main television. I will say that this stick is great for games since the PS4 is on the fritz. The kids love the gaming apps and now I must get the controller. It still better than having a high cable/satellite bill. I haven't had cable in 3-4 years.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "It's you not me \"Cindy\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Did nothing more than my Apple TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "norval johnson"}]
