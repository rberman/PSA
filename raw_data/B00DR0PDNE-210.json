[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have 75' Samsung curved UHD TV and wasn't sure why I would need this ever. I got it when it went on sale to play with it and had to buy 2 more. I don't use it on my Samsung smart tv because there is no need, I can screen mirror from my Samsung 6s. But for my garage and both of my kids this is awesome. I was even able to send back the Direct TV boxes from there rooms! If wasn't for Direct TV's exclusive on the NFL, I would drop them all together. If you can find it for $20 bucks like I did why not try it out?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Moose9779"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Literally, one of the best and most useful purchases i have ever made", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D Scott"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "excellent wing perfection works", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "marioromer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "too less apps and application on Apple device, and I cannot broadcast my Apple device screen on the TV which Android can do it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Pochun LIN"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "netfliiiix", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Theodore Turner"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "100 positive", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Juan M."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "For i am behind the GFW network,my  experience is not very good.i know it's not google's product issue,i am willing to believe google's product's very good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nemo"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Chromecast very buggy", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Ross608"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great no complaints", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dennis  E.
