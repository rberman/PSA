I also own an Apple TV which is what I was using to stream my media to the TV/Entertainment system, now the Apple TV is up in the 2nd bedroom and the Chromecast is my goto device for streaming.  Mind you this may not apply if you own a iPhone or other Apple device, but if you're running an Android device and want to get great content sent to your wifi network then this thing is what you need.For a paltry 30 bucks I can send video, music, pics, browser mirroring, etc . . . to my entertainment system.  All it takes is one starting the video/song on your device, then push one button and bam....you're watching it on your big screen.  The Apple TV does the same thing basically, but it will run you 100 bucks instead of $30.  To be fair the Apple does offer a hard wired lan connection that the Chromecast does not (wifi only) but it is not a problem, if your wifi is worth it's salt streaming will be seamless without hiccups.  If you are having problems using wifi then go get a better router!  :)I heartily recommend the Chromecast, it's the bees knees.  Get a 2nd one right from the start, or one for every TV in your house!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris Rud"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product.
