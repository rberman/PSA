[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "A few issues.  Firstly, this item is not wireless as I originally believed.  I made the incorrect assumption that the USB cord was for charging only, when it in fact must always be plugged in.  The interface itself is fine and is does all the things a normal smart TV does but in a delayed manner.  When scrolling through titles it often freezes for a moment and then scrolls feverishly though titles and a blinding speed  This becomes tiresome.  Lastly and in conclusion, I just don't think its worth the money (even at this reduced price compared to the set-top amazon fire box).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "shaun sandera"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "With the Fire Stick plugged in my DirecTV will not run.

As a prime member I was fortunate to be able to order this during the $19 promotion and am very happy with the purchase. This streams effortlessly and we never have issues with this skipping or buffering. Amazing picture quality as well, definitely one of my favorite Amazon branded items.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ashley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this a little skeptically because i bought a chromecast and returned because the streaming and casting via Wifi was horrible (pixelated, stopping). I figured with prime video available i'd give it a shot- and didn't want to spend extra on the full Fire TV. This streams as well as my hardwired Apple TV and older Roku (which i both really like fyi). No complaints whatsoever on Fire Stick. Once HBO Go arrives it's a no brainer!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "W.
