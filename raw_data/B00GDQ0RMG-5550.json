[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Device loses network connectivity when it sleeps or idles. Network connectivity is restored when you unplug device from the TV and power-source (to restart the device) or upon factory reset. The device also froze once in the menu however all video streaming was just as good as my PS4 hooked up via Ethernet. I called amazon and after about 20-30 minutes they informed me it was a known issue and have shipped out a replacement  Fire TV stick. The device menu's looked good but felt very 'beta edition' to me. It seems like they could use a lot of work to get them up to the Kindle Fire standard. I would wait to buy this device until it has been on the market a bit longer and glitches are fixed but overall i am optimistic about the device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Emily"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It does not work with my tv (Samsung LN46B530P7F) at all.  You plug it into any of the HDMI ports and the tv will recognize that it's there, but will not allow you to select it as the input.  It skips over it as if it weren't there.  I have never been so disappointed.  Switching back to my chromecast, because it has fewer shortcomings than this complete failure.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/4", "author": "Kelly R.

I have the ssip the same on each,  but on different channels so my connection will transition seamlessly as I walk through the house. The fire stick does not work under these conditions.  I noticed when the FS scanned it didn't display all 4 of the connections, but displayed them as 2 connections even though they are addressed to different channels.  I changed the ssid on my \"g\"  broadcast in the room where my fire stick is and it has seemed to fix my connection problems.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin Brendler"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "just got it - so far so awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Happy Camper \"I am a Happy Camper so I guess I\u2019m doing something right.
