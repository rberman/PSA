I have decent WiFi and this streams NetFlix really well. No issues with buffering. I have used it for music and also Google Play Movies, but not as extensively. It streams full length films and TV episodes well so that's all that I'm looking for.The only issue I have is using it on the road where a hotel has browser based wfi authentication. I don't know how to handle that scenario with this deviceBut, obverall it allows me to free up my tablet from an HDMI cord. For the value I receive, I have no need to move up to a more expensive product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kyle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Comparable to the Roku 3 in features and speed.  It doesn't have the games like Roku 3 has, but they're not very entertaining anyway and are kind of unnecessary on a TV-watching device.  I do wish they had room to put in an Ethernet port on this thing just to avoid having the Wi-Fi get drowned out by countless neighbors' own networks, but you can't have everything.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeff D"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Not good, it would never stay connected to the Internet.
