It provides easy access to a wide array of content. The two enhancements I hope to see some day are the ability to content surf, which may be hard to do, and the ability to search across content (software) providers.. Also unlike subscriptions like Showtime, which has far too much men-who-hate-women (MWHW) content, you can avoid MWHW content far more easily. I like some of the original content. I look forward to more female-friendly content, but unfortunately Hollywood is about 40-50 years behind the rest of America when it comes to sexism, and the MWHW content proves that Hollywood views sexism as a right of free speech in spite of the laws against it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We luv it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adam Herrera"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Quick easy set up - took 15 min!Got sling so it's perfectPrime rocks!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TORRIE RAMSBOTTOM"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tyrone"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Geo Wrath"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am amazed at what viewing power comes from the Amazon Fire TV stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "tex norman \"texarooty\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great buy!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cynthia Jones"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Incredibly convenient and I love that Prime instantly streams movies and TV shows.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aspiller"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Happy to be able to have a smart tv in our spare room without the cost of buying a new tv!
