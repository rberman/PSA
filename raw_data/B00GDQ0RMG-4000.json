I did too and I am a senior citizen.  However, I remained undaunted and figured that since my Panasonic Viera was purchased in 2009, prior to when streaming devices like the Fire Stick were invented, I had to somehow figure out how to make the TV recognize the device.  I got out my manual for the TV and realized that what I needed to do was to be able to label the HDMI-2 outlet where the Fire Stick was plugged in as a device--it couldn't be a streaming device because that wasn't listed as one of the options.  So I went to set-up and just selected HDMI-2 and picked one of the options (I think I selected gaming device) just to let the TV know that there was something in that HDMI-2 slot.  It worked!  The next time I turned on the TV, I went to input, selected HDMI2 and the Fire Stick HOME came up and the rest was easy.  I suspect that with a new, smart TV, none of that would have been necessary.  I watched House of Cards and knew that I had made a good choice!  If I never use the Fire Stick for anything else, just being able to see this Netflix series on a 55\" screen made the purchase worthwhile!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alice S.
