First I was happy that even without cable I could access my local channels, including an astounding number of channels from Mexico. However I missed my cable channel array. . .until I discovered the Fire TV stick!!! Just the one-time one purchase price of around $39.00. Oh, my goodness!!! I can now do my own programming choices, rent movies, access netflick, sling and even listen to non-stop news from CBS!!! I have not scratched the surface in exploring what it has to offer. Easy to set up, I am a grandmother without an IT background and it was a snap. One hiccup, but just unplugged for 3 minutes and plugged back in. I am no longer paying the cable company over one thousand dollars a year and I can choose what to watch.

The chrome stick seemed less reliable and I believe hackers used it to get into my home network. The Kindle fire stick did fail a couple of times, but I restarted pretty easily and has been working well overall.Granted, I tried the chrome stick for about a year before using the Fire TV stick, so the technology may have improved.The remote is very helpful, but would be GREAT to have a volume control.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GJ Seattle \"Seattle Shopper\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good quality and fast downloads... easy-to-use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "victor"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best entertainment ever!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Laila63"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

Id does everything is says it does and with the new update from Amazon, it's even better. Could not be happier. In fact I would buy this BEFORE Apple TV or Google. So excuse me while I go and watch more of my Amazon Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R. Solis"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I loved this when I first got it. As a Chromecast user previously, I wanted 1. A way to watch my Prime videos, and 2. A remote that was fast and efficient (using my iPhone or iPad was far from efficient). That being said, the fire stick works well for AMAZON PRIME, but not as well on Hulu Plus or Netflix. When I watch programming on Hulu or Netflix, EVERY SINGLE TIME, video feed freezes, while audio continues. I have tried every fix suggested in the help section, and it STILL HAPPENS. Bottom line: if all you want is a way to watch Amazon Prime, buy this. As for me, I'm a disappointed customer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
