SO GLAD I DID.  We have been Roku Streamers for years - cut our cable long ago.  The Amazon Fire Stick has a much better platform than the Amazon Roku app and makes watching Amazon Prime shows much easier.  My only complaint is that the remote is TINY and is easily lost by any children in my room, so I have to hide it from the kids.  Way to go Amazon, I'm impressed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mrs.V"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was so easy to use and love that my TV is now able to watch my Amazon Prime!
