[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing device for the price, especially once you install Kodi/xmbc. The remote is rather difficult to use and takes some time to get used to. I have one in every room in the house rather than a cable box. Do yourself a favor and pick one up, then install Kodi. Kodi can not be installed on any of the other devices from Amazon's competitors.The only real downside is it's need of 1A, 5V, which forces you to run a cable to wall outlet rather than be able to run with the power off the hdmi. But that doesn't take away any stars in my opinion.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Oryana Villegas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Meets all expectations", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kenneth Boudreau"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "works great,wireless speed is great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gary"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Set up was so easy anyone could do it.

It shows me what is available without hesitation or confusion.  It is impossible for me to listen to music.  The pieces start and then are interrupted while the feature re-loads.

Picked this up while it was on sale during Prime Day, was looking to have something easier to travel with than my aging Roku 3, I also have an Apple TV that stays at home.  When looking at the technical specs, this should run circles around both the Apple TV and Roku 3, but it simply does not.  All too often the interface would lag and freeze, sometimes even requiring me to pull the plug on the device.  It works great for streaming Amazon content naturally, but when you get into the other popular choices like Netflix, Hulu, and WWE Network the streaming quality just does not seem to be there and many of the apps are clunky and slow (though that is not down to Amazon.)All in all my Roku 3, despite being much older and underpowered compared to the Fire TV Stick, is a much better and smoother device.  The interface of the Fire stick is also bloated and difficult to navigate, Amazon content is easy to get to, anything else and you'll be going on a scavenger hunt.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MarkS"}]
