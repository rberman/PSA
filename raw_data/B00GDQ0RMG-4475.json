This was the easiest electronic device/system I have ever used... it took me longer to open the box than to set it up... in less than 5 minutes I was up, running, already seen the cute automatic start video on how this thing works and was already adding to my watch list!  I am serious... it was under 10 minutes and I had 20 things to watch...  I started with the Alpha House, TV Prime.. and saw almost all of season one... I love that show... it is DC based and I swear I know some of those people and I think I have to work with about half those characters!  I have not laughed so much in years!  (I am still trying to figure out how the device knew who I was and my email address.. just from the entering the router code??? Kind of scary... :) ((The hardest thing I did was to remember that letters are capitalized for the router!))Thank you AMAZON for the easiest, nicest, most affordable little streaming device... if I can install this at the end of a long day at work with not a single problem.. anyone can do this!!  (and, the device is quite durable as I dropped it trying to clean the dust out of the hdmi socket on my older tv... I need  to dust more... )  ((And, I appreciate the personal email sent last week right before shipping the Fire TV Stick to remind me that I have not been using all my Amazon Prime Perks... and to remind me of all the things I was missing!  I sure was!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Flowerdragon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "this is far better then firebox that i see from my friend.. highly recommended", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ray Chan"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It needs to have more apps available.
