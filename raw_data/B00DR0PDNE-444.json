[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "People selling this device fail to mention you have to have a compatible router.  I got what I thought was a great deal ($20) only to find it will not work with my Centurylink Actiontec M1000 modem and W1000 wireless device.  You will have to purchase another router ($25 - $250) to make it communicate with your TV.  I'm not spending a dime more.  I will post this mine on Craigslist and get rid of it.  Word of warning.  Go to Chromecast setup guide (on internet) and look at the compatibility chart before investing in this.  PS if you have a ROKU, all you need is the ROKU app for your phone or pad and it will do the same thing...without a fancy schmancy router.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Samplerman \"samplerman\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I need an app for Windows Phone.

First of all, it's $35.00.Secondly, being able to easily watch Netflix, HBO GO, youtube videos, etc. on the big screen is amazing. In the old days we have to mess around with four different cables and adapters; one for each device.Google did something right with this.
