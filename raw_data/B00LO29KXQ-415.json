[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's convenient to have access to all of these apps on my non-SMART TV.  However, I am a little disappointed in this device based on the problems that I've experienced with it, especially since it came from a company that I love.The Fire TV stick seems to \"hang\" sometimes, where it thinks it's connected to the internet but won't load anything, or it flat out won't connect to the internet even though the rest of my devices are connected.  Oftentimes using the software restart function doesn't alleviate the problem, and I'm forced to disconnect and unplug the fire stick from the TV and AC power manually in order to get it working again.  I've had to do this about a dozen times in the month that I've owned the device.Also, I'm using the PIN parental feature to prevent my children from purchasing anything on Amazon TV; however, the feature won't let them select shows and movies that are free with my Prime membership, either.  This requires me to go up and enter my PIN number every time they want to watch a free show on Amazon Prime, and it's highly annoying!I'm coping with these problems, but I definitely wonder if competitor devices would work better and have fewer problems....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeremy Briant"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "IMPRESSED!!!!!

However, the search feature is not great within the different 'apps'. In order to search you have to scroll through a linear line of letters and if you want to delete you need to scroll all the way to the right of the letter list. While the search function is dynamic and will pull up titles as you enter in letters so you don't have to type an entire title, I wish that this list was more like Apple TV's search input.  Some of the apps you also have to activate online (using a computer, phone or tablet).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kailey R."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love it !!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Noelia Araujo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is the best device for your TV.
