[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "It's only $35.00 so if you want something to be able to stream You Tube & Netflix to your TV then this is fine--however if you want to stream anything else or see web sites on your TV then you will be sorely disjointed. It's lile tryign to look a web video on an old dial up. If you have an iPhone your will be much better served by spending an extra $60 for Apple TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "JOHN W PAPPAS"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works okay.  Found that the speed of the controlling computer is very important.  I had it initially set up though an old netbook but the picture was jumpy.  Initially thought it was my network connection but when I switched over to a tablet.  Everything was fine.I hope Google starts adding apps.

Did not know that you will constantly need either a power adapter or USB connection hooked up to the device to keep it powered up, this is not too much of a hassle as the device comes with a USB cable and wall adapter; (the commercials and demos were a little misleading with the device being shown without any cables going to it)I have a Galaxy S4 and I'm having a few issues trying to get the \"Cast\" Icon to appear on the Google Chrome browser, so that I can stream the internet, but I'm sure this is my issue and I will figure it out eventually.My wife and I enjoy being able to watch Netflix in the bedroom without having to connect the Laptop via an HDMI cable and the kids love watching YouTube from their smartphone on the flat-screen.Can't complain about the price, when considering this usefulness of this device.The first device was a trial run, now I plan on purchasing 4 more to get the kids out of my bedroom and into their beds at night.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rasheed Smith"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Chromecast was easy to install and is easy to use.
