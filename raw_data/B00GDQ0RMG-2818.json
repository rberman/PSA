It doesn't always mirror the screen from my Kindle Fire HDX which was the main reason I bought this, sometimes i have to reboot one or the other first. Seems a little better with the subsequent OS updates.  Tried to share the screen from a Win 8 tablet (Asus T300) where it could see the Stick, but couldn't finish negotiating the linkage (usually disconnecting very quickly upon exchange of PIN number). When are we going to get full Miracast support with Windows? Also would have expected many more apps - more on par with what the Fire HDX supports!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Innovato"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is being used in conjunction with my satellite service. I find myself watching more of it than my subscription service (for variety's-sake). The stick offers more than the service does. I have the choice of accessing Netflix, Crackle, or Amazon Videos I had purchased. The Prime videos are listed and I can either select them to purchase/join Prime. There are game apps available to use with the \"adequate\" remote or a game controller that can be bought. There is also an option to buy a voice-controlled remote (why?-just get up already and change the channel) that can be used for a few options...not enough to buy it, in my opinion. I REALLY enjoy my Fire Stick. The reason I rated four instead of five stars is that the stick dropped a few times more than expected (even after I had my lines and TV checked)...I think the problem is in the stick. Other than that, my family loves the options, I watch it more than my service, and honestly...when watching it, I don't miss my service. This is leading me to reconsider the service. It it really worth it? Keep the internet for WIFI and drop the other stuff. Time will tell. One more increase in service fees and I will know what to do!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dwranny \"Dwranny\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It works like it was advertized but there's no way to shut it off", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pedro Ramirez"}]
