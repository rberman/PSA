Just ordered a game controller to try that out as well! We are not very technical,  if we can do it anyone can!

If you're used to streaming devices it's slightly easier.  My sister still needs a lesson from me on occasion but one you've got it, you've got it.  I have some wishes regarding some of the apps, I wish it had the Fox News app that I can get on my roku, but otherwise I love it.  The remote is much easier than streaming with your latptop or  phone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jennifer Church"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Horrible product with glitches.  Moreover, no adequate technical support services.  It doesn't work on all TVs as. It reads some TVs as a recording device, which Mazon doesn't want to using!  Had calls with Technical support and they didn't even understand the problem as well as reviewers who posted their similar experiences. Do NOT buy until Amazon works out the glitches.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles Travis Canfield"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this.
