For $40 I would more carefully weigh my options but I think this would have still been the best price for easy video streaming on the TV. Also the hardware has a lot of potential, if I get the free time to explore. Boots and operates pretty fast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael A.

Had to watch a tutorial that seemed to go on forever on how to plug the stick into HDMI and navigate.  Not terrible but you can't skip it, so small gripe but annoying nonetheless.  Loved going through photos on it and video playback was great.  Miss not having HBO GO but I knew it going in, here's hoping.Also, love the fact I could connect to 5Ghz band.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "me"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I purchased my fire stick from Best Buy.
