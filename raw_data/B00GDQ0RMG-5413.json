[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "REALLY wanted to love it. I'm an Apple fan, but always look to new tech and gadgets when I can. Apple TV is getting stagnant, with no hopes of new product on the horizon. I got in on the Fire TV Stick for $19, so what'd I have to lose?I was very pleased with the speed of the interface, the intuitiveness of the UI, all the areas where the ATV was lagging. However, my pleasure was quickly snuffed out. The device POPPED a time or two and went to a staticy gray screen, then just as quickly went back to normal. Frequent buffering. Some apps (WatchESPN comes to mind) would turn the screen green, then slowly pixelate back to normal.Called Amazon Customer Service (one driver for my 1-star review) INSISTS on speaking with you in person. Whatever. Went through her obvious scripts, and shocker, they offered to send me a new one. They overnighted it, but I basically had the same issues. The second device locked up more than the first one, however, so I decided I'd had enough.Plugged the 2nd-gen AppleTV in. While it lacks the speed and modern interface, it kills the FireTV Stick in stability. I'll wait for the AppleTV 4.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "FILTHYC"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is exactly as advertised.  Easy to set up and use.

It is extremely fast and scrolling is smooth.  Streaming if fantastic, especially Amazon content.  Searching only searching Amazon content, not the \"apps\" installed like Netflix and Hulu.  If you use Amazon Music and upload pictures to Amazon Cloud, this seamlessly imports everything in.Except...  A button on the remote controls stopped working.  Amazon support has done a great job of taking care of the issue for me and are replacing the entire unit (although it is out of stock and will take about two-weeks to get here).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NB \"NB\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Not also do you have to buy the fire stick but you have to buy everything that is on it.
