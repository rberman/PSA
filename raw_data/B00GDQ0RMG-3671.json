It performed extremely well, only difficulty experienced was the \"streaming speed\" of the internet provided, which obviously has nothing to do with the Stick. I like that it is small and out of the way. Highly recommend it over Apple TV, which I also have, but use the \"stick\" while on vacation and to access Amazon Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Bielagus"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this thing!
