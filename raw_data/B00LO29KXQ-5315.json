It will be worth 5 stars one day.  Right now the apps are very buggy.  My girls watch Disney Jr and the app resets a lot.  Same goes for the history channel app.  Things just seem buggy.  The amazon content seems to work well, but the secondary applications need work. The device can hide behind a TV that is mounted on the wall.  Mine has a powered usb right next to the hdmi so I didn't have to worry about power adaptor.  The Fire remote is nice, but if you have little ones keep it away from them because it is very small and can be hidden very well.  Once this has been out and the bugs worked out this will be an awesome tool.  I do wish I could cast video similar to the chromcast.  That would be a nice feature.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "EEdesigner83"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought the Amazon Fire TV and loved it so much I bought the Fire TV Stick for the bedroom.

I just wish the 10 sec. skip back/ahead feature would work on all the apps, such as Netflix. It's a great feature that works well with prime products. The menu screen is perfect. HBO!! Oh, never mind. It's a bait and switch. The first season is free, then $25 per season after that. Lose.
