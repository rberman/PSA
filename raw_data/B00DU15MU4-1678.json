Bought it about 3 weeks ago and I have hbogo, netflix, and Prime all in one. Very convenient. I used to use my Xbox 360 but was a hassle to have to turn it all every time.

There are starting to be more and more apps.I stream Amazon Instant, Netflix, Amazon Prime Music, CBSN BBC and Sky news.The YouTube apps are CLUNKY and SLOW on their search interfaces.There are several games that I enjoy that work well with the game controller. (Takes a while to figure the controller out.)I would like to see a home screen located off (or sleep) button. The only way to go into sleep mode is to scroll through all of the menu to settings and select sleep. For the first month or two it went into sleep mode automatically after the television was turned off. It doesn't seem to do that anymore. (might be one of the apps staying active in the background).The only other thing that I would like to see is a way to access information on where the stunning screen saver pictures were taken.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "like it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Denise"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Its excellent.

If you are replacing cable all you will need from your provider is an internet connection then you can return your providers set-top-boxes. I setup my box with HBO GO, Showtime and HULU and I have just as much if not more programming available as your cable provider. I have experienced a brief 30sec lag when starting up my hulu programming with verizon fios 50/50 but otherwise I get kazillion hulu shows.  I didnt give it a 5-star because of the 30-second lag on bringing up your hulu show.
