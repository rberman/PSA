My play station 3 just gave out on me completely. I was using it only for the smart aspect since my bluray stopped working 2 years ago. Fire sticks user interface is so easy and smooth to use it's amazing. Opening it up and having amaZOn prime directly in your face is great. I got this for 19.99 during the two day special. I didn't expect to be this happy about it and I am.It pushes Dolby digital plus audio and 1080p video. Loads fast. Remote is easy to use. Interface is straight forward.I have an iPhone so i can't mirror my device...that would be my only con. I would love for amaZOn to create a bluray player with this user interface. It would be an instant purchase for me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Moon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works very well, smooth navigating, easy setup.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Frank Sambol"}]
