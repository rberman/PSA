I am a Roku user for the most part and like the volume of content provided free on Roku especially when partnered with www.playon.tv... but with a PRIME membership more recent content is available via Prime.For the record I can get Prime using Roku and PlayOn... but there is a notable difference in speed of access with the Fire TV stick... and too the shows play in succession with the stick.  With my other method I have to start each show (when watching a TV series).Great addition to my TV arsenal!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kitcatvi"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "waste of money", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "terry"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really like it,too bad that in Costa Rica doesn't do a lot with the apps.,most of all I use to wath Netflix and some times youtube.Bu tis really easy to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Olger cordero vega"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So fast.
