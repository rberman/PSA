Serrano"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very easy to set-up.  Works well with an HDMI switch, for a TV with only one or two HDMI slots.  No RCA-type stereo output jacks, so I can't connect the sound to an amplifier or home theater setup.  Still working on a couple of technical bugs - some TV video does not appear in full screen format, and sometimes the wireless signal to the Fire Stick seems to become too weak.  Could be a problem with my cable provider.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "P. Carson \"Audiobook Raven\""}]
