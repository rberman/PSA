I have a ChromeCast purchased a couple years ago, but was going to use FireStick on my 2 other TVs.  What a disappointment!  It would disconnect or not connect at all over 50% of the time.Returning for refund and will stick with ChromeCast which has never had a problem staying connected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Msocks"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is the first streaming service I have used so I am no expert by any stretch. Please take my review with a grain of salt.INSTALLATION: Simple. Straightforward. Truly a plug-n-play experience. Just plug it in to an HDMI port and the charger to an wall outlet and your ready to go. The tutorial (once stick is connected) helps as well.CONTENT:  Of course all of Amazon Prime's content is available, so no surprises there. Plenty of content for adults and kids and everything in between. There are a lot of apps available, but some (like ESPN) require an active cable subcription to watch.EXPERIENCE: The menu system is straight forward, with Amazon's content front and center. Evrything you could want to view with the Prime world is available on the stick, so if you're happy with the subscription on your computer you will be pleased with the Fire Stick. There are apps for standalone platforms (Liek HBO G, ESPN, Netfilx, etc.) that can increase your content tremendously.GAMES: This is very similar to android experience in that you download content to your stick and your ready to go. There is an optional controller that you can buy that can increase the number of games you can play (like Sonic!!!), so there should be real growth happening here.CONCLUSION: Everything from the sleek design of the remote to the esae of navigation of the menu makes for an expereince that keeps you entertained for hours upon hours. There is plenty of content for the whole family, and with the addition of apps that require paid subscritions (like HBO Go) this is a hard deal to beat!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "superslidestyle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Valued Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "When I received the Fire TV stick a little over a month ago and my son connected it to our TV, I couldn't have been happier with it.  Watching Netflix and Amazon Prime is the best.  However, a few days ago the stick programming, I.e.,  while watching shows and/or playing games, it would freeze up.  After a few days of this,  we are unable to access anything.  We have installed and reinstalled our stick, in addition to checking the source, which checked out to be good, strong connection.  I continue to receive messages that there is no time information and a series of different numbers.  Will Amazon replace it or is there something else I should try?Update: Spoke w/Amazon and after trying to find problem with my Fire TV stick, they sent me a new stick (not the whole package) and it's working beautifully and hope it continues to do so.  Thank you so much Amazon.  This little contraption is part of me now and I don't want to be without it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Vintagemom \"45\""}]
