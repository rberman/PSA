Just plug it in to the HDMI jack, change the television output and sign in. You can even watch YouTube on it by using the YouTube app online.  The only problem is that my TV is old and has only two HDMI jacks and one was for my cable and the other for my Blu-Ray/DVD. I solved it easily enough by using a standard Red, Yellow, White RCA cable to attach the Blu-Ray instead. Now all three work fine together perfectly. Now I don't have to squint at my tablet anymore.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Confederate"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've been meaning to buy this and was mentally hitting myself on the head for not purchasing it when it was $19. I was delighted to see that it went on sale for $34! I was not disappointed! It's so much better than my previous roku xd since it takes up so little space on my TV table (as in, it doesn't take up space at all since it's as small as a usb thumb drive that attaches to the side of my TV).Nevertheless, it would have been nice if it worked like a usb thumb drive and all I needed to do was plug it to the TV without needing to connect it to a power source as well. I found out my TV doesn't have a usb port and was bummed I had to plug it to a power source. Despite that, it's still a pretty neat gadget! I have amazon prime, netflix, and hulu and it's so much better watching my shows on the big screen instead of my computer!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "colormeviolet"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I had the Roku which I returned 24 hours after buying and bought the Fire Stick instead.
