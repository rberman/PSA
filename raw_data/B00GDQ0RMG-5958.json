[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love the concept, but doesn't have as many games as Fire TV.  My son loves Minion Rush and I thought since it was available on Fire TV, it would also be available on the Stick, but it is not.  :-(  Other than that, I am able to use the things I use regularly like Amazon Videos and Netflix, so I am content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mrs. Reynolds"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is awesome we own 4.

It would not even connect to my primary network, despite repeated fiddling.  Not what I need after a long day at work with overtime. I gave up and had it connect to my other network, which is a much weaker signal, by the way, so that was not the issue for me.  However it refused to update despite repeated attempts, restarting the device, etc.I am returning it as defective and recommend anyone else with hardware/software issues to do so, also.  As I told Amazon in the comment for the return, I don't have time to debug beta crap.  I bet they eat millions on this.  Very disappointing.EDIT: So, this morning, I decided to give it another chance.  It did managed to update, which it apparently needed to do several times before finally starting up and playing a fairly decent welcome help video.  However, this was still on the secondary network.  Encouraged I decided to see if it would now properly connect ... sadly, no.  For the record, there is nothing exotic about my network; it's a common home router model using WPA2-PSK encryption. I do have a MAC address access list but the device was added and I have even disabled that to no avail, just in case.  For whatever reason this device is just not properly designed or configured, oddly the other network is similarly configured, though further away so a weaker signal and not preferred as it is a satellite, metered, connection.  The upshot is that I will keep the device as it may be useful, even if only for another charger, given the price I paid. There is no way I can recommend this device though and I still think it merits 1 star, for the total lack of attention to technical detail, horrible out of the box experience, etc.  If you can get it as cheap as I did ($20) and you are prepared to take a chance on it not working for you, have at it, otherwise there are a host of better products. The remote, though, is not bad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "11/14", "author": "Gaidheal"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "We got ours on black Friday from Best Buy. Great features, easy to use, but offers a horrible connection. Initially we had it in our second floor with our router in the basement. It barely worked. So we moved it to the T.V. in the basement, feet from our router and it still loses the network connection every 30 minutes or so. We have not had connection issues with our Sony Bluray player or Roku. Really disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "Jill M.

Otherwise, I completely love this device and the direction this technology is going!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "jenn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic device.  I switched from a Revue and ROKU to these sticks!  I wanted something smaller that would allow me complete access to all of my streaming content no matter the television I was on.  These sticks give me that ability.  I don't game and the ONLY thing I use these for is streaming video and audio from various sources.  With HBO GO part of Prime and the SHO app, I have all my streaming content availalbe to me.The Android remote is the fastest I have found.  It is as fast of the actual handheld remote that came with the device.  Speaking of the device itself, it was an absolute breeze to setup.  Plug power into device, plug device into TV, and follow the on screen prompts.  I would recommend a good mid to high end router with wireless a or wireless n to make streaming that much stronger and easier.I would recommend this device to anyone who wants great streaming and also a small foot print.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Volzbalz"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Crashed 4 times in first 10 minutes.

I purchased two when the pre orders originally went up for sale. One for myself, one as a gift.I received my units yesterday, and I popped mine into the back of my TV. It kept rebooting from the Amazon Screen. The device itself actually recommended I use it in a wall outlet, so even though I could see the ugly wire going to my wall outlet, I obliged. Okay, now it's ready, Woot! Initial update. Okay, should be just a couple of minutes...20 minutes later, it has finished. Sweet, let's go. Oh, now it's installing? 5-6 minutes later, it's ready to be setup. Welcome Joseph P******e. Would you like to continue with your account or another? Well, this one I'm using for myself, so my account. Where do I put in my password? I don't? My Mastercard number is XXXXXX? So, if I gave this as a gift, anyone can just purchase apps, movies and TV shows on my account? Not cool.So, I have to go and put it in Parental Control so that the wife and family does not make purchases by accident, as she is not as up to speed with what is included at no extra cost in the movie and TV section (seeing that our other devices ask to verify a credit or debit card for each transaction) So, lets look for apps to add to this thing. Hmmm... buy this movie for 9.99, rent this for 3.99, where do I go to download apps? Let me use the search feature. WWE Network, lost connection. OK, lets go back home, WiFi is still connected, WWE Network, lost connection. Alright, it's new, lets soft reset it and pull the plug for a minute. It's back up. Search for WWE Network, black screen.I navigate a bit more, here is the apps menu at the bottom. They are organized by category. No option for all, in alphabetical order? Maybe I'm missing something, and can search, but if I did, it's not user friendly enough for me to plug and play like other popular options. Finished downloading my favorites.Lets try these games, should be fun to use between movies and shows. Download Flappy Bird, Kart Racer and a few others. Unplayable. The remote lags every minute or so. Left, Left, Left, nothing... then all of a sudden those three lefts activate. Now i'm off the track and behind. Lets try Flappy Bird. Jump, Jump, Jump (OK, this seems like it was meant for this) Jump (no reaction) darn. Now that action button presses, when it asks to continue.Nevermind, let me just stream something from WWE Network. Menu, Shows, PPV, Royal Rumble, Play, lost connection. Go home, go back in repeat, it plays for 30 seconds... lost connection.I'm sure with some updates this will get better in time, but I am not a patient person. I decided to return both devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "72/87", "author": "sonofsicily"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!!! Movie start playing faster than a DVD! I have the slowest internet you can buy to! So easy to hook up that I did it in 2 min ( and I'm terrible at that stuff). Even has an instructional video when you get it started!!! Love love love!
