I had my router right next to the TV and it still would not connect. The Fire TV said the wifi connection was very strong, but it would still not play any movies, ever. I would suggest spending extra money in buying a better product or make sure you have a perfect internet connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sofia"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Amazon Prime is the worst. It is always buffering it loses connection in the middle of the movies and I have High speed internet. I have tried them all and NEVER have had a problem with (NETFLIX)!!!!! Plus all the good movies and TV shows you have to rent. I would not recommend Prime or Fire Stick.DCTECMO.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DCTECMO"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "its not what I expected for it to be.

I don't have this problem with any other PC, laptop, or tablet streaming video in my home.

It has a clunky interface for searching. The phone app that is supposed to go with it to make searching easier, is painfully slow (on my galaxy s4).  I did enjoy watching youtube videos with it (the only thing that was free). I just wasn't expeciting every item that I drilled down on to ask for money.

Just wish they made the PRIME videos/ shows more visable.  There are way to many shows that cost too much money.  Too much to even rent.  I can go to rent them for a dollar.  But the ones i get for free are great, and i have sacrificed and bought a few seasons of certain shows.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "RC Petty"}]
