[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "The fireTV stick requires USB power (at least with my TV), which is annoying for a wall mounted TV which may not have an outlet present.  I tried to be clever and use the USB port on my TV (Sharp Aquos LED) and it appeared to work!  However, I found that when navigating side-to-side in the menus withing the fireTV stick, the device would crash and restart.  To troubleshoot I tried plugging into the provided power adapter and the crashes went away.I'd consider this a bug: with the USB power; the device should either power on and work consistently, or not power on if the USB power source is inadequate.  Strangely, streaming an HD video it works fine, only when navigating the menus (especially scrolling side-to-side).  I hope this is something they can fix in a software/firmware update so that users don't have to run a separate power cord to the back of their TV when most TVs these days have USB ports.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "GearTraveller \"world traveller\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Is anyone else having problems with it constantly pausing? Not sure what is going on, but ever few minutes, the stick pauses and i have to hit play again in order for it to work. Note that this is not a streaming issue, in that the streaming circle does not appear, rather, whatever we are watching, it randomly flickers and then pauses the show.I have updated the firmware too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/5", "author": "snowcow"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This product could be awesome if the workout the fickleness of program settings.

Right out of the box, in just a few minutes I set it up using my home WiFi and accessed Netflix. The ONLY feature that could be improved would be to make it easier to open the battery compartment of the remote. Amazingly, it took me 2 minutes to slide the cover open. I guess, even in the best of families are a few black sheep, but what the heck--now I know I need to use a thin blade to pop it open.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Patrick L"}]
