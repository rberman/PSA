I'm now going to attempt a troubleshooting step that i found online, which is to put it in the hdmi extension provided (around 2 inch extension). If this does solve my problem, i'll provide an update, but this is not something that a device like this should have as a requirement to work.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "M.
