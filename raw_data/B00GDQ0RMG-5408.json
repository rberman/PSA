It's due to my working in video streaming tech arena for many years.I was excited to pick the FireTV stick up for $19 as an early customer.  Glad that's all I paid.  I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I am not all that thrilled with it.  The menus are slow, there is a lag from me clicking remote and the onscreen udpate.  I've accidentally clicked on wrong choice quite a few times.  Very frustrating.  I have already updated FW to latest.There is a lack of integration for searching across content.  It's (obviously) geared toward Amazon Prime, but I also subscribed to Netflix, Hulu, Crackle, VUDU, Amazon Prime, Crunchyroll, HBO, ESPN, Apple Store, Google Play and various other services (yes, really, I need to be able to test among all the major streaming services).I like the Chromecast, especially now that it has integration and abilities to \"cast\" content from other devices.  My kids love it, and we travel with several for use in hotel room TVs.FireTV stick seem to be geared toward Prime only and everything else is second thoughts.  I really like GoogleTV's ability to search across all streaming services that the box has installed and you are signed into.  Very nice integration.  Too bad it's not updated anymore.I would not paid more than the $19 I got this for.  It's disappointingly slow and clunky, slow menus.  Does not support as many streaming services and the apps are only from Amazon store, which is not as good as Google Play store.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/6", "author": "Amazon Customer \"tin man\""}]
