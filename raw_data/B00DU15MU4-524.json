[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Fire TV comes pre-configured and ready to use. I plugged mine into the HDMI port on my stereo receiver at home and plugged the included AC adapter into an outlet. Turned on my TV and the Fire TV product instantly brought up a brief set if instructions to show me how to use it and allowed me to configure it to access my home Wi-Fi router. Everything was quick and easy to set up, and I was browsing free Prime video content in no time at all. It was easy to stream the free Prime videos and view them on my TV.If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber, Amazon Fire TV is a no-brainer. It is a low-cost way to stream TV and movies that are free with your Prime membership right to your home TV set. The content streams smoothly, and the included remote control is easy to use. Purchase it now, you won't regret it.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Chris DeHart"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Everything was as advertised and content good, but man, the remote works great then sometimes just will not pair. Following the troubleshooting recommendations are useless and I just hit buttons and replace batteries then suddenly it works.

My husband and I are both \"low tech\" people and we have no difficulty using it. We also use it to access both Hulu and Netflix.  My only complaint would be that theres not a lot that we are particularly interested in included in prime- almost anything we like we have to rent- I understand Amazon needs to make money too but they dont offer and buyers rewards really or a discount if we bought so many. You would also think some of the old movies would be on prime but still cost $4.99 to rent.  They should perhaps do a step down system that rents older movies for less- we would definetly use it more! Now we rent our child a movie at 4.99 once a month if it was 2.00 we  would rent something every weekend.  Other then that we like it and intend to keep using it if nothing else for Netflix and hulu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "praby19"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SM"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I bought Amazon TV thinking I was going to get a lot of free TV and movies to watch; boy was I wrong. Almost everything my wife and I wanted to watch, you had to pay. If you thought you were getting \"free\" HBO with HBO GO, nope. It is not free. You have to have an HBO account in order to use this, so what is the point?I have ATT Uverse and with that, if I wanted HBO I had to pay for it, so what is the need for Amazon TV? Nothing.I wanted to watch older TV classics, Andy Griffith Show, Dick Van Dyke Show, you had to pay for it. I wanted to watch The Godfather, had to pay for it. So why did I need Amazon TV? I don't. Game of Thrones season 1, had to pay for it.Save your money folks if you already have a smart TV and use your apps. Spend $9.95 a month if you want HBO and you don't need this box.Read the fine print, do your homework before you purchase this box. It wasn't a big waste of money as I can return it, but it sure was hyped like you were getting a lot, well, not so much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Just_Me"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!

If you have a prime account this is the way to go.  I had Chromecast and it doesn't even compare to this jewel. Easy to use, When to order form Amazon Prime it is all ready to .

The user interface is easy enough to use, but as a cord cutter, I still find myself having to jump back and forth between my Fire TV and Apple TV for certain shows and networks, so for that I'd give it 3 stars. I took advantage of the Holiday $69 sale, and for that price, you really cannot complain. Even at $99 I'd be hard pressed to complain too much.
