Software works half the time. Interface freezes way too often. I get booted out of my apps, which I presume means the app has crashed. Very disappointed with this poorly performing Amazon product. I'll have to wait for some sort of software update and hope it gets better. As a point of reference, I also have a 1st Gen Sony Google TV and it is way more responsive... I originally thought this was going to be an upgrade to the GTV, I was WRONG!! Amazon needs to fix this mess.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Ken"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Glitches  do occur, but works well most of the time.  Acts up when trying to go thru menus and sometimes fast forwards during tv shows and movies. Maybe it needs upgrading, if possible, please try to fix these problems.  Would make the entire experience a great one.
