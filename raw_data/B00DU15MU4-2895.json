The Plex app on the Fire TV is awesome - just awesome.I am ordering another for our bedroom - very powerful.Now if ESPN and DirecTV would get on their horses and sign an agreement I would be all set!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BSomms3"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a very great product.

I'll pause Netflix and every time I come back it is back on the \"choose your experience\" screen. Annoying as I will never choose Netflix Kids. Then I have to drill back down, looking for the series I have been watching. Then it buffers before restarting. In contrast, the Apple TV was alway right where I left it. Navigation is odd.

We've quickly adopted the Fire TV as a multi-faceted family entertainment center for games, tv, videos, etc.  This does way more than an Apple TV or Roku.  We've enthusiastically added about 30 apps that we really like.  The problem is that it quickly runs out of memory.  The games in particular consume a lot of storage space (especially the rich graphics games like Asphalt 8).  So we've already reached the memory limit in just a few weeks.We've got about 30 apps total (including the usual suspects like Netflix, YouTube and a handful of games like SevZero, BombSquad, and Asphalt 8 - which I'm told consumes a ton of storage space) and received a message saying to remove apps otherwise performance will slow down.  So, after only using this for a few weeks, we've had to remove some apps from the player.That's a bit of a bummer.  I wish the usb plug could be used to expand app storage.  That would make this a scalable gaming/entertainment platform for people like us who aren't mainstream console players (we don't have an XBox or Playstation).Otherwise, we've been really happy with the Fire TV and highly recommend it.  I'm also guessing that the interface may get refined over time to make it easier to view long lists.  Right now, scrolling through 50+ large thumbnails of movies/content, can be time consuming.  Guessing they'll enable the user to select a smaller thumbnail grid view at some point.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "juice_man"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I would love to get Amazon Fire TV. It's just that there are so few channel choices for national and world news. Include at least 10 news channels (BBC, France 24, CNN International, NHK, etc.), 10 arts channels (Sky Arts, CBC Television, DW TV, etc.) and 10 overseas entertainment channels (TV Monde, etc.), then I'm DEFINITELY buying Amazon TV because it would be great to watch these channels on my 42-inch HDTV rather than my smartphone or PC \u2014 and without the cable TV price and reception hassles.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Moore No Less"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Amazon Fire TV works great!

For someone who mainly watches Amazon Prime, Hulu+, Crackle and/or Netflix, they would probably be happy with either device, for someone who would use the channels that required a cable or satellite subscription to access, then Roku would be the better device, however if Android based games are your thing, then AFTV becomes the device to get. If it wasn't for the developer mode and the ability to sideload apps, I probably would have given 3, maybe 4 stars because it wouldn't have been much different from other devices already available.Pro's:Easy to navigateAndroid GamesDeveloper modeSmall deviceMost of the channels I used on Roku are already available on AFTVCon's:Limited apps (I know they just started, and more apps are on the way)Limited storage (Probably enough for the average user, personally I've already been told to delete some apps because I was low on storage.)I ALSO BOUGHT: - The Amazon game controller to play more games. - Mini Wireless Entertainment Keyboard with Touchpad for use of the developer mode since many of the apps I've sideloaded require a mouse and/or keyboard to navigate. (NOTE: The average user will not need the keyboard/mouse functions.)EDIT: (May 19, 2014) - Reduced from 5 stars to 4 stars. Although I have no performance problems with AFTV, it's just the lack of storage space is ridiculous! Some of these games are over 2.5GB, which means you can only have 1, maybe 2 larger games installed at a time. If you want to reinstall it later, then you'll have to wait a few hours to redownload that huge 2.5 GB file again. This device has a USB port, but the only use I've found for it is a wireless USB keyboard/mouse. It needs to at least allow us to download these large files to a USB drive so if we can quickly reinstall the app at a later date.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "JimBou1981"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have Apple TV and I decided to try the Fire TV for my bedroom TV or be able to place it in the guest room when I have company.
