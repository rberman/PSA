[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "Pros:  Works well and easy to set up.  It has a great price.  It is readily portable.  It seems like it has nice capabilities but so far is underutilized by its designers.  For example, the 'casting' feature through the chrome browser has promise but its not easy always to get chrome to play rather than download things you'd like to cast.Cons:  Far too few apps for me to use this seriously.  The Roku iii does every thing this does (except 'cast'), but the Roku does far more, too.  What functionality casting gives me can easily be achieved with Flex on the Roku.  There is no way to interface with Chromecast except wireless.  On setup it is not secured and I haven't figured out a way to secure it.  I find that disconcerting.  Perhaps it is not a big deal, but I'd much rather be able to secure it to prevent strangers from messing with it.Only two stars because of the serious lack of apps right now and limited functionality with casting really limits it usefulness to me.  With Flex I have been able to cast anything I've tried so far but it can be choppy and is less than ideal.  I generally really like google products and I'm optimistic this will improve further with time.  As more apps become available and if casting becomes more robust I may upgrade my rating", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven H"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!

I normally use my iPad to hook up to hotel televisions to watch stuff I bring with me or stream. But that's usually kind of inconvenient when you're searching for things to watch and don't really want to get out of bed. This was just finally getting in stock and the price was perfect, so I thought I would check it out!But, unfortunately if you're looking to use it in a hotel, you'll have no luck 8 times out of 10 because you are using the hotels wifi network. Which doesn't really play well with letting different devices connect to one another, for obvious reasons. If your hotel provided a wired connection you could always bring a router and create your own wifi network in the room. But that's getting a little in depth. I have heard of people using their computers as the routers while using the hotel's wifi. Again, sounded like a bit over my head.So since I couldn't use it for that, I figured I would hook it up to my guest room tv. And I have to say, it's pretty awesome! Right now there are only 3 apps for it, Netflix, Youtube, and Android Play. As of this writing the there is a develop program going which will bring many more apps in the near future. It will basically become a pocket Roku device.It's easy to setup and pretty much anyone on your network has access to it. So if you have a friend over and they want to show you something on youtube, they can just stream it using their phone. That's awesome! And the Netflix app is pretty good too! It's kind of crazy when you are using your phone as video streaming device for your 50\" TV and it looks great.Also another cool feature was the Chrome browser extension. It basically turns your browser into an airplay like device. Whatever you are looking at is reflected on the TV. I can imagine this being really handy for presentations or even a fantasy football draft.The build quality is solid. It doesn't feel like plastic and actually has some weight to it. It also has a external power adapter if you're using a TV that doesn't have HDMI 1.4 (I guess 1.4 lets you power devices and I think you will mostly only find it on 2013 TV's)So even though I couldn't use it for the reason I bought it, I still really like it. And at $35 it's cheap enough to pick up an check out, if only to use as a Netflix device. And once the 3rd party apps come out of beta, I think this thing will be huge. There are rumors that you will eventually be able to play content directly from your phone. That would solve my hotel network issue!I absolutely recommend this product.  I would have given it 5 stars if they already had the option to do something like Wifi Direct, where you just beam from your phone directly to the Chromecast without a network. There are rumors of that coming through updates too! But even if the rumors don't come true, I'm pretty sure Hulu is coming and maybe even Amazon Prime!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Stew11b"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "...but only support of less apps.
