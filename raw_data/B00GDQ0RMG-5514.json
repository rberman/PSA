[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far I love it!I just got this fire stick. Installed easily. Make sure you first have an amazon account so you can sign in.Make sure you have a wireless router as this has to hook and works with wireless. I bought two of these, one for me and one for my mom. She does not have a wireless Linksys so I had to buy one of those for her (in addition to the fire stick).Also make sure you have an HDMI port in your TV. Okay, duh ...We all like this fire stick and can't imagine that we waited this long to get it. The movies are great and I like the fact that I can put something I am watching on hold and come back at a later time to see the rest without losing my place.I recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Soapy \"Soapy\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great little box.

Streaming and quality is flawless even three floors away from my cranky wireless router. And the ease of setup! So awesome to have something that works immediately and so well the very first time out of the box. Bravo, Amazon. Now, please improve the remote just a bit by adding bumps or something on the buttons so I know what I'm doing in the dark. Or lights. Customizable illumination in the remote would be rad. And more video included with Prime...And maybe an app to view Amazon order progress and tracking...word.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christopher Collins"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "For the price, you can't beat it.
