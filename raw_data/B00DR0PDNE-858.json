However, in my case, the Chromecast App installed on my Galaxy Tab 3 with Android Kitkat is a Beta Version, so, i'ts not able to do what it's meant to.Whenever I press Cast Screen it trys to proceed but the process finishes inmediatly. As I said, it's a BETA version so maybe, maybe in a nearly future it'll do what it should.Because of that, I had to try many different third party applications, with their advantages and disadvantages, with advertisements, etc. I found 2 or 3 that I found usefull for my needs.In my case, Im a teacher and I wanted to use Chromecast in my classes to give them a better looking and a more interactive environment. However, because of the limitations of those third party applications, I couldn't say I'll be able to fully achive what I wanted.I give to the product 3 stars not because of its quality but because of the lack of a software that can fully take advantage of its potential.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carlos A.
