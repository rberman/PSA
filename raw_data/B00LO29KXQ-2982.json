[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy. Remote is awesome. A little clunker interface when using other apps to watch video, but maybe I just haven't explored it enough. I enjoy it more than my AppleTV.

However, when accessing Netflix the service is sporadic at best. I have called customer service and they have admitted that there is a software glitch that they are trying to work out but it hasn't been corrected yet. Hopefully someday the glitch will be fixed and the device will perform as promised. I would like to be satisfied with this product but right now it does not perform as advertised.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Colleen R.
