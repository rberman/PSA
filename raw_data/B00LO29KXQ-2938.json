[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you have Amazon Prime, it seems like a real no brainer to have the Fire TV Stick as well.  Much easier to use with the TV than my laptop.

I was a bit hesitant to \"cut the cord\" but, considering the cost-to-benefit along with Prime Membership, it can't be beat.First and regarding the Prime Membership (getting the Fire TV Stick pushed me over the edge), the two-day shipping is a great perk if you haven't had it before.  If you were like me, you waited until you had enough stuff in your shopping cart to qualify for free shipping.  Now, it's not a concern and I receive the items post haste.  Add that to free movies, TV shows, and music and we have a winner.  Averaged out over 12 mos, the cost of getting prime is a little over $8 per month--similar to Netflix and other streaming services.  However, add in the music and the free, two-day shipping, and it can't be beat.  While I can't exactly say it has every movie or show--or for that matter, live, local sports--Prime has enough to keep any Movie/TV junkie happy and cable-free (at a greatly reduced cost, I might add).As to the Fire TV Stick itself, while you can use a tablet or smart phone to act as a remote, I prefer the simplicity of the remote and being able to feel buttons (as against an icon on a screen).  Further and for those like myself who listen to music in different rooms, it doesn't require line of sight to work--so you can jump past soundtracks you don't like.  The stick is a neat toy--but to make it something worthwhile, something of value--you need to accompany it with that Prime Membership.And there's nothing like the thought of reducing the amount of scratch you used to pay the cable company for lousy movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Harvey D.
