I said the content was too expensive.  But since I haven't been to a new movie for over twenty years, I was wrong.  Anything over a year old only costs $3 or $4 dollars to rent so I think it's going  to be a very good deal.  I plan to buy an Amazon Fire TV over the next week and give it a go.  I think the Fire TV Box has more oomph and I plan to have my small router close by to minimize internet skips and jumps.  I hope I didn't put anyone off with my first negative review.  I apologize to Jeff Bezos and all of the good people at Amazon.  I'll write another review, in a month or so, that gives  the box a fair trial.  Also the amazon return and customer service was great as always.

I prefer Ethernet over Wi-Fi, and just today, it starting reporting that it couldn't find the Home page yet showed not only connected to the network, but very good signal. I had to disconnect and reconnect a couple of times before it found its Home page. I hope this doesn't become an every day problem. Plus, unlike the Fire TV, this won't let you play YouTube over it from your computer. I was disappointed to discover that. I guess if you use some app and Android device, you can, but the Fire TV works directly with a PC.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael O'Malley"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick was so terrible.
