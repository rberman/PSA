[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Received and had it hooked up within a couple hours.  It was very easy to hook up.  The hardest part was getting at where we had to plug it in our TV.  Once we had it plugged in we were able to set it up and were ready to start watching movies, games and much more.  I was able to load Netflex on my Kindle Fire as well as my computer.  Really love this - no extra box to junk up my entertainment center.  Thanks Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Judith Pommerenke"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Plugged it in and it works like a champ!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeffrey Lee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love love love my firestick.

I purchased on an impulse to see what it's like.  Not being a Prime member, I'm very disappointed in the amount of free or low cost content that's available.  I hate the cable company and the idea of paying for TV content--especially the same content that is typically broadcast for free and I'd not watch at all if it was not \"on\" at the moment and free on TV.  In short, based on my quick scan of available options and content, Fire TV is not a real alternative to paying for TV content or a way to \"cut the cord\" for cable in a meaningful sense. At most, it allows you to pay Amazon instead of the cable company, and possibly save money if you watch little TV and therefore pay for only what you really want (but $2-3 per episode would add up fast and eliminate any possible savings for many users).Why is it taking so long for content providers to treat (live and recorded) streaming as just another public broadcast medium (like the airwaves) from which they can profit in the traditional way--paid advertising--without charging users for access?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Scott E Davis"}]
