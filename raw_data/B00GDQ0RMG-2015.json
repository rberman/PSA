[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "If I could give this thing LESS then one star I would! I have a 47\" visio thts only a few years old. Fire stick doesn't work! It skips....it makes a crackling noise....it pauses...thn blacks out. The only thing tht lets me get through the tv show is if i shut it down after the pic goes black. Ive talked to customer service abt the issues and their useless. No one knows how to fix this! Definitely does not have all the bugs worked out. Hate this thing so much it prompted me to get a new smart tv. I hate this thing! Anyone who gave this thing more then one star either works for amazon or is getting paid to give it a good review.

For what it avails in just the basic unit you procure from Amazon is rather unbelievable. What you get is an overload of video. (Oh yah, you need to be prime to take advantage of all the free stuff) there is a bounty of many other free and for minimal cost apps that are compatible with this stick.
