It'll be even better once the ios app is released. It does everything we need. We used to access Netflix and Prime TV through our Wii, but the battery life of the wiimotes was terrible and we needed to reboot the wii every time we wanted to watch Netflix. We got this, plugged it in, downloaded the Netflix app and we're off and running. We've had only minor buffering issues, not enough to take a star.

The system seems to have a problem authenticating into a network after a bit of use. It seems to loose the password and says that you \"authentication problems.\"  The only fixes that I've found to date are restarting the system by unplugging it or holding down the select and play button for five seconds to restart it.  I've tried this with three different routers and they all have had the same problems. All my other devices have been fine during the testing.I hope Amazon determines the problem ans issues a patch soon!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Eric/Mira"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Prime will not play on my HD TV.
