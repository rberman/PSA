[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works pretty good for what it is.  Wish it would have some more features to it. But it still gets a lot of use out of it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J. Hess"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I already own a PS3, and I usually just use that with my TV for things like playing Blu-Ray movies, watching Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and things like that. However, my wife and wanted something a little more portable that we could take with us to use in hotels while we\u2019re travelling. We saw how popular the Chromecast was and thought it would make for a good substitute that we could easily take with us on the road.  Here\u2019s my take on it.Pros:It IS extremely portable and easy to take with you. The pricing is also pretty reasonable, and it ships really quickly. Setup was fast and relatively painless, and it\u2019s worked very fluidly with my Samsung Galaxy S4 so far. I pair to the hotel\u2019s Wi-Fi, connect to the Chromecast, and can instantly watch stuff on Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, etc. So far the audio/video quality has been pretty good too which is nice that I don\u2019t have to sacrifice in those departments.Cons:Very limited as to what you can actually watch on the Chromecast. You have a set list of certain applications that it will work with, but beyond that, not much you can do with it. It would be AWESOME if you could exactly mirror what\u2019s on your phone, tablet, or laptop onto your TV, but alas, the Chromecast has an extremely limited functionality that does not extend beyond a few apps. Also, it\u2019s a huge bummer that it doesn\u2019t work with Amazon Instant Video, because Netflix and Hulu don\u2019t always cover everything I feel like watching. Lastly, it stinks that it requires an external power source beyond the HDMI port it plugs into. If your TV has a USB port or an AC plug nearby, great, but if not, you\u2019re screwed because you won\u2019t be able to power your Chromecast.Conclusion:All griping aside, the Chromecast is still a pretty good device. Not perfect, and it certainly has its drawbacks, but if you\u2019re looking for an easy way to watch Netflix or a few other popular applications on your TV without a gaming system or streaming device like a Roku, the Chromecast is a cheap and easy fix. Just be aware of its limitations before purchasing.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A Boy Named Sue"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am very happy with the Chromecast.

I was surprised at how good the picture is on an old TV. I use my cell phone and tablet to control it and I like the way the application works on my phone as well. Even when the screen goes to sleep you don't have to unlock the entire phone to access the controls for the TV app. for the price can't be beat.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DEP"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Because it's an awesome device and I would recommend it to everyone! user friendly, straight forward and not a headache to install", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Not Pleased"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Not enough channels, very limited use, I don't use it anymore.
