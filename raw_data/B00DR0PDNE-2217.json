I cannot do either.  The amount of apps that Chromecast supports is quite limited.  It does not include MLB AtBat, NFL GamePass, or any sports steaming app for that matter.  Unless your an HBO subscriber or you like watching YouTube videos all day, its tablet streaming features are weak.If you are streaming from the Chrome browser, you can only stream from within one tab.  This does cover most things, except sports.  Any link that opens up a new window (often the websites 'media player'), Chromecast is unable to broadcast.  Frustrating.The technology is very cool, but it has a LONG way to go before it rivals the features/capabilities of devices like AppleTV and game consoles.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kyle Surlow"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I initially held off on buying a chromecast because I didn't understand how it worked and was worried that it would drain my devices' batteries fast. After testing out a friend's chromecast I found that my fears were unfounded and it wasn't an issue.I've had the chromecast for a couple weeks now and have loved it. It handles streaming hd without any troubles and I haven't had any troubles with its wifi. So far I've mostly used it for netflix and plex but have noticed a number of other apps on my device which also support it.
