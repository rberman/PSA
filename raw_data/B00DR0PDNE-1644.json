This is seriously one of those \"how did I live without this?\" devices. I do wish it did more general purpose streaming (like desktop mirroring) but there are work-around apps that I haven't tried. The point is, I haven't tried them because realistically I mostly use netflix and youtube which work perfectly. No more messing with plugging in your laptop, or using the awkward netflix interface from a ps3 or Wii. My phone becomes a remote control and is so stinking convenient.
