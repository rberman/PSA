The Chromecast fits into an HDMI slot on your TV and it gets power via two sources: 1) USB port on your TV or 2) power cord to an electrical outlet. We use the USB powering method and it works perfectly - also reduces \"cord mangle\" in the back of your TV. The down-side includes: 1) it only works with Chrome browser (well, it is Google - so, I guess that is to be expected) and 2) the Chromecast is susceptible to losing its casting signal to the TV. It can take several minutes and attempts to re-establish the connection. On the up-side, when it works (which is most of time) it is very cool. We login to Xfinity and Chromecast archived TV shows and movies for the family to view.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jon Hulen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this.
