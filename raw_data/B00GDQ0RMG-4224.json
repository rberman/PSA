It was so easy to set up and operate. Now I can watch all my favorite shows and movies on my TV. It is user friendly in terms the average person can understand. It is easy to navigate thru the menu and functions.  I love it!  Thinking about getting another one for the bedroom TV.

It appears to be a mistake and I will be returning the Stick as well because it isn't compatible with the Stick either. If Amazon can one day resolve the issue, I would reconsider the Stick because it is useful with having Prime.
