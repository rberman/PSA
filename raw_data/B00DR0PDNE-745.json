Yes, it doesn't have a UI or a remote. But that's its strength. You browse with your phone/tablet/PC, and queue media on the TV. Simple, fast, an easy.This, alongside with YouTube, Netflix and Plex makes it the most useful gadget I've purchased last year!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mart\u00edn Paoloni"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy setup and use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Fried"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to get up and running, small and stays out of sight.

I like it and it was cheap. It essentially enables me to cut cables from my tablet or phone to my TV when I want to stream a movie from something like Plex. It's easy to set up and the interface is fine.  I do like being able to Cast browser pages from my laptop, too. It's nice for projects or vacation planning so that that whole family doesn't have to crown around the laptop to see something. I haven't been able to cast web pages from my phone and I can't cast from my family's Kindles. If those issues were resolved, I'd likely rate this much higher.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brettcw"}]
