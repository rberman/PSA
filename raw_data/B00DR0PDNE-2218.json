In addition to plugging in to an HDMI slot, I also plug it in to AC power via the provided power cord.  My only real beef is that the unit gets VERY warm, even when not being used.

Price: It is the lowest price in the market2. Setup: The setup is extremely easy and it is straightforward3. functionality: When you try to stream a video from Youtube or Netflix, it does not just stream your browser screen, instead there is an app on the device that will connect directly to the service and stream the video. What this enables me to do is to leverage my computer to search (better than any smart tv app) and then turn my computer off once i start the streaming4. Idle state: The chrmoecast will act as a screen saver with very nice nature picture.
