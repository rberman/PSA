The set-up was surprisingly quick and simple. The menu/interface was also easy to navigate through using the supplied remote. While the Amazon Fire TV Stick can be controlled using a mobile app, I love having the remote as an additional option. Also, the specs of this product exceed that of its competitors'. With its dual-core processor and 8GB of storage, I have yet to experience any lag or connectivity issues. One minor con is that I had to connect an Amazon account with a linked credit/debit card before I could download any FREE apps but other than that, this product is amazing. The streaming quality is very clear and I love that I am able to screen mirror my device to the TV. The Amazon Fire TV Stick is a great product that offers awesome app/streaming features without the need of a Smart TV or gaming console.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephanie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it, its phenomenal it does everything play games, tv, movies i don't need cable anymore best purchase I've made.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angela Janisse"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product.

I don't care about the remote and voice command options - it functions just as well as a fire tv.  Paired with Amazon Prime and you can really see the benefit of having a fire tv, or a fire tv stick.  Works well just like the fire tv.  For some, read other people in this house that are techies..., they really like the voice command.  They don't actually use it everyday but they like the option to use it.  Seems like a minor point given the difference in price.  Would be good for a child's room too.  I would use it in every room, but again some may like the voice command and it would be worth it to spend the extra money so I mention that it would be good for a spare room.  We've tested both remotes, and they appear to work with both the stick and the regular fire tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thrifty shopper"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JDW"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I am writing this under my wife's account. I picked it because our Roku failed in less than a year.After about the first two months we had to have it replaced. Less than a few months it is barely working now. I am more than displeased.

It works very well.  I wish more \"free\" movies and games were available, but that have nothing to do with the Fire Stick itself.  A great product, with room for improvement.
