Perhaps I should have read more before purchasing, but was unable to share my screen (with sound) from my MacBook Air. Which means I'm unable to play anything purchased on iTunes or really anything that isn't inside of the Chrome browser. Can't play music from Spotify, iTunes, Etc. The item was described as being a cheaper alternative to the Apple TV, but unfortunately, the ChromeCase does not have near the features the Apple TV does.  The Chromecast is useful if all you want to do is cast YouTube videos to your TV, but beyond that, it does offer much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Andy Krafft"}]
