I haven\u2019t tried that feature out yet, but wanted a streaming stick for when I travel (it\u2019s perfect size for portability).The Fire TV Stick is fast.  Browsing through the menus is a breeze and videos load quickly.  Amazon content is front and center and there is some additional navigation required to pull up an app.As far as content the big names are here; HBO Go, Netflix, Hulu, Watch ESPN, and even Starz/Encore Play.  However Starz/Encore Play is not available for as many cable providers as HBO Go or Watch ESPN.  It\u2019s available for the bigger cable companies, but my smaller, regional cable company (WOW!) is not available on the Starz/Encore Play app.  Slingplayer is an app available for the Fire TV Stick that would be great to use and connect my Slingbox to, but Sling does not support the older Slingbox Solo.  Sling has always been shady about app support and this decision is irksome (a downgrade for Sling, not for Amazon).Compared to Roku (Roku stick available for $10 more) or even Apple, the Fire TV Stick has a long way to go in regards to content.  Most notably for me is FXNow.  As a Simpsons fan the Simpsons World on the FXNow app is incredible and would be a welcome addition to the Fire TV Stick.  Hopefully Amazon works towards adding additional content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tom E G"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Only had it for two weeks but so far I love it.

I unplugged the power cable several times after reading that suggestion in the FAQ area, still with no luck. I finally moved the stick to a new HDMI port and it worked immediately. It's a very cheap and easy way to turn any TV in the house into a smart TV.
