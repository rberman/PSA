[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have been wanting a fire stick for a while now.  I already own an apple TV, and wanted a device that would allow us to access our Amazon Prime services such as the movies, music etc.I bought this when it went on sale on Prime Day and have been in love ever since.  Unlike apple TV, you can personalize this with the ability to download SO MANY APPS!  I'm talking games, tv channels, aquarium, fireplace, etc etc!Parental control - love hate relationship.  I love that I can set one so that my 5 year old doesn't accidentally buy something he shouldn't.  (it's happened in the app store before)  However, having to enter it before every show, movie, game etc that's on prime is a pain.  Honestly, I haven't looked to see if I can modify the settings soooooo....We have had some freezing issues with the stick in leaving games - other than that - it works flawlessly.  I have told (bragged) to everyone about how awesome this stick is.  Truly a great entertainment addition to any house - Amazon Prime members or not.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sarah S."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was the perfect answer for our big screen TV that was not a smart TV.  Worked exactly like it was suppose to, installation was simple.
