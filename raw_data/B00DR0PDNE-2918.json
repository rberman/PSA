I knew that purchasing it, but to make it perfect would be the addition of Amazon Prime.Great things:Able to control YouTube content from my GS4, iPad and Android Tablet.Once connected to your system, it will work seamlesslyI really like how you can add videos to watch on YouTube, so you don't have to wait and play the video.The flexibility to use across many formats.Not so greatI will have to purchase another device to watch Amazon Prime Streaming VideosIt doesn't mirror what is on your device.It doesn't allow you to stream content created by you.It doesn't mirror what is on the Chrome Browser (only the video content) as long as your device supports flash. --Set up - with a receiver - I have a Denon AVR 1912 after about of an hour of frustration and google search, I found out that in order to get audio I had to install Chromecast into the Receiver rather than the TV in order to get sound. I also had to find the HDMI that supported 1.4 and found it to be Game 1 HDMI.  Once it was set up, audio was great. But it was not intuitive(Update: I did get it to work with Chrome Browser. I can view my Google Documents from the player -- I was able to get Amazon Instant Video to stream but the sound doesn't go through the tv and plays from the computer - It's slow and out of sync with what is playing on the TV. You can not get full screen videos.I hope that Amazon reads these comments and adds Amazon Prime Streaming video to -- not only Chromecast but other Android devices... :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ceit \"Ceit\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "We REALLY wanted this to work.
