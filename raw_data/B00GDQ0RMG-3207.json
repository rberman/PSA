As stated by many others setup is easy and simple control buttons are uncomplicated. Movie streaming has been flawless. Only improvement I'd like to see is the watch list. If I could categorize my list it would be easier to find movies in my list. Haven't try music or games. On another note it'easy to switch over my uverse from hdmi 1 to hdmi2 to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "francesro"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great alternative. The Fire Stick is pretty cool, offers a lot of TV shows and movies.  It would be great if it had a larger selection of current movies.. but can't complain for not having a monthly fee. Weird how it syncs with my google account... I wasn't expecting that.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrea F"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "it good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eddie Pressley"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I got this on the $19 deal. Worst purchase I have ever made. Just does not work. I have a strong wifi signal and my wifi works for all other streaming devices in my home. The Fire TV Stick just keeps freezing. I reboot reset and still has same issue. This is just an under powered device. I am glad I only spent $19. No wonder the fire phone was DOA if this the best Amazon can do. I have an Echo on order. If it is as bad as this it will go back.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "brieck"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephanie cisneros"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was genuinely surprised by how responsive this little sucker was.
