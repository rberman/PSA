[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Main reason I like the Apple TV is because I can look at pictures I take on my iphone right on my big screen TV. Can also watch video as well from my iphone. This is only one feature of the Apple TV. It has many more that are so enjoyable. I would recommend everyone who has an iphone and is an itunes memeber to get the Apple TV. You will really enjoy it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "George"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The title \"Wii No More\" is because no longer do I use the Wii for playing YouTube or Netflix videos through my TV. In fact, since getting the Apple TV I haven't even turned on the Wii. The Apple TV is much faster at downloading content for play and rarely pauses during playback. For that alone, I would have given the Apple TV 3 stars. Because there's so much more to love about the Apple TV, I've given it 5 stars.Things I love:1. Airplay Mirroring - if I want people to see something I'm doing on my MacBook, I turn on Airplay Mirroring and just like that, it's on the TV. No more trying to squeeze in to see the MacBook screen or dragging a cable across the room to connect the MacBook to the TV.2. Playing content from a computer - as long as Home Sharing is setup I can pull music and video directly from a computer and play it on my TV. The perfect exercise music is always easily accessible.3. Customizing the Home Screen - with the latest Apple TV update, I can remove the home screen icons that I don't use. With parental controls I was able to remove some of them before, but now I have complete control, minus a few \"required\" icons.4. The Remote App - conducting a search on the Apple TV can be somewhat of a hassle if you are using the Apple Remote that it comes with. Once I started using the Remote App on my iPhone, a keyboard pops up on my phone that I can type the search query in. Down, down, right, right arrow pushing is not required to get to the next letter.5. Size matters - the Apple TV is so small, making it easy to place anywhere. I set it on top of my DVR along with a\u00a0Kinivo 501BN Premium 5 port High speed HDMI switch with IR wireless remote and AC Power adapter - supports 3D, 1080p, which is on a\u00a0OmniMount Tria 1 B - 1 Shelf Wall Furniture (Black/Dark Glass)\u00a0mounted behind/above my TV.6. iTunes integration - renting or purchasing new movies/TV shows from iTunes is so fast and easy. If I have subscribed to a TV show, the show automatically downloads to the Apple TV. And I can also choose to download purchases to my MacBook if I want.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "30/30", "author": "Skip"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Pros:1.

I know quite a few people with the older (hard drive) version who are happy with theirs.Well this the first Apple product that I will be attempting to return. It just flat out is not reliable!! It freezes and continually dumps downloaded material. I have been on numerous  online forums with suggested solutions. Most suggest that network speed is the issue but even after confirming wifi speed to be adequate with my Macbook right beside the unit it doesn't function properly. I rented a movie that was fully downloaded and tried to play it only to be given an error message. This required resetting the unit and re-entering the log in info and downloading the movie again. After failing a few times I finally got it to play. Foolishly I tried to rewind a segment only to have the unit freeze up requiring another reset.I purchased this product primarily to watch movies and You tube my sons nursery rhymes. It is NOT any more convenient than buying Blu-ray! I cannot understand the reason for not offering the hard drive option anymore. They will need to do a lot of bug fixing to get this product to make any sense.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/12", "author": "Docchin75"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I order from Amazon at least on a weekly basis and have never had an issue with a product being defective, thankfully. I already owned an Apple TV, but purchased this one as a gift. Turns out, it didn't work. All I wanted was a replacement, not a refund, and Amazon refused both. Glad I hadn't previously encountered defective products with Amazon because I learned that they will not assist you in getting what you paid for. There went $100 down the drain and I will reorder this product from Apple to give to my relatives who are awaiting their long overdue (working) gift.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "12/26", "author": "bdw9877"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Everything works as they say it would!
