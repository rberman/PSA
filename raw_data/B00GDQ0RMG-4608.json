Still useless. I can connect 3 iPhones, 1 iPod, 3 Kindles, 1 laptop, 1 desktop, 1 Xbox 360 & a Wii but not the FireStick.ORIGINAL: If I could give it a -1, I would. Every day I have to reset this stupid thing to connect to my wifi. No other device in my house has wifi issues. None. It's for my daughters' TV so of course I hear about it every time it stops working. When I do get it to connect, there's always some glitch or issue with streaming. It would be over-priced if it was free.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "HillbillySid"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "just have to star using it more", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marilyn Cardwell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This product streams video and music exceedingly well.
