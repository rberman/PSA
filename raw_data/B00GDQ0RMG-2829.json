Navigation on remote is frustrating\u2022 certain apps, slingtv, need to the stick to restart constantly for the app to work. I am not sure if this is slingTV app issue or a fire stick issue, but the restart does help.I got this through slingTV, and the options were either this stick or the rocky stick. In all honesty, I was leaning towards Roku. I would have gotten the Roku if it wasn't for the device specs showing the fire stick with more processing power, and the fact that I am a prime member.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "@bashar"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am very pleased! Has met and overpasses my expectations. Was very reluctant for a while. Read many reviews and finally decided that the only way to give a fair and just assessment was to try it. I am glad I did. I travel quiet often and this device definitely provides the flexibility to maintain relevance with the programs I gotten accustomed to. I will take with me to the middle east and will post updates on performance shortly. BLUF: If you are the traveler type, this is the item of choice...
