[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Ive had it for two months now and i absolutely  love. It. I really cant think of any complaints. It's so simple my 3 year old son knows how to work the remote to get to what he wants to see or pause it when he needs to use the potty. This is definitely a great buy. I also work at an electronics store that sells these all the way down to the chromecasts, so i know the differences between all the devices that can make a tv smart. And this has to be the best one with amazing quality. I definitely recommend it all the time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mandee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely love in.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Tonya"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It wasn't as easy to set up as described. I kept getting an error message that the HDMI cable wasn't connected even after repeated checks and re-connecting. After purchase, I received an email with the subject line indicating it contained more detailed directions, When I opened the email, it wanted to sell me an instruction book. Also, when I tried to use the unit with the TV, it told me that I had to be an \"Amazon Prime\" member in order to access most of the programs offered. I have recently \"joined\" Amazon Prime on a trial basis and will try again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Professor P \"Professor P\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great little device.  I'm impressed by how easy it was to set up.  I've been watching video content from Netflix and Amazon and I'm really pleased with the quality. I have it hooked up to a projector with a 120\" screen and when it's streaming HD it looks almost as good as a BluRay.  The only con is that you'll need to purchase an HDMI cable in addition to the FireTV as it does not come with one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "James N Ducas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Jest the best,  a drive that you just have to have it work'sThank You Bill Adams", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bill Adams"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "ken c"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!
