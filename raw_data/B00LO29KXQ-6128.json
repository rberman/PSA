[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent! I bought this while it was on promotion for $20...a really good deal. Relatively easy to connect to the TV...just find the HDMI slot and push in. My TV has two HDMI slots and it did not work in slot #2 but it worked in #1. I connected the power source, installed the batteries on the remote and \"it was good to go.\" It was very difficult to remove the battery cover on the remote, but with patience it finally started to move. If this happens to you, be patient! I get Netflix, Amazon, PBS, and others providers too. I'm a Prime member and a lot of the Amazon \"stuff\" is included but not all. I was surprised there were still a few programs that demanded payment. I'm very pleased with the Fire Stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cruztalker"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The unit installed in a snap! The software updates occurred with out a hitch. On my limited bandwidth wireless network, the videos and audios are clear and sharp with no jitter or blatant latency.The selections provided via Amazon Prime are excellent, and the alternative or associated recommendations and offers are appropriate as well. Overall I am a very happy customer! The overall quality and ease of use of this product will make it a winner I am sure", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Timothy Kindle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's small device, packed with a lot of features for a good price and it's easy to setup. It also helps to be a prime member to get access to thousands of streaming movies and shows. In order to enjoy a seamless experience on this device I would make sure you have strong speed connections from your Internet Service Provider. Otherwise, browsing the internet on other devices while using this can be frustrating. I would recommend this to my family & friends.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ahmad"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product! I have a Google Chromecast but my wife always had problems using it because of the requirement of a mobile device like an iPad or phone. So she started using the Xbox, but she doesn't like having to navigate through all the menus to use Netflix. This fire stick is super easy to use and has it's own remote, which is a plus. I would recommend this to anyone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Blake"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i just received it on 11/21/14-i have no complains right now about the device...however Amazon needs to invest in more Apps for instance YouTube is one-Shoprite-Target-and much more", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Birdy31"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This media streaming stick is a tremendous bargain this holiday season.  The only negatives are these - 1) The directional pad on the remote is occasionally too sensitive and over-scrolls left, right, up, and down.  2)  Amazon not-so-subtly pushes their own services rather than presenting content in an even-handed way.  Otherwise, this is a great device - performance is zippy and consistent and the interface (despite my previous complaints) is easy to navigate.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Nathaniel L Burrow"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Home run! of the best product for the year....hope Amazon consider keeping the price low,low,low.

Set up was straight forward and had no issues with connectivity to my wifi.  There was a few minutes of upgrades but after a reboot, the system worked great.  It was fast and streaming was immediate and of great quality.  Excited to get into some of the other apps and streaming services.  If they are anywhere close to as good as the Prime streaming, I am going to keep raving about the Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

Marshall"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The firetv stick at this time does not appear to support home theater receivers. I tried with 3 different Onkyo receivers including my TX NR 1008 and the device will not display a picture. The screen is black with a dark black bar at the bottom that flickers. I was really disappointed, as all other devices work fine with my receivers. I was forced to plug the device straight into my television so I am not receiving any surround sound. If it were not for the fact that this is a brand new device that MIGHT be able to be fixed with a software update I would rate this a 1 star. To the contrary, if this device worked with my receivers I would have given it 5 stars.If you are planning on just using this with a TV then this is by far the best HDMI smart stick on the market. It is very fast, has ever streaming service (except for HBO) and with a little know how, you can side load android APK's.I hope that this is a simple firmware issue that will be resolved in the coming weeks at which point in time, I will edit this review. Same goes for if this issue is NOT resolved.Update: After speaking to 5 different representatives at amazon after posting a question on their forums, they confirmed that the firetv stick DOES NOT WORK WITH HOME THEATER RECEIVERS! I think that it is VERY deceptive for amazon to advertse this product as supporting 7.1 audio when the device cannot be plugged into a receiver.Not to mention that the customer service was TERRIBLE, the first 4 people that I spoke to had no idea what a receiver was or what HDMI was!  I am a huge fan of Amazon but my experience with the firetv stick has been nothing but disappointing.Update: I posted this issue in the Amazon forums before writing this review and just yesterday got some help from Michael James (thank you)!There is a workaround to get the fire tv stick to work on your receiver. I have edited my review to reflect this fix, however, I am knocking them 1 star due to the terrible customer service that told me and others, \"the stick will not work with receivers\". @ Amazon Dev Team, This is still a bug as the device should work with receivers in Auto Mode.I was able to get it to work by changing the Picture Mode setting from Auto to 'Direct'. Before plugging in the Fire TV Stick, change to the input you want to use, then press:Receiver-->Home-->Setup-->Choose Source Setup-->Picture Adjust-->Picture Mode-->Set to Direct (not Auto)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "67/81", "author": "Stephen McGauley"}]
