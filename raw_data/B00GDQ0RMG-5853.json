It wouldn't download the latest update, and won't work until it does. It occurred to me that everyone was probably trying at the same time, so I waited and eventually it downloaded. The auto resolution set automatically set the wrong resolution, but there is a manual adjustment so everything can fit on the screen. Once those issues were solved, we were good to go. I have a Belkin wireless link which does pretty much the same thing, except the Belkin will not show Amazon Instant Videos without reloading every 60 seconds. It works great for Netfilx and everything else. The Fire Stick, on the other hand works perfectly for Amazon Instant Video as well as the others, and for that alone I'm happy with the purchase. The cons are that it won't hook up to my home theater, my install required the HDMI extension, so it's not exactly esthetically pleasing, and on the Samsung it only works on 720. The pros are it works perfectly, picture is great, and at $19 I should have bought 2.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lou"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "it is compact and has done  a good job so far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Keith D Rauch SR"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Blows the Apple TV and the Roku and the Chromecast out of the water. For $0.99, you can download an AirPlay app from the Amazon store which allows you to AirPlay from your iPhone/iPad/Mac directly to your Amazon Fire TV Stick. It works flawlessly. That, combined with Plex, Twitch, YouTube, and Netflix and I have everything I need (and Amazon Prime Instant Streaming, of course).To be fair, there are two slight flaws. 1) the YouTube app is really laggy for some reason. I expect more from Google. 2) it's not quite as responsive as \"full-sized\" TV boxes, like the AppleTV or the bigger Amazon Fire TV box (non-stick). But it plays videos flawlessly \u2014 which is what it's designed to do \u2013 and for less than half the price of its competitors, it's hard to argue with.Oh, also, it's got games, although I'm not a heavy gamer, but they look fun and run well for the few I've tried.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Philip B. \"Philip\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I bought this stick under the $19 offer for prime members and I was hugely optimistic.I'm a huge purchaser of nearly every new electronic device that comes out so I figured I'd take the plunge on this. There is a huge lack of Amazon store related content. What you see advertised on the product listing is literally just about all there is available. The GUI is snappy and clear, but initially the streaming was horrendous. I had the stick set to 1080p 60hz hooked up to my 240hz LED tv and the picture would come through blurry, slightly distorted on whatever I play (flixster, prime content). I couldn't get a single device I own to miracast to it (iPad, HTC one, galaxy s4). Upon unplugging it after getting immensely frustrated, I also noticed the thing to be quite warm.Since it wouldn't work well on the tv I wanted to use it on, I set it up on a 720p Toshiba and adjusted the settings to 720p. I sidelpaded XBMC and began playing a bunch of content on that. After about a week of use, my sluggish stick seemed to pick up juice. So, I plugged it back into my tv that I wanted to use it on (1080p 240hz LG LED) and low and behold the thing works fine now. Don't know why it would take a week to shake off the dust, but it's up and operational. No WiFi issues as most are reporting. I use an Apple airport extreme (get yourselves a good WiFi hotspot people, yes the Apple ones are pricy, but the quality and performance outmatch netgear, linksys, and others) with no issues whatsoever.I still rank this at 4/5 stars due to lack of initial content. The fire tv box has much more for some reason. My hope is that there is a firmware update to improve the app store content and ability to customize the home screen a bit.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Jason A."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Loosing internet connection often, have to reboot the device to get it back.

I bought 2 of these sticks (one for a gift) when they were on first on sale for $20.  What a deal!!!  Even at $40 it's only $5 more than the competition's stick... and I'm pretty sure this one is much better.So far all I've used it for is NetFlix and Amazon Prime video.  I do intend to use it for some other stuff too... mostly music streaming.  Unfortunately, my music service of choice, Slacker, isn't available.  Hopefully it will be soon.  No intention of doing any gaming but I might check it out if I get bored.Let's break it down:Pros:Inexpensive and totally worth it even at $40Great quality in NetFlix and Amazon videoResponsive remote.  RF so it works without line of sight.  Good size.  Easy to use without looking.All necessary hardware included.Pretty nice packaging.  Not a blister pack.No hiccups or stuttering playing videoCons:You should probably use the included power adapter instead of trying to use a USB output on the TVFire stick was pre-setup with my account.  This is a problem because I plan on giving one as a gift.An update was immediately required.  This took about 10-15 minutes.No power button.  You have to navigate to the settings menu to put in sleep mode.Limited apps but most of what you expectNo wired network support (but you already knew that)The first time it starts up it asks you to connect to your wireless network, then it starts updating.  You cannot stop or skip.After the update completes, you may be re-requested to setup your wireless network, but by the time I noticed and got the remote, it managed to remember the settings.  Then you will have to adjust the overscan (which is set to no overscan by default, which is what you expect on HDMI).  Next the first time tutorial video starts.  This goes over the basics of how to use the device.  After that, you're off to the races.Using NetFlix for the first time requires downloading the app.  No big deal but it's not built in.  It looks like I can also move video from my phone to the Amazon Fire TV Stick and use it for streaming with my iPhone.  I haven't tested this feature yet.All I was looking for was a basic and easy to use way to watch Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix on my TV.  This thing delivers absolutely perfectly.  I'll try to update this review again later after using more of the capabilities and features.  If it doesn't do anything more than it does now, I think it is more than adequate, and only the addition of Slacker would make the product complete for my purposes.I don't know why you haven't bought one of these yet.
