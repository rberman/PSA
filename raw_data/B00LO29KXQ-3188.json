[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Didn't work on my tv in my bedroom.  It wouldn't stay connected.  However, it worked as expected on my Samsung in the basement.  I purchased it for use in the basement so I'm not too bent out of shape about it.  Not sure why I'm having connection problems in the bedroom that's only 5-6 yards from the router.  Haven't experienced a disconnection yet on the one in the basement.  It's location is just about directly underneath the router.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dindsol"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to set up and use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

Get to watch all my favorite stuff and can stream Amazon in HD. Easy to navigate.

I'm on my second remote and I'm done. Remote is of the lowest quality and stops working at any given time. It is so sensitive that if you lightly drop it on your sofa to use your tv remote just by hitting the sofa surface it will switch functions.

I have all the major brands and find each is a little different, none perfect, none horrible.  It is an adjunct to cable tv, not a replacement.  You get the networks they have arrangements with, not necessarily the ones you want.  A nice addition.  Remember, much of the content is pay to watch, so you will end up spending more than you anticipated until the novelty wears off.
