My Amazon Fire TV stick was super easy to assemble that within 2 1/2 mins of setting it up (including watching the informative guide),  I was enjoying HD quality TV.  I can truly say,  the picture quality is as good or better then cable TV!  And I didn't even have to get stuck paying a high monthly cable bill or a lengthy contact!  I am ALL smiles,  thank you  Amazon for such a wonderful site!
