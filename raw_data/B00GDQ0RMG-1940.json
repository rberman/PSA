I love the interface, it is speedy, loads videos quickly, does not lag, looks great, and is simple to use and set up. I also like the remote. For $39 I recommend this device and you definitely cannot go wrong.However; there are some drawbacks (which is to be expected somewhat considering the cost of this device).I wanted to be able to use this play movies off of my network drive/DLNA server (Synology NAS) but unfortunately this device does NOT support it out of the box. You can only access media off of the internet. In my opinion, this makes the device limited, which is why I only gave it three stars instead of five.Secondly, the apps. While there are many decent apps available, many of them are NOT free (just another way for Amazon to get more money from you).Third, system is locked down by default, meaning you can only install Amazon Apps. This also makes the device limited. If you want to install Android Apps you must sideload them (which is what I did). Side-loading Android apps on to this device makes it so much better and adds more functionality! In fact I was able to load an App for free (Kodi) which was not available in the Amazon App store that allowed me to stream media from my Synology.It might be nice if this had an SD card slot for additional memory. The built in memory is only around 5.5 GB and if you load a lot of apps and games onto the device you might run out of room; However, with a device at this price point it is understandable as an SD card slot would add cost to the device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Aviator"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "So the question is does it have to a Internet or WiFi connection", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/6", "author": "John Menzie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic!

Surround sound works but it drops wifi connection and requires a power cycle to work correctly again about once a week. I contacted support and they suggested a reset to factory defaults. This did not resolve the problem. No other wifi connected devices (phones, tablets, laptops) have any issues with my wireless router.The interface is user friendly and the phone app is even better for controls but who wants to root around behind their entertainment center once a week?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bakes"}]
