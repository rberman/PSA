I have used it for several months now and sadly must give it a 1 star rating.  I have experienced the same terrible connection issues when streaming a tv show or movie. There are 15, 523 total reviews, and a total of 2300 1 and two star ratings, with the majority citing bad connectivity.  That's about 14.5 %. or the sake of this discussion, take out the comments that don't address connectivity issues, and you still have over 10% with connectivity problems.Common Amazon, 1 out of every 10 units sold is broken?  Is that what you built your reputation on; supplying faulty merchandise?  Amazon, you need to man up and fix a fix and download to all units, or if it's hardware, resend everyone who wants an upgraded unit for free.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "barharborboy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great watching movies on \"demand\" !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Monica L.

I do have Highspeed Cable, and this little Fire TV Stick works very well, no lag, no errors so far.  I've actually got this early December but just now got around to installing it. I've got 2 Roku's as well.I've watched several shows, movies on Prime plus listened to Prime Music, which was the big surprise!  Also, you can view your online photos you've uploaded to your Prime Cloud account, another bonus! As far as available APP's, I'm not too worried about the Stick's current limitations, in all honesty, I only watch Amazon Prime, Netflix, VUDU and once in a while Crackle, the disappointment would be the lack of VUDU, I can't understand why this is so, but I can get it on 2 other TV's, so not a deal breaker. My favorite thing, the interface is so much better than either of my Roku's, makes everything look even better and crisper.  I've successfully watched shows and movies on Crackle and Netflix.At the price I got this and performance so far, I could not be any happier!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "theunartist"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome little device.

I put on Crackle and other sites, cant even watch a show, it stops and gets blurred, this is not worth it.
