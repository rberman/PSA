[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love the chromecast. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because whenever I cast from my iphone it freezes. When I cast from my computer it's fine but I can't get it to work with my phone yet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "steve mann"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I am a cinephile nut with a pair of Roku's, a Boxee box, Samsung internet access on my blu-ray player, and a great 7.1 Onkyo receiver (that I only have 5.1 on so far) with a HD33 1080 projector from Optoma.  I added this Chromecast to an extra port on my receiver and it's easy to access and throw things at it from Youtube, Netflix and a few other offerings.  I am wondering if having my HDMI port where I have it installed is perhaps not the best place as I do seem to get some choppiness in my video streaming, where I don't via any of the other internet wired or wireless ways I have to play from.  Will have to play with that, if moving it out front changes anything.  The fact that my receiver has a HDMI port in the front will allow me to play with that and also make the device more portable for me as well since I am thinking it will be of benefit for my use of broadcasting from my laptop or cell phone at a friends TV.  The chromecast app works well on my LG Android phone, and the Chrome extension on my laptop works well also.I only wish I could do more with it.  To be able to play video files direct from my laptop, and not have to run them through a browser, would be a great feature.  Also, the requirement to have to power it via a USB port seems cumbersome.  Is there no power capability through HDMI itself?  Perhaps not.  Anyway, would like to do a lot more with it, so keep it's support coming and bring on the additional apps!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer \"William\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Have tried with laptop and Surface.

The Chromecast seemed like a goot solution at the right price.The TV handgs on the wall, so I used the included extention to connect it to the back of the TV so that the dongle does not stick out and does not hit the wall.  I plugged the Chromecast into the outlet, and did the setup on my Android tablet.  From opening the box to using it tool me less than 10 minutes.  I tried Netflix and Youtube and both work great.  However, casting a streaming video from a Chrome browser from a netbook did not work well at all.  The video was choppy and the sound was out of sync with the video.Overall, I have achieved my goal of being able to watch Netflix on this TV, and the price was reasonable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Don Iguano \"SPB-RU\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Does what is says on the box.
