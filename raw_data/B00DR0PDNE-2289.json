One thing to be aware of is it needs and external power source (USB or standard outlet plug). This was the one drawback I saw but not much way around that one since HDMI doesn't carry power. Netflix works as well as if you were streaming on a Laptop, may even a little better. Picture comes in very nicely. HBOGO is laggy at times. New apps coming out for this will definitely make it even more versatile. Plugged into a smart TV, works better than the smart TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephen Ioannou"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "my second one.  probably geting another for my study room,  to have access to all of my documents in every room.  works with my phone seamlessly", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hannah"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've been using this thing almost non-stop since I got it.

The execution, however, leaves a bit to be desired. 1) It's buggy: It overrides the application inside the application and makes for some difficult navigation. Sometimes the application crashes during use and the stream cannot be controlled at all. 2) It's limited: Google makes it fairly obvious they want it to work with whatever application they think it should work. This means pay apps which Google either owns or is possibly getting a cut of the profits. I wish it were a little more \"rogue\" and it was up to the user as to what he/she wanted to stream. There are ways around it on a computer, but not your mobile device which would be more useful. All in all, it's fine and if you're already a Netflix subscriber, this comes in handy for a low price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Blaine Henry \"Loko Hank\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The product is very good.
