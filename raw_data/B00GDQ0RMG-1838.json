I got rid of Dish after they raised my bill ridiculously and really looked forward to getting my Fire TV Stick with Sling TV programming!!! When I received it, I was really jazzed with all their great features, as advertised!! The installation process is super fast and super easy, especially if you already have an account with Amazon!! Super cool, I must add!!! I was up and running in several short minutes. The picture clarity is superb!!! The audio is also first-class!!!I resisted joining Amazon Prime, because I already had accounts with Sling TV and Hulu Plus. And...they seemed to work quite well with my Wi-Fi wireless network system!! However, after seeing all that Amazon Prime has to offer...so much out there!!...I joined up. =====Now here is the reason I have given this review three stars.===== Amazon does most all of their programming with \"streaming\" and it is TOTALLY AGGRAVATING!!!!!! With all of the amount of memory storage capacity it maintains, they still \"stream\" EVERYTHING!!! They also state, that I don't have enough bandwidth with my high speed internet to handle their streaming, so my viewing will be constantly starting and stopping while viewing my TV program and movie selections!!!! One of their strongest arguments to having you purchase this equipment, is that your viewing selections would be seen immediately!!! Even if the loading process took a minute or two, I could be very happy with that!! At least, I would be watching my selections seamlessly!!!What gets me the most, is that you can only watch ONE PROGRAM AT A TIME or LISTEN TO ONE RADIO STATION AT A TIME, so why is it so hard to \"load\" that TV selection, movie, or other programming selection \"into available memory\" for seamless viewing pleasure?????!!!!! It is not rocket science, and the Fire TV Stick already has the technology built-in!! I have tried everything imaginable to make the Stick work as well as the Sling TV and Hulu Plus programming, but to no avail. I will do my best for a while longer, but may have to return the \"Stick\" after all.

Unfortunately this thing has an awful wifi connection. Even with my access point 12 feet away it will only stay connected for a few minutes. In the odd times it does work, it will constantly stop whatever I am watching to buffer. I understand it can be fixed with a firmware update......so do it.I would not recommend buying this unless they fix the issue.
