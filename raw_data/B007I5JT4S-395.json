I bought a second one for the bedroom cause I love the first so much! I am an iPhone and iPad user so this is perfect for steaming music and movies to. You can also mirror the images from your screen onto the Apple TV. This was worth buying alone just for Netflix!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Annette M.

Make sure you pick up an Amazon HDMI cord, and you'll be good to go. I can operate the Apple TV with my iPhone and iPad, it plays music from my iTunes match account, the Netflix and HBOgo apps work perfectly with 1080 picture and Dolby 5.1 sound...it is simply an excellent device.

Martin"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Our family replaced our costly basic cable subscription with two new Apple TVs.  We use the Apple TV to watch Netflix and Hulu's paid streaming services which are far less expensive than basic cable.  We also love accessing our iTunes Music and Movie libraries from our Mac computers wirelessly on the Apple TV as well as directly from the iTunes Store.  I especially enjoy using the Apple Remote app on my iPhone as the remote control for our Apple TVs rather than the remote control unit included with the Apple TV.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 Stars is because we would like to continue to see more content providers, especially no cost content providers, added to the already growing list of content available on the Apple TV.  Most recently, I was happy to see PBS was added as a no cost content provider on the Apple TV.  Netflix and Hulu have plenty of children's programs, so our kids enjoy the Apple TV as much as my wife and I.  It's much more than a TV, like the iPhone is much more than a phone.  Although I personally don't watch too many movies or TV shows, personally, my greatest enjoyment of the Apple TV is streaming music, photos, and home videos straight from my iPhone right onto the Apple TV!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "petergar \"petergar\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Typical apple product -- simple, easy to set-up, impressive. I just wish it had a direct icon for Amazon Prime, like what is displayed for HuluPlus, Netflix, etc.Easy to use. The Apple Radio and Internet stations for music are a great feature as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
