I like that I can bring it either television in my home. It pauses then starts back up even after being unplugged.

The video is much higher quality on the Amazon stick.  The remote is a little difficult to get used to, but otherwise this is a perfect product.  It basically turns your TV into a smart tv.  It is especially great for families like mine that do not subscribe to cable, but instead use streaming video services.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KatieDC"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product.

I haven't had any issues with it so far. I did struggle to open the remote backing but got through it! Ha. The only thing is I wish you can add other TV viewing apps like NBC or ABC so I can catch up on shows that way! But we have a Netflix account and everything was so simple to connect to. I have a Wii and connecting to Netflix is a 30 minute process and even longer when the wireless connection is \"weak.\" But with the stick it surprised me how easy it was! And I love how easy it is to go from one TV to the next. Great job Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Allison"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "\ud83d\udc4d", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nitin"}]
