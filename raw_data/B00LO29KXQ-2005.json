I have several of these devices. They ALL have issues with keeping a WiFi signal.  They will work for a little while (time varies) and then will start to hiccup and finally just stop receiving signals.  Then, after a restart they'll start working for a (shorter) while again.  Unplugging them and plugging them back in helps too. I've tried two routers now and both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz frequencies and several channels.  Same thing. I am not the only person having this problem.  As of this review there are multiple post in the forums about this problem (one is 34 pages and growing).  I love Amazon (and buy way too much from them :), but apparently there is too much interference in my house and these aren't of much use to me.
