[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Was extremely easy to setup and I can do everything wire-lessly now. Great replacement for all the hdmi cords that I used to have behind the TV. I can move this around from TV to TV and use it all over my house and I can use it on every device. Only caveat for tablets and smartphone devices is that you can't stream things that are on the web it can only stream things from Apps. So I can't stream Hulu.com or any website on the Web App from my tablet or smart phone. You can only stream Apps and there are a list of Apps on the ChromeCast App that is downloaded to the device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Casey L"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "excelent", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "JORGE MUNOZ PACHECO"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Dan"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I was very excited to receive my Chromecast stick, but was soon disappointed to discover it only works with a limited number of phones.
