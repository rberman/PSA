So I'll stick to a pro's and con's list just to highlight my own personal thoughts.But first, the one thing I do want to single out though, is the ability of this device to use compatible apps you may already have in your collection, items I haven't even seen them list as compatible in the searches. While setting up the stick, I noticed two of my surveillance apps at the top of the screen. Set up and tested both with no issues. For me this is a huge plus, since this will mostly be a device I use while traveling.Pros:-Compact for travel-Quick and responsive-Lots of apps-Ability to watch my surveillance cameras on a big screen if I so desire.-Slick, compact remote (even if it isn't voice compatible)Cons:-Remote issues (could be a line of sight thing, but clicking once might result in multiple responses overshooting selections you  intended to make. VERY frustrating trying to select text or anything else)-Apps (there are still a few apps that are not supported yet, either not available or service providers not authorizing use, but with  Amazons pull I'm sure that is only momentary)Feel free to ask me any questions. If I don't know I'll test it and find out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tommy M."}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Do you need the internet to use this", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/9", "author": "jeremy a miller"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV stick is great.  I purchased mainly for Netflix but it does so much more.  Great price, great product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "PamS"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I didn't expect very much when I purchased this item for a dumb tv in my library.  While it's great having access to my Netflix and Prime accounts, I was delighted to find there are a number of both free and for cost apps designed specifically for the Fire Stick.  In particular I quickly found an app that enabled me to directly access and playback music, pictures and video stored on my various NAS servers.  Costing a whopping $1.50, the app is incredibly easy to use and unlike other products so far has never exhibited any out of sync or stuttering on my network -- even with demanding HD material.The Fire Stick menu interface itself is very easy to navigate and offers a great deal of flexibility in terms of setup for various screen sizes.  An important consideration in my case.  I found the supplied remote very easy to use.  I was able to pick up the Fire Stick on sale for $24.95 at a local merchandiser and consider it to be the bargain of the year.  Highly recommended.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "H.

I was eager to set it up because I love my Fire TV box that I have set up in my living room. Unfortunately the stick is extremely sluggish. The remote is not as responsive as the Fire TV remote, or even the Apple TV Remote. Also, it continues to scroll through selections even after I have stopped scrolling. The video seems to struggle to hit 1080p on hulu plus, constantly downgrades to SD. I've also experienced complete video freezing/drop off. I wish that it worked, but for $19 I'll keep trying and then just count it as a loss.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/6", "author": "Chris"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love this product.
