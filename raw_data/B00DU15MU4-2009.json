I have had more issues with it since I bought it about 6 months ago.  My NetGear box works far more reliably on the other TV.  It constantly locks up so I have to go in and reset all the passwords for NetFlix and my Amazon account.  It constantly tells me that \"this title is currently not available, try again later or select another title\", then another title doesn't work.

The firebox is definitely faster than my smart tv. It starts up faster, and even loads movies twice as fast.
