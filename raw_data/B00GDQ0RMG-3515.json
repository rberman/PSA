After 2 months it started to have issues. Cannot watch a show or movies without it dropping video and all you hear is audio until supposedly wi-fi connection catches up. Signal strength on wifi is strong and connected, but connected with problems. Can't go a day without resetting router, resetting fire stick and clearing data and cache, and that solves the problem for 5 minutes. Save your money. This is garbage! Spend your extra money on Roku stick! There is no substitute! Amazon Fire stick is useless right now in my house.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James Castro \"Stro1477\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent way to be entertained  without paying for it...
