Streaming to the device from just about any phone, computer, or tablet is a breeze and managing the device is easy as well. I don't know what I did without it! Chromecast can double as dongle to give your tablet or laptop a mirrored monitor which is great for working in a small group when you want to display a document on scree. Highly recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ashleigh fullerton"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "waste of money! far too difficult to set up & even then it has very limited functions.

Glad all of these are with manufacturers warranty from Google and Amazon got them in 1 day. There is tons of Chinese fakes out there that try to emulate these nice Media Streamers.
