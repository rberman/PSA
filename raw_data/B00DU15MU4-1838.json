Like in the store, please don't label \"Try For Free\" games as just Free. They hidden that fact some were in the description of the product instead of just being up front about it. Also make it were you can canceled a download, because if you download something by mistake then you have to wait for it to finish before deleting it. That means you have to let it slow down your internet until its finished. Kinda frustrating to say the least. The UI could use a complete overhaul in my personal opinion, but to each their own. Other then that they could optimize the voice function better, like let you use in apps. For example in YouTube let me voice search for videos instead of painfully typing each word out on the remote. Plus the app market is more the lacking in quality apps, the entertainment apps are fine but everything else is lacking highly in quality and quantity as well. Kinda sad to be honest. A lot of simple quality of life improvements would make this the best steaming/media device to buy on the market for the price range.
