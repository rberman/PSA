[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I bought during Black Friday and It has met my expectations with the cost of $25.  I have been having trouble with the remote so I have been forced to use the app from the phone.  I didn't renew my subscription to Prime because of the prince increase and the lack of content...I was happy to see the videos I purchased were still in my library. I plan on buying the Chromecast to compare.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "narose \"nar9311\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Picked this up on the $20 Prime member special when it was first announced. Great for the price. Like the Roku 2 & 3 more - primarily better interface and search. This is nice for the size and portability. I have no experience with the similar Google Chromecast or Roku sticks so can't do an apples to apples comparison with those.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Doug"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really like this compared to my Roku and Samsung smart TV. It is much more responsive when you change of look for apps. My favorite is the selection of nature, fireplace, and snowfall apps. They are better than the Blu-rays I have. Also if you use the radio app, instead of displaying the radio station logo it does a slide show of beautiful pictures. I am hoping  to see more and more apps such as Drama Fever. For a tiny stick that plugs into your HDMI port, this thing rocks.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lance"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install and use.

So far so good. I do wish the power plug was on the end like the roku stick, but it works. Also, noticeably faster to startup compared to the roku stick. I gave that one up for this and it seems like a good trade. I'm just waiting for HBO2GO on this and I'll be set.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "haruman \"haruman\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire stick was easy enough to set up. It took several attempts to connect to my wifi. You will definitely want to use the ac power cord or the Fire stick will fire up each time you turn the tv on.
