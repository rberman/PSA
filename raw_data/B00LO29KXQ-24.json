Wish Amazon had a larger movie selection but the Prime Original Series are proving to be good so far. Also HBO and others jumped on board and it makes it really nice to watch. I like to use this device alot. It is super easy and quick to pick up...auto shutoff makes it nice at bed time, turns back on instantly after pressing any key. It relocates easily and never loses memory that I can tell. I move it room to room often it is so easy no need for multiples. What can I say?
