I was not going to buy a new TV, so a friend of mine gave me a Google Chrome \"chromecast\" as a surprise for Christmas.  I subscribe to Amazon Prime and cannot connect with it via  Chromecast.  Wish he would have know that (didn't ask).  So I purchased a Fire TV Stick.  Another reason I got the TV stick is that I travel and like to watch movies that may not be on the hotel or resorts' TVs.  I recently took it with us on a 2 week trip to Hawaii.  One week we rented a private house, which had WIFI and it worked perfectly.  I was able to connect with Amazon Prime and Netflix with absolutely no problem.  Setup was simple.  We then stayed at a time share and again, no problem and easy setup.  Now when I am at home I use it all the time.  I can even take it from a tv in one room and use it on a tv in another room.  I don't even use the Chromecast anymore.I would highly recommend this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike Z"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy to use out of box.
