Its not 100%, but the voice search takes you only to amazon content.  That's pretty frustrating.  Least worst option, and I'm not saying it is, is still 1 star.  It might have been 2 stars, but that crazy animated demo was pretty terrible.  I would imagine this is slightly better than apple tv, but I want search to find the best option to watch something.  For example, \"Orange is the new black\" took me to amazon, not Netflix.  From what I understand, there's no way to watch content from my local file server, and no Google content.
