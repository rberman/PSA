[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I Like It!It's so simple to setup and use.I tried a Chromecast first and it was always a hassle. It either couldn't be found or it was slow to respond.And using my phone as the remote sucks for me. Every app has it's own thing.I like that this stick has a remote and it's own interface.It's much easier to navigate around and find the things I want to watch and have play/pause ff/rw buttons.And now that it can be used in hotels and other places you need to login to, it's the only choice.There is even an app that lets me view my office webcams so I can check out what's going on from my TV at home!I haven't used it to play games yet, I'm not a video gamer so that is not a big feature for me, but it's cool to know it's there.Only thing missing for me right now is WatchABC.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to install and use......glad I made this purchase", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sue Matherne"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "easy set up. simple to use. really is plug and play. would recommend to others.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anthony"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice streaming device", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marissa Juan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I use it primarily to view Netflix.

So I am limiting it to use it for Netflix and other stream services that doesn't have so ridiculous constrains.(2) Plex that is the app to stream local media that comes with the stick but is not that free as advertized.  You have to activate it paying extra 6 USD to activate it (If not you will get a 1 min playback) AND the worst thing is that it has bugs (constant requirement to re-activate your client until you remove and re-install the application again) plus the fact if your server doesn't support trans coding like mine (small NAS) then the Player is unable to play common formats like AVI or MKV.  Using the windows version of the Plex Home Theater doesn't have those issues and open these files.The only good thing for me was that I could side loaded KODI (formerly known as XBMC) that is FREE and opens any video in any format using any type of server.  But this is not part of the base experience of the device so I had to mess on Internet forums to overcome some these annoying issues.For now if I want to see Amazon Prime Instant Video I have to pay also for a VPN provider and do a VPN to get an US IP Address to circumvent the constrain but this adds costs just to have an stream line experience.I know that the intend of the stick is to access Amazon content and all the focus is there but for me is a very limited experience and it's a shame.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kirk Steinklauber"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I keep loosing wifi connection, then have to manually unplug and plug back in to reset.
