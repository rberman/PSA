Since all we want is Amazon Instant and Netflix, I thought maybe this device could help ... it did! This little stick is *fast* and the UI is better (clearer, faster), and it seldom has any problems ... now the big TV is just a monitor, and it works well. The remote control is simple enough to live with, too. All in all, the best video investment we've ever made.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good for newbies to streaming but not anything like the box in performance.
