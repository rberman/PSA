However multiple apps may not support music play over. Roku doesn't have this sweet feature.The stick does lack channels and possible features if comparable to the Roku Stick, but that may not be much of a turn down. Major items such as hulu and Netflix are available. No worries there. If you're looking to watch/view items from your DLNA or media server, there is a free option (plex), but I would prefer buying the $2 ViMu app. It plainly performs better and  has less hassle.As I've seen from other reviews, the stick burns out. I'll see if I encounter the problem. As of now, its great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Malachi Aguirre"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ricardo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Travis Stith"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Amazon stick...works well with my television...I can watch hulu, netflix, and Amazon tv without problems...for $30 you get a lot for your money...I definitely recommend...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "nitabk1"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kenneth velasco"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!
