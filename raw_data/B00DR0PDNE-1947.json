Firmly believe that the device's full potential has yet to be met. For now, though, it is a great device to use for watching Netflix (and other video) and listening to music on your TV. Even nicer if you've an older TV that has no built in apps; instant upgrade for 35 bucks! :-)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

The first one is on our living room near the router.  From what I've read, I tend to agree that performance increases when it's located close to the router.  The one in my bedroom (which isn't too far from the router but still further than the one in the living room) doesn't stream as well; the picture can be a bit choppy.  The one in the living room works great.  Since we have a Roku, we mainly use the Chromecast for Youtube, TheDareWall, stuff like that.  Shows from thedarewall stream seamlessly but movies tend to get a bit choppy.  Not sure why that is.  But at this price, to be able to stream things to your TV instead of watching them on a laptop is definitely worth it.

We've tried everything and I must say, the Chromecast provides the best user experience. True, not every app can Chromecast (yet), but just use a Chrome Browser Tab from your desktop or laptop to get what you want on your big screen. I can see myself ordering two more (one for the bedroom and one for the Man Cave). I can buy 3 of these for the price of one Apple TV or Roku 3.
