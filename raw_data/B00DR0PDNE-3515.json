[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I was an early adopter of Chromecast and everything was all good when you could watch Amazon Instant Video streamed from my laptop. THEN they decided to block all access by changing their media player to Silverlight. Now all of a sudden Chromecast doesn't support Silverlight!!!! That's not cool Amazon!!! First you won't release a Instant Video app for Android, only for your crappy Kindle Fire and now you pull this! Bezos needs to go run Washington Post and sell Amazon to a nicer person. Amazon is trying to control what we pay for just so they don't lose a little money form people not buying his crappy tablet. I love Chromecast and everyone should have one. I just wish Amazon cared more.Thanks for nothing Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "James Friedman"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Cool idea..but it doesn't do anything different. I mean there are multiple products out there that people already have that do the same thing. Your PlayStation Xbox smart TV.. all do the same thing and its right there. You don't have to sync anything or use WiFi. Like I said cool idea but until I can stream my phone activity (web browsing, game play, apps) its going in the junk drawer", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/5", "author": "robert gordanier"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really like it.

Lea"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I have had the chromecast for about 2 weeks now and although I was very enthusiastic about the idea, I have not been having a great experience with the product so far.  It seems like the only services that work well-ish are Netflix and YouTube (Although, I have been having trouble with Netflix when trying to cast from my mac but works fine on my tablet and iPhone.)  If you want to play local content from your computer, you have to deal with all sorts or home brew solutions(some work better than others but none are perfect) or cast your entire desktop and then you have a reduced frame rate which is noticeable and mildly distracting.  Also, if you cast your entire desktop to play local content, the audio comes out through your computer instead of your tv speakers and there is not much support out there to figure out how to make it work.The product itself is solid but the software and firmware are half baked at best and have caused hours of research to try to make it work the way I wanted it to.  Chromecast is about as far away from Apple's motto of \"It just works\" as you could possibly get.  It works but you gotta figure it out yourself to get some good use out of it and so far it has been a pain to deal with.  It has potential though, once some decent firmware/software comes out or people come out with plugins and stuff that let you play local content without issues.  I am pretty disappointed in Google for releasing this products with so many unresolved kinks.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "25/31", "author": "Bartosz Jaworski"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This really is a very useful device and it's nice to watch Netflix and YouTube on the big screen with no problems.

Setup was very easy, simply plus it into the HDMI port and in my case I used a USB port for power.  When I tried to configure it from my PC it failed the first time, but I told it to try again without changing anything and it worked no problem at all.  Trying out the supported apps worked great, but the reason I bought it was to stream Amazon Prime movies to a TV that doesn't have an Internet or WiFi connection.  Unfortunately this is where the bad news starts.  While I can Cast from a Chrome browser in general, Amazon Prime uses Silverlight which appears is not supported yet.  When I cast the tab I see everything on the tab except the video itself.  Hopefully Amazon will support casting directly, both to simply allow me to watch Amazon Movies on the ChromeCast but also because direct support will perform better than streaming through the PC.Edit...Great advice from a reply to my original post.  Uninstalling Silverlight from the PC forces Amazon Prime to use Flash and that will Cast to the TV.  Still looking forward to native ChromeCast support for better resolution and performance.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "111/142", "author": "MetaTony"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Finally received the Chromecast yesterday after a lengthy wait.  Installation could not have been easier - I used a Nexus 7 tablet and the process took about 3 minutes.

The only downside of it is that there are not too many apps that work with it although youtube and netflix will make it worthwhile for most people.  Due to the lack of apps, I dropped it 1 star.
