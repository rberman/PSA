I also wanted to be able to access PBS so I tried using the web browser on my smart TV. This did not work well at all. Then bring in the Fire TV stick. This thing is plug and play (except mine was in German but Amazon tech support provided Amazon's usual outstanding service). It is so much faster than my TV interface and very intuitive.  You can access all the usual suspects (Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, etc) but for my son, PBS was all he cared about. There are lots of apps to chose from (some requiring either paid subscription (Netflix, Hulu, etc), account set up (Pandora) or cable TV (Disney, ABC, etc). For Prime members, you can access all the free movies and TV series. You can also use it on other TVs or during travel.
