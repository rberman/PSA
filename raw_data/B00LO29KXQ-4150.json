I have a cable channel selector and the one that came with the stick doesn't work with the other one. I can't get anything to come up when I hit options. I see that Netflex is there and a few other ones but it is not letting me access them. Not really happy with the stick. I am not mechanically gifted so I wish there were more instructions with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "boston"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "What a great product this is, easy as pie to install and operate.
