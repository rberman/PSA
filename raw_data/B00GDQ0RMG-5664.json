I got Fire TV stick for $20 when it is available for preorder. It is a clear winner among these two. I can install any third party application on the device, you can't do that on the chromecast. I have to admit that the streaming is very good and hardly see the buffering issues that I notice with chromecast. A real remote is another added benefit. If I were to choose chromecast or Fire TV I'll pick Fire TV in a heartbeat.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Balaji Balasubramaniam \"Balaji\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Same complaint as others.  Drops wifi signal for no good reason when all my other devices work fine.  Back to my wii for streaming movies etc I suppose.  Have the same problem with prime movies as well though so this may not be a device so much as an Amazon problem.  Sure to lose the crazy small remote all to often as well!!

But it seems to drop the network connection quite frequently, and the only way to fix it is to power cycle the Stick by unplugging it and plugging it back in. This minor issue can be quite annoying, and happens nearly every day.Because of this, I can't say I recommend it, but I also won't say I don't recommend it, as when it works, it works well.
