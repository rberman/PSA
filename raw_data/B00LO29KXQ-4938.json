[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received this for Christmas and it has been fantastic!  Our daughter can watch all of her movies on the big screen now and she is thrilled!  We took it on vacation and were able to her up with Sesame Street and Daniel Tiger when she needed some down time.  If you have a prime account, I am not sure why you wouldn't own a Fire Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BLL1015"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy install and setup. I haven't explored many of the apps yet but this is a pretty cool device. I like how it easy links to my Prime account. It doesn't have a lot of the same apps as Apple TV which is good as I was originally just trying to supplement Apple TV and view the Amazon instant video and Amazon original series as well. Now I have lots of other stuff to check out as well. And I can play Tetris.

If you're used to streaming devices it's slightly easier.  My sister still needs a lesson from me on occasion but one you've got it, you've got it.  I have some wishes regarding some of the apps, I wish it had the Fox News app that I can get on my roku, but otherwise I love it.  The remote is much easier than streaming with your latptop or  phone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jennifer Church"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Horrible product with glitches.  Moreover, no adequate technical support services.  It doesn't work on all TVs as. It reads some TVs as a recording device, which Mazon doesn't want to using!  Had calls with Technical support and they didn't even understand the problem as well as reviewers who posted their similar experiences. Do NOT buy until Amazon works out the glitches.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles Travis Canfield"}]
