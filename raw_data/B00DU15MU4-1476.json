I am glad i saved the $20 and got this in 2 days versus waiting the 2-3 weeks for a new one...well worth it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SarahMarie74"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Please let me begin by saying that my husband and I are Spring chickens at heart, but not in years, and not being too tech savvy although I am more so than he is, I'll leave those reviews to others.  I purchased the Fire TV box along with two Fire HDX 8.9\" tablets for our Christmas presents.  WOW, what an amazing experience we have had.  We love that we can watch a movie on the big screen and use our tablets at the same time to see all the actors, characters, trivia, and music info, and also watch scene by scene if we wish, and control our Fire TV from the tablets.  Completely freaked my husband out and he was not the only one.  I might add that neither of us have ever owned a tablet in our lives and are still learning, but having a great time.  As for setup, it took me longer to get it out of the box than it did to set it up and have it running.  The instructions are enclosed, were easy to understand and all went as it should, thankfully.  The Fire TV box is tiny so takes up very little room and sits perfectly on our HDTV stand right above our Cable Wi-Fi box.As a little tip I have found that it is much easier to find things to watch if  I use my laptop computer and go to the Amazon website to browse and  add them to my Watchlist there.  Then, when you go to your Fire TV and scroll down to your Watchlist on it, there they are and easy to find without a lot of searching or browsing.  As for the voice recognition, we were thrilled that it can understand our \"very mountain\" East TN accents.  This Fire TV is better at that than most people I talk with on the phone who are from \"elsewhere.\"  We are now addicted to Fire TV and have bought several movies of our own that were not Prime freebies, although there are many great programs that are free for Prime members and we take advantage of that too.  I don't think we could do without this now.  It has become an addiction, but a good one.We love our Fire TV and it has brought us much enjoyment.

She really needed something easy and simple because she isn't a electronic geek such as myself. Setup was very easy and anyone with little technology skills could set this up. Once setup I went and downloaded all the apps that I knew she would be using which came pretty easy since everything was categorized. I would have categorized it this way but was able to navigate with no problems. One issue that I had was Netflix it kept giving me an error about in the process of downloading and to wait? but I had never downloaded this app as of yet. I did find the problem out though was the one under recommended is not the one but you actually have to search for Netflix in the software apps category or something like that.As I finished with that she was very happy and started using it for her Netflix which didn't come to any issues till she tried the voice command. Unfortunetly the voice command only works for the main part of the OS and not for the apps that we could tell. So when she used it to find a TV series that was on Netflix it came up with the one on Amazon only. An even though I have Prime this was not one of the Prime TV Series that could be watched free.So all in all I give this 3 stars for working good easy setup but problems with the Netflix app and voice command only being able to us on the main OS not for the app software installed. I would recommend this item still for the non tech-geeks but that is what I think most of all the Amazon tech products were mainly made for.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sean Byrd"}]
