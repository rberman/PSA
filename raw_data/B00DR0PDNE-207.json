It's functionality is extremely limited. I knew that when I bought it, but I found it really frustrating when I actually started trying to use it. I can't blame Google completely; part of the blame rests with the app developers who don't allow their apps to be used with Chromecase (most notably SlingTV).One thing that really irritates me about the Chromecast is the fact that it needs one of my USB ports on my TV. My particular TV doesn't have a lot of ports available, and I always find myself unplugging one thing just to plug in something else.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Justin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "randy cave"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is perfect for pairing with YouTube specially if you have a pretty old LCD TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hassan Radwan"}]
