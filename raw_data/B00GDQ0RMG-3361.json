[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Good content. I had the same issue described by others where it would not pick up the wireless well. In its defense though,  I had another competitive device have the same problem in the same location. A Nintendo wii in the same place worked fine. It's working ok now,  after moving my router a bit and I intend to just get a wifi extender to solve the problem permanently.The content is great - tons of available apps and free stuff,  and the navigation and interfaces are well-designed and easy to use.My only gripe is that to install apps (which are not pre-loaded) requires linking to a billing address on the Amazon account.  This for some reason was not set up despite my having purchase history,  and had to be done online.Cool feature : you can browse and select apps on the website and load them directly to the device.  Very convenient,  but I didn't see it anywhere in the approximately 65 words of included documentation.  It may have been in the intro video,  but  I left the room since you can't skip it and it's really long and stupid. A simple Google search though and I was able to get apps installed and everything up and running  with only a little hassle.  Overall,  money well spent I think.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jon Baldridge"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "way too slow. only plays ~30 secs of video before it has to buffer again. we have appletv on another tv using the same wifi so it is not due to slow internet speed. most of the apps only intermittantly work. a real disappointment", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Courtney Maxey"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Fire stick is definatly worth the price.

We have a Roku, but this device seems to work even better.We have had some problem lately, though, where it seems to freeze. Not sure if it is the Fire TV Stick, or a problem with Netflix. The only way we have found to restore playback is by pulling the stick from the TV and disconnecting the power for 30 seconds or so, the reinserting it.
