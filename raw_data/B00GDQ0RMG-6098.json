Simply AMAZING!!!I have had or currently have all of the streaming devices available today.  My favorite until this precious gem arrived was my Apple TV.  There are some advantages and disadvantages of each device and I'll summarize them below.- Google Chromecast:  You need a laptop, tablet or phone to operate this device.  Which can cause all kinds of frustration.  Recently I was watching Netflix through my phone on my Chromecast.  I got a phone call from a bill collector right in the middle of a movie we were watching.  Totally killed my Friday night.  For $35 it's a great deal but it is not as easy to use as people think.  And it is not a stand alone device.- Apple TV:  Apple TV is great but I really wish Apple would update this unit.  I wish it had more of an IOS 8 look to it.  It is super easy and it works great.  But as a person who really is a tech head I wish Apple would keep adding more to this.  Maybe games, CBS TV App, etc.  But overall it's an excellent device.  At $99 I think Apple should lower the price to $79 or $49.- Roku:  After the latest update it looks way better.  If you want tons of channels and never want to leave the couch this is a great item.  But it's almost information overload.  They are too many weird apps and channels.  I think they should actually limit some.  But for the price it's great.- Fire TV Stick:  This is great.  It's not just a dongle.  There is an actual computer on this stick which is amazing.  It's a stand alone device that doesn't need anything else to make it work.  Video streaming has excellent quality.  With Amazon Prime this thing is incredible.  For $39 it is the best deal right now.  It's got everything I love; Movies, TV Shows, Apps, Games, iHeart Radio, Tune In Radio, NFL Now, Watch ESPN, and more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Docintherock \"Doc\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This Amazon Fire TV Stick has some serious wifi connectivity issue! The wifi connection interferes with cell phone mirroring to TV, and it's almost impossible to have both wifi connection and mirroring at the same time. If I have mirroring on, then the wifi network doesn't work.  I am going to buy Chromecast to compare the network performance.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Yu \"TV_fans\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Piece of junk.  I could not get it to connect to our wifi, but my daughter was right next to me watching videos on amazon prime through our kindle fire hd.  I had to constantly disconnect the power cord and reset the router until I finally got it to connect to the wifi long enough to do the software download.Then it loaded my prime account, but it would not let me watch videos.  It wanted me to pay to watch prime videos that were on my watchlist.  So I know it had my account information loaded.  So I figure I would de-register and log back in with my amazon prime account.  That was a mistake.  Now it's not recognizing my amazon account password.I'm very disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/5", "author": "CJH"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Arrived sooner and was everything I expected and more", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Larry Kinyon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jacek"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Setup was so simple!

Nicholson"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Upon receiving the unit, it requited an update that stopped half way through and made the unit freeze up.  From there I had to unplug the power, plug it back in and start the update over again.  However, once the update was done, the unit continued to freeze up through out the first week of using it.  Random apps do not work properly or freeze up, then the system just locks requiring you to reboot the unit by unplugging it and plugging it back in.  What a complete crap shoot of a product.  BTW, my Fire Stick was literally 1 foot away from my WiFi router that has 100/50 up down load speeds, so there is no excuse for Netflix, Amazon prime and more apps to have to buffer randomly through out the movies or shows.  Dont even try to use live tv like ESPN or Disney, thats a waste of time as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/4", "author": "kim"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I just received this a few days ago, so I don't have too much experience with it yet. However, it was very easy to set up and get running in just a few minutes. The remote is pretty intuitive as far as function, it's kind of small so I've already stuck some Velcro on it so I can keep track of it. The interface is pretty easy to follow, easy enough to set up your Netflix and Hulu accounts. It comes pre-registered to your Amazon Prime account if you've got one. That brings up my only concern so far, and it's more with Prime than this Fire Stick. There are an awful lot of the movies that not only require my membership but also a separate purchase of the movie or show. I kind of get that for brand new stuff, but not as much as I've found. That's just a bit disappointing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Janine Hansen"}]
