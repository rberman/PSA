I also have a Chromecast, but I would struggle to cast here and there.  With the fire stick, the integration to prime or netflix, and other apps is so much better.  I also LOVE that I don't have to have a phone/ tablet to make this work.  The remote is nice and easy AND if you would like your phone/ tablet as a other remote, there is an app for that.

My 48 inch vizio is still in good shape but I wanted to get rid of the cable box. Getting the Fire TV Stick worked very nicely. Was initially concerned with whether it turns off and stops drawing power...it is off when I get up in the morning, but I wonder if I can turn it off without unplugging it? Or does it go off with the TV?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cynthia in Elkton MD"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is everything and more than I expected.  I have cable in one room and wireless which makes the Fire Stick a savings tool.  My son will have only Wifi when he moves here and I have a Fire Stick to give him as a gift for the family.
