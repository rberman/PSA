There is a design flaw in the stick itself; it is too long. I have a 2 year old 42\" Samsung flatscreen. The molding on the back of the TV is con-caved at the location of the input jacks. Unfortunately the Fire Stick is too long to fit into that indentation. As such, I can't use it.I also have 2 Google ChromeCast adapters. They're great (just can't use Amazon Prime Video).", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "S.

I feel great not having to connect my laptop to the TV to always watch movies with the family!!!! Hassle free and easy set up! I am surprised to not have lost the remote for it being so small since I always misplace my iPhone 6 Plus!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sophoeun"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've owned my Fire TV Stick now for about two weeks and I'm really not sure why reviewers are giving this thing any less than 5 stars for what they're getting. $40 gets you 8GB of memory, 1GB of RAM, a VideoCore4 GPU as well as a power adapter that improves function of the device, a free android app with voice search (avoid paying $30 extra for the voice search remote) and an included remote control (without voice search capability)! That's awesome for this little thing! I mean, it puts out 1080p HD and from what I've seen the quality is outstanding. The images are very clear and the only noticeable lag I've seen after viewing probably 20 shows/movies was when my internet service wasn't working because of ISP issues. The only image quality issue I have with it is that every time a video reaches a part in the movie/show where the lighting is low, it can be hard to see the video. Most of the time the image can still be seen but sometimes not so much. This does not happen frequently enough that I think it reduces its value or is something worth complaining about especially if you are one of the ones (like myself) who only paid $20 for this fancy little gadget! If I were comparing it to some of the HD channels that I've watched on Xfinity or DirecTV well the quality is lacking in comparison to those but that's because these TV services provide significantly larger viewing boxes with far more capability than the Fire TV Stick. So, it's not a very fair comparison. If you look at the comparison chart that Amazon provides on their Fire TV Stick page, you'll see that Fire TV Stick has many of the same apps (YouTube, Pandora, Hulu Plus, Netflix, etc) as Chromcast and Roku Streaming Stick only the competitor's streaming sticks are less powerful. I have used both Pandora and YouTube successfully and they work great through this device! I haven't personally owned either one of the competitor's streaming sticks but I can tell you that, after owning the Fire TV Stick, I really don't care. I personally love the simplicity of the main menu that, tho simple, I actually find visually appealing. Navigation from the main menu screen to any movie, show, game or settings page is very quick and loading of movies and TV shows is also very quick. If you're a fan of Amazon Prime movie/TV show streaming, buy this and you won't be disappointed. If you also like Hulu Plus, Netfilx, YouTube and Pandora then I HIGHLY recommend this. What's more is with an android device that's Miracast capable (you can most likely find this where your Bluetooth settings are) you make the Fire TV Stick mirror whatever is on your android device. I learned this last night, set it up and it worked perfectly! Thought that was a fun little feature. There really are several other features about the Fire TV Stick that are fun and convenient but just buy it and you can learn for yourself. It's more fun that way anyhow.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Joe"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love it!
