[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I bought my Chromecast about a month or two ago on Amazon and loved it. I watched youtube videos, netflix, and google play and never a problem. Recently I started having problems with youtube. It wont play the video and I get an error message that says \"There was an error playing this video, please choose another video\" I get this message constantly on youtube and it has gotten to the point that I get it every time.Earlier today the device showed that it was installing an update but since then it has been almost completely unable to cast from youtube. I now have a device that is great for netflix but youtube is no longer an option. I gave it a 2 because I can you youtube but I am very unhappy that I cant use youtube at all. I searched the net and found countless people who had the same problem. Just search Chromecast and There was an error playing this video, please choose another video and you will quick;y get the idea. If you want it for netflix, great, for youtube, good luck.  I just cant figure out why it worked so well with youtube for awhile and then crapped out.

I plugged roku to my receiver if I want to pass the sound through my sound system. The chromecast connected directly to TV.The main difference between google and roku is with roku, you have to browse every channel to get what you want. Yes, there are cast apps too on the roku but still need to go through multiple steps.With chromecast, you can instantly cast anything even from your web browser. No need to go through multiple steps. Quality of sound & picture very similiar to roku.I loved the flexibility of it. Plus google plan to invest more on developing the apps for chromecast in 2014 is very promising. go get it before the price goes up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kits \"Cats\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "use your android cell phone or tablet, or your PC to stream Netflix and YouTube to the TV.  very easy to install and set-up.

The whole Apple like \"enchantment\" experience. Right up until the part where the unit does NOTHING. Oh pretty pics on the TV screen. The  NETFLIX and YOUTUBE icons appear on the PC Browser, but they do nothing at all. Says it will do HBOGO, but not an option.

I've bought chromecast to use in my travels but it doesn't work in wireless that requires login and password every time you have access. I already have at home an Apple TV so Chromecast was useless for me.I hope Google update it's software and make possible to have access in that kind of network.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Biaggi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It does absolutely everything as it said.
