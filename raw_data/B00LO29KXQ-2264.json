The only thing that makes me regret my purchase is that there are no apps for Networks such as ABC and CW yet. I have read that there will be some eventually, but I watch shows on the Networks more often than Netflix so it would be nice if I could use one device for everything. Other than that, it's a good product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ashley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lucila Garza"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing product at a great price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "doylehead69 \"doylehead69\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it, Love it, Love it !!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.

Really user friendly. Fast download speed. Fun games. I downloaded HBO and Showtime apps and they work really well. The remote it comes with is small would be easy to loose, so I'd recommend downloading the remote app. The voice control on the app is great.
