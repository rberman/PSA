I ordered it through my regular Amazon account, so it came pre-configured, except for the WiFi connection, but the little set-up that remained was simple.  Initially, I was disappointed to learn that Comcast subscribers would not be able to use the HBO GO app on the Fire TV Stick, but that has since changed, and now I've got pretty much all of the streaming service I use dialed in to my Fire Stick.  I'm using Netflix, HBO GO, Hulu Plus, and of course, if you're a Prime member there are about a bazillion movies available on Amazon Instant Video.  I was rockin' the Google Chromecast before I got the Fire Stick, and I was hugely disappointed as Chromecast is utterly incompatible with Amazon Instant Video, which is cheaper for PPV rentals.  The lack of a remote with the Chromecast was also problematic for us, as the smartphone apps didn't always assure compatibility, and there are technology-deficient people living in my household.  A remote control is familiar to them, and as a result the Fire Stick gets a whole lot more use than the Chromecast did.  The Fire Stick can also let you play simple games from Amazon's app store, using your remote.This little tiny device is a cord-cutter's wet dream!
