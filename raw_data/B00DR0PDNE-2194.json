[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I think this product is a good option if you want to turn your old LCD into  a Internet connected TV. I bought the Chromecast 1 month ago and it works very good. Before the Chromecast I usually connected my laptop to my LCD using the  HDMI port, easy right\u00a1, However I had to do it every day, because I use the laptop to work and as a entertainment device. I'm user of Netflix, I can see smooth and clear movies and videos (youtube).
