Much nicer to use my smart phone to fling content than the clunky built in TV UI. High quality streams that start fast. I hope more apps include Chromecast support, especially Amazon VOD. This should be the thing that pushes Amazon into releasing a non-Kindle VOD player. The marketing material sadly leave off any mention of Linux, but this works perfectly fine casting URL's and tabs from Chrome on Linux. I am a bit disappointed that I have not received the promised 3 months free Netflix promo code. Google ended the promo quickly, but should at least honor it for devices purchased the first few hours of release.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "WARREN Avram"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Its a good product but I think that they will improve it son.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bud Spencer \"Sam\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This gadget is fine but it needs a lot of improvement. it is limited to some applications.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hani"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Its ok but a little quirky, need to spend more time with it.
