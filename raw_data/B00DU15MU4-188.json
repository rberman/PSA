Stop wasting money with these cable/satellite providers that don't let you pick channels, and overcharge for stuff you aren't watching.  Add Sling TV to your Fire TV, and pay very little.  You can also access Netflix, Pandora, iheart radio and so on.  If you have kids, you will find more than enough kids shows and cartoons.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisa M.

It is easy to set up and use, but the menu system has a bit of a learning curve.  I'm still not sure I'm using all of the functionality, but for quick easy streaming to my older but nice television, the Fire TV works well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.
