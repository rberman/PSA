[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is awesome.  I got it to replace my Roku 3 and it is so much faster.  Plus I love the addition of screensavers to help protect my plasma tv screen.  It is very fast and being able to add my Netflix and HuluPlus pleased me to no end.  I love this little thing!  So thankful that Amazon even included the adapter because without it I would not have been able to use it.  Well Done!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.

I also have a cromcast which also works well for my streaming and netflix.  so i am unsure if this device just has too much for my internet to download or what the problem is.
