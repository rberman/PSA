I would not have these gripes if I wasn't so spoiled by my Fire Tv. The Stick is still faster in loading lists of movies or tv shows than my Rokus.I like, many others bought this at a discount on a pre-order before Christmas and it was a deal I could not turn down. But the regular price is a deal in itself.I really like Hulu Plus on here because it is an easier version to back up  and re-watch something you missed since normally it is difficult to move around in an episode or movie unlike Amazon where it is very simple.The Fire is a much more open environment where you feel everything feels readily accessible to you unlike Roku where you have the feeling of being shut out because you have to open everything separately.And until I got the Fire Stick and the Fire Tv, I really wasn't watching Amazon Prime that much compared to now. And it is so much easier to find something to watch since it helps you with suggestions plus most movies have a trailer to watch beforehand to help you decide.I did have some connectivity issues at first with this Stick. It would not work right in my side HDMI slot and wasn't working in one on the back that was beneath another HDMI plug. Luckily, this HDTV has a lot of inputs and I was able to put it at the top above the other plugs. Now, I am not having any more issues and the Fire Stick is running smoothly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "chinagirl \"ncchinagirl\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it and the simplicity of use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Barbara L.

Only dislike is the navigational circle on the remote as it doesn't have obvious push points and I often push it in the wrong place thus have to push multiple times.
