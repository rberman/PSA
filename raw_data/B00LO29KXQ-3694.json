[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've had the Fire TV Stick for about a month now and I could not be more pleased! The set up is simple, and the navigation is pretty easy. I've seen some reviews have issues with streaming but I haven't seen any (fingers crossed). It's a great alternative to multiple cable lines in the house and is easily transportable. The only app I would like to see on this interface is HBOGo other than that this device is worth every penny.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Greg Hernandez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire Stick works very well. Our family enjoys the movies, the games, TV Shows, etc that are basically on demand. We look forward to when  movies, shows, and games in Spanish can be included.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Simco"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install. Great picture but the screen went black for just a second several times. That seems to have been fixed. I have enjoyed your Amazon original programs such as Alpha House.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. Causey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was absolutely amazed with the ease of installing the Amazon Fire TV Stick and how well it works.  The Fire TV Stick locked in to our network as soon as I entered the password. The instructions were brief, accurate and easy to follow. The unit knew that we were already subscribers to Amazon Prime, so there was no problem getting started with Prime viewing.  We have already enjoyed many hours of Amazon Prime programming.  We subscribe to Netflix also, so we can always find something that we want to view.All of this at a great price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carl Tee"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I'm going to return it today. I have WiFi in my home, obviously. But for some reason, the Fire TV Stick kept losing signal, resulting in repeated long delays while it paused to recapture a signal. Way too frustrating. I can't understand why this would happen, as I don't have problems with any other WiFi devices in my home. Besides this, I have a large screen TV, High Definition. But the shows I played through NetFlix were very, very blurry, extremely low quality. The Fire TV Stick is just not worth all these drawbacks.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christine E Miller"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great interface, clear picture--easy access for my viewing pleasure.  The only negative is that it occasionally will not pick up a wifi signal (which I know is strong).  Can I blame the stick?  Yes..I have a Roku and Xbox where I stream, and I do not have this problem with them.  However, this may be because this does deliver a higher quality image.  Worth it.  Overall, would recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christopher Shamburg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Even easier to use than I thought it would be!

Even though it does what its suppose to do, I can watch hulu, prime, and netflix.  The lag kills me from switching from app to app.  Originally I bought it so I didn't have to hook up my kindle fire to my TV directly but i've gone back and reverted to plugging my kindle directly to the TV again.  Hulu plus is spotty, some shows work and some shows don't, I hear sound for the show but no image plays.Overall it does what it does but its a little glitchy.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "baldwin thai"}]
