[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "So I moved and lost the rinky-dink remote they include with the Apple TV.  You're supposed to be able to set up the Apple TV w/ an iPhone, which I attempted but failed miserably.  I am not going to shell out another $20 for a tiny-ass Apple remote that I'm not supposed to need.  Apple talks such a big game with their stuff, but it's all bulls***.  I hope Apple as a company is not around in the next 10 years.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "2/6", "author": "justin cunningham"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install and use and really helps expand on what we have to choose from for viewing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GG"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very satisfied, no issue installing and configuring.
