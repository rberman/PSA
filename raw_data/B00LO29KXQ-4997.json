[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "This works fine, and accomplishes the purpose that I wanted it for, mainly being able to see Amazon streaming content which I wasn't able to do on my other video equipment.  A few concerns however:  I didn't realize that it needed to be plugged in to a power outlet to operate when I ordered it.  Luckily  I had one near to the set that I could use, but this could be a problem for some.  I am happy that the pictures that I have uploaded on the cloud with Amazon Prime are viewable with the stick and was expecting to be able to hear the music that I had on the cloud as well.  For some reason only two albums outs of hundreds that I have uploaded seem to be available for listening with the stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

My in-laws have less than 5mb download speeds and it was working just fine.  It took about 5min to buffer.  I wish the power cable could be longer, but that is my only complaint so far.

It's easy to use and fun to search all the free titles especially if you have AMAZON PRIME.  I was especially happy about the ease it took in setting it up.

Only complaint...need the ability to change to Standard Definition (SD) like you do when streaming on a PC.

My TV has only 2 HDMI ports so I had to but an extender to add more HDMI ports so that I could run Firestick and my DVR. Was surprised I had to have electric connection for the Firestick. I didn't like having to subscribe to other services such as You Tube (no charge) but inconvenient and Hulu (a charge so I did not subscribe). Not sure yet how I use (and why I should/could use) the phone app.I was hoping that the Firestick would give me an additional programming choice from cable but there are not many \"free\" options on Amazon.
