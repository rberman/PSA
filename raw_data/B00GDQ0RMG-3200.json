Learned the hard way this evening if you want to watch WWE network, you have a hard time accessing it. I had to unplug it for it to reset, and then it froze up and lost the sound.  This is not a happy report from me.  Watched movies with it and it was ok. Picture was really good but again, it at times would freeze up.  Not the best purchase for me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anna Saettel"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This device worked really well for about a week. Then, I started to have streaming issues with the hulu plus app (freezing, playing audio, but no video). Then Amazon music started to not load, or would play for a few songs, and then get stuck on the loading screen. Now, none of the apps work (hulu, Netflix, YouTube, prime video, prime music....). If they even load at all, I get error messages, or playback issues. I have tried all of the troubleshooting steps, and even worked with my internet provider to make sure that the issue wasn't on their end. So far, Amazon customer service hasn't done much to help. I'm so disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "One of my best purchases yet from Amazon!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Harper"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.
