[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.  We already had the full size Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV game controller for our living room.  When Amazon offered promotional pricing on the Fire TV Stick, we couldn't pass it up.  We now have one set up in the bedroom and one set up in the man cave.  With Amazon Fire TV and a HDTV antenna, we have been able to cut almost all ties with our cable company aside from internet.  Our cable bill averaged $200 a month and now it's only $79.99!  Plus for us, if you only have internet services, there aren't any taxes and surcharges driving your base bill up.  This means it's only $79.99 to our cable company every month.  The picture quality with the Fire TV Stick crisp and we haven't not had any issues with buffering, etc.  We our very happy with the purchase.  The only real drawback to the Stick versus the full box is that the stick does not include the voice search, but I believe you can utilize an app on your phone for this.  I just haven't found the need to.  There seem to be more and more apps everyday and plenty of free movies and shows, especially with a Prime account.  Even my parents have now made the change to Amazon Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Darth Rob"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great addition to our home and lets us decrease our cable bill.

I have a big screen 1080 and I applied it to hdm12. My security system with dvr is all connected in this console. It only took about 15 minutes to get it working. Everything is costly from that point on. There is a charge for all movies and I guess prime is next for me.The wonderful part-NO ADVERTISEMENTSFire TV Stick", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "richard corbett"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very good for the price.
