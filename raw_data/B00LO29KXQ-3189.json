Apparently that was added some time in January. It is now the end of March.I hardly us it. It's slow and has a clunky interface. The upside is I got it for under $20. Otherwise I would not recommend this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jay S.

Will not connect to the internet any longer. When it was working, the remote lagged terribly and you would end up in the main menu repeatedly. It doesn't turn off easily and it doesn't even have a display clock unless you download one as a separate app. I called customer service and they told me I was just out of luck and gave me a 5 dollar credit. I want my money back and I will never buy another Amazon brand item again I will put this in my pile of broken junk with my dead kindles.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The Firestick is OK, but not sure why Amazon would release something that could not cast from a computer, like the Chromecast.  Doesn't make much sense to buy this when the Chromecast does more for less money.  Not being able to cast is a huge loss of a feature, so I don't recommend until Amazon adds this functionality.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Sledhead"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "User friendly in setting up.

Learned the hard way this evening if you want to watch WWE network, you have a hard time accessing it. I had to unplug it for it to reset, and then it froze up and lost the sound.  This is not a happy report from me.  Watched movies with it and it was ok. Picture was really good but again, it at times would freeze up.
