Great if you are a Prime member and have no other way to use Prime music, videos, games, etc...  Problem is that the apps don't work with Charter Cable's authentication.  I have another device that streams Prime videos so I primarily bought this to use the Watch ESPN app and I can't.  If I had known this I would not have bought it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Revengeance"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "A few problems with this device that I'm sure Amazon will change in later iterations. It plugs into the HDMI port on your TV but then you have to plug in a USB power cable via an included wall A/C adapter. Even if your TV has a USB port (mine does) you can't use that port -- you'll get a screen message saying the USB port does not supply enough power. So when Amazon figures out how to power this without the mess of wires you have to connect to it I'll try it again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/8", "author": "T.

It would be cool if the playback was not so choppy. I know that the lag is not my internet because I am able to watch things on my kindle and phone with no issue. I will keep for the device mirroring but I think that will be my primary use for it.Eta to add a star. After using the hdmi extender I have seen some major improvement. So use the hdmi extender!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ebone"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The main reason I purchased this was to use Miracast. It's supposed to mirror my windows 8.1 computer to my tv. It doesn't work as claimed. I've searched the forums and it seems everyone has the same issue. If you don't need Miracast then yes this is a 5 star product.
