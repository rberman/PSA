Now it is just gathering dust while I wait for answers.  I haven't been able to stream Netflix for well over a month and no one seems to be listening.  This issue is pretty wide spread, a quick search will show many people are having the same issue.In the user forums I have been told its because I am using an unsupported device even though I told them I have tried multiple devices with the same outcome (Kindle Fire, Galaxy S3 rooted on custom rom, Galaxy S3 Mini Stock, iPhone 3G, 2 different PCs in different browsers), it has been suggested it is a router issue (Nothing on my router has changed), and I have tried factory resets and reinstallation on the Chromecast and my devices.If it ever gets fixed I will update my review.  Until then I can't in good conscience recommend this thing to anyone.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
