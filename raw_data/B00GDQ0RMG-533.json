Panning scenes are always subtly jerky - the scene surges rather than smoothly pans.A direct comparison between the Fire Stick and the Chromecast (same router hardware, position, etc) shows that it is inferior for streaming quality, at least with Netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gjs \"gjs\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "remote is glitchy, Hulu and Netflix streaming always seem to have issues however never amazon streaming...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark K."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is as good as the $70 Apple and waaaay better than Google.
