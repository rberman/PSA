Very easy to install and set up. Only took a few minutes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The problem with Fire TV is content.  80% of what we wanted to watch was unavailable, even though it shows pictures of the movies on the menu.  What is available tends toward the recent and purile.  Plenty of American Pie 12.  The thing itself works well and is elegantly designed, but the lack of available content makes it almost useless.  Also, remember you're paying $100 for Jeff Bezos to have a direct channel into your living room for whatever mediocre content he wants you to rent.  You're better off using the public library.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Sam Brown"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My family absolutely loves Amazon Fire TV. It was easy to set up and extremely easy to use. We were going to purchase another product but when we heard this was coming out we decided to wait and give it a try.
