My wife and I loves it so far, except it seems to keeping on rebuffering Netflix streams a little too often. This problem never occurs on our Apple TV, which is significantly further away from the WiFi router with Netflix, so I am pretty sure it's the TV Stick or the Netflix app is the culprit.By the way, this thing is great for side loading apps to make it do other things besides play videos and some games off the App Store. I will let your googling skills figure out what else this thing can do.If Amazon or Netflix can fix the continuous buffering issue, then I could jack this up to 5 stars, as this problem is very irritating. I should also mention that this problem even occurs on Amazon Prime videos, but not as often. I am unsure what causes, but I know it has nothing to do with my network, since Amazon Prime Videos play fine off my Blueray player and Netflix plays fine on other devices without a hitch. This is clearly a problem with the TV Stick", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patrick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "\u00a0I picked this up for use on business travel.
