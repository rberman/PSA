[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick has exceeded all expectations. The value, ease of use, and quality are all top notch. For years, I had been messing with items such as the MK802(insert generation here). They were awesome while they worked, but the poor quality control on those products meant many hours bridging connections and flashing its firmware to restore usability. Not the case with the Fire TV. Out the box, there's an extremely long intro that does nothing for me, and I couldn't skip it... But, I can see the value in the not-so-quick crash course for some first time users. Out the box, there are several free and subscription base apps available for streaming pleasure. This device is a must have for anyone with an Amazon Prime account. For those that do not, fear not, the free apps have plenty to offer. If those are not satisfying enough, there is a huge following on sideloading applications to this device. The quality control appears to be great, though one of our remotes were fritzy out the box.Overall, I've recommended this to family and friends. I also gave some away as gifts and the recipients were pleased with their gifts as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J. Lee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very intuitive. Set up could not have been easier, and user interface is very fast. I had a Sony bluray player with apps I was using to stream amazon media and was having a miserable experience. It would stall, or stop, not advance fast or took too long to load. The fire stick in comparison is lightening fast and will allow me to stream content in a useable and functional platform. I'm very excited about this product and the service.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matthew Schneider"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought the Fire TV Stick because I was sick and tired of my PS3 not logging into the PSN network, and not letting me watch my Netflix account.

Installation and setup was a breeze.  The menus were a little crowded for my tastes, but it was pretty easy to navigate around, even with the super-basic remote (no QWERTY keyboard?).  Tried streaming a few things on Prime, and they looked great.  And then came MLB.tv.  *Sigh*.  Buffering and buffering and buffering all day long, between every pitch.  Every... pitch!  I will be returning this for either Chromecast or Roku or Apple device.  Sorry little Fire Stick, but you don't hold a candle to the competition.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.

Response very quickly to button click. The only bad thing I can think of for this is there are not many apps or games available. There are more apps for Fire TV but not this stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shang Tseng"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this for a guest room and I love the convenience of it!  I wouldn't use it over satellite for one of the main TV's in my house, but it's perfect for a guest room that doesn't get used that often.  As a Prime member, I'm easily able to watch Prime content and listen to Prime music, but then I'm also able to log-in to my Netflix account too.  And when there's no one in the guest room, I can just unplug it from the guest TV and plug it into my main TV -- making it easier to watch my Prime content all the time!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.
