Don't use the apps to much as I already have a smart tv so for me the big feature was the streaming and it does that amazingly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J. Shoemaker"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This little device lives up to the hype. Streams Netflix and YouTube flawlessly. Super simple set up. The added support of Plex and Hulu Plus make this really a great value. Only draw back so far: had Chromecast for about 3 months, and in that time, I've had to re-configure the device twice to work on my network even though I've never changed the setup or its physical location. Hope this doesn't keep happening. Minor bug I suppose. Perhaps will get (or has been) fixed with the automatic updates.

The thing i love about the Chromecast...it streams anything you can play on your chrome browser.  For me...i have showtime anytime...unfortunately neither my roku, apple tv or ps4 have an app.  That's where this bad boy comes handy...i can now stream showtime anytime straight to my TV.  Same for those shows on Hulu that you cant use the streaming app for...they also work.  Quality it good and its super simple to set up.  For $30...this thing is amazing.  I'm buying a couple to give as gifts.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "anthony"}]
