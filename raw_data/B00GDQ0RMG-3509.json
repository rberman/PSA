I have the Fire TV Stick, Roku 3, Chromecast and smart TVs. This one is easy to set up and flat out works.  But so do the others as well.  This one gives me Amazon TV as well, and I like the show 'Bosch'.

It arrived back in December, was easy to set up and worked great at first. Now, only a few months later, it constantly loses the wireless connection, even though the TV and Stick are in the same room with no obstruction in between except for the TV itself. Either the picture freezes and the voice continues to play or the voice gets stuck or out of sync with the picture, or it just quits and goes back to the home screen. I have to unplug the Stick from the TV, disconnect it from the power source, let it sit for a few minutes, hook everything back up and start over. Sometimes it's good for a couple of days, sometimes only for a couple of hours. I'm not sure it's even worth the hassle of sending it in on a warranty claim.  While I'm giving that some thought, I think I'll still replace it with another Roku Stick. I remain an Amazon fan, just not a fan of the Fire Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lizzier"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Works well but ONLY when very near the wireless modem.
