However it is very unstable at first I thought it was my Internet.

Three remotes and 5 minutes what ever I wanted to watch would be up and running.  With the Fire Stick, swap the TV over to HDMI for input (it's normally on HD) and it's up off we go.  I don't have to change to audio, it continues to use my surround sound through the TV without changing the input, and streaming starts.  In less than a minute I can watch whatever I want.There is less buffering, as in none.  It experienced a little when I first set it up after that none.  Set up is less than 10 minutes, plug it in to the HDMI port, power into an outlet, find the wireless network, sign in, that is it.Great for binge watching a series.  One episode ends, the next is queued and ready to start without any input from me.I'm very happy with my purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "can not make it turn on, I may have change router set up, i don't remember how, would take me half a day. not as simple as plug and turn on!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "mike t reilly"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Much faster and more responsive than going through a Blueray device.
