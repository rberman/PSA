The only drawback (always room for improvement) was trying to enter names, passwords, search names, etc. It just takes some doing to spell out longer names/words. Otherwise I never had a problem with it. I've decided to pick up a Tivo unit.  The stick will be used on a yet to be purchased HDTV for another room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott A.

I don't know if that's Hulu's fault of Amazon's fault, but every show I watch freezes on the Fire Stick.  I know it's not my connection because when I plug in my Roku there are no problems.That said the Amazon fire stick has a nice interface and is really good at Netflix and Amazon.

The stick let you play your music very easy from Amazon and watch your movies with ease.  The only downside is that the stick requires AC power which means it is not portable like Chrome Cast to view on various devices.  I like it because it have many more apps that are downloadable than Chrome Cast.  However, I wish I knew how to organize them once they are downloaded.  Also, I noticed that I have to remove the micro cord from the USB if I want to watch regular TV due to the interruption in the antenna feed.  Although I like this better than Chrome Cast and the other streaming devices, I would probably love it if it did not require AC power to the USB device so that it is more portable.  If Amazon makes that change the Fire TV Stick would be number one in my book.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "PC"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like the fire stick, but i hate the men's you have to scroll through, I liked it before, when you had all the movies showing on the page and you would go through the entire page and go to the next page, with this method, i'm kind of forced to watch what is presented to me with 8-10 movies...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Justin Moore"}]
