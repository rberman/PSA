The internet strength in the home is great but this fire stick sucks. I am returning it. I would rather watch Netflix out Hulu on my tablet. At least it doesn't buffer. Total waste of money.

The only problem I have had is with the Hulu app, it stutters and sometimes quits, sometimes the picture goes out but you can still hear sound. I think this is probably a hulu app problem and not the fire stick because Netflix and Amazon Prime work perfectly. I love the Fire stick app on my phone too, it controls everything and even has voice search!
