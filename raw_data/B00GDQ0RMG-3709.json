[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "It arrived ready to plug in and use. I was pleasantly surprised that Amazon had pre-programmed the device with my Prime account information, saving me the bother of entering account numbers, passwords and the like before I got started. Ten minutes after I received it, it was plugged in and working; and that includes unpacking it. There's a vast library of free Amazon Prime programs to watch and the fact that this device is seamlessly linked to them is perhaps its greatest selling point. I also have a Roku box, but I haven't turned it on since I received the Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Pep"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "i was excited to get the Fire TV stick as part of the Sling TV promotion, but the reality of the product has left a bad taste in my mouth. The Fire TV was going to be attached to a 20\" wall mounted TV in my dining room. The initial set up is super easy. But the device kept dropping wifi connection when trying to connect to HULU plus or Netflix. And when the connection failed the device would do a quick reboot then back to the home screen. I restored the device to factory. Rebooted the device several times. Same issue. Over and over. After a chat with tech support I was told that I HAVE to use the included HDMI extender because the TV was blocking my wifi signal. What? There is no documentation stating this. And I have never had this issue with any other streaming product. Using the extender means that the device dangles below the TV and defeats the purpose of wall mounting a TV and using cable housing to hide the cables. Meaning the product can be seen at all times just hanging there. So I tried it for a little bit. Guess what? The issue was still the same. A little better. But still kept dropping signal. More chat with tech. Support and they decided to send a replacement unit. That unit arrived and was even worse than the first one. Same issues. Dropping connection. Rebooting. Tech support again told me the extender was designed to improve the signal. There are other streaming sticks that do not have this issue. So. I have now paid $68.41 for the Sling TV promotion and have a free defective product. Sling won't give me my money back and I can't exchange this for the ROKU stick. So I am out of the money paid and have to return this product because I refuse to use such a poorly designed device. Get the Roku stick instead. Fire TV stick is not ready for primetime yet. Some might have better luck. And just a little background. My home network has multiple devices all connected and not having any connectivity issues seen with this product. Go to the fire TV support pages. Tons of people have the same problems I had. Amazon needs to fix this ASAP.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Matt Ficarelli"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product and so inexpensive.  My son got it for his 7th birthday, and it's so easy to use.  He loves the games that come with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jennifer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is my first experience of streaming to TV and I'm loving it. Amazon streaming series and movies are top notch.  Already a Netflix member, I am trying out their streaming now and am thoroughly enjoying perusing the many other content resources on the Firestick. Both my new TV and my new Fire TV Stick were installed last weekend, so my rating is based on my being new, not necessarily knowledgeable...but liking what I've experienced so far. To date, my only complaint is the infrequent buffering that seems to have increased with items viewed, but I am patient! Perhaps there is an easy solution? TWC says I have a very fast connection. If not for that inconvenience, I'd give the Firestick five stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Andrea Wilson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome device.  In my opinion, better than Roku's stick or Chromcast which I will explain why later.What I like:1) More powerful, more RAM, and more space than either of the other two sticks, to my knowledge.2) Cheaper than Roku's stick, and only a few $ more than Chromecast.3) It works on android's operating system which means you can sideload android apps (like Kodi aka XBMC)4) Portability.  It's an android computer on a stick.  Sure it's not as snappy as my android tv box or a computer, but it's meant to be portable so I forgive that it's not uber powerful.5) Wifi works well from my testing.  Better than the Chromecast I had.6) Inexpensive.  When you consider the possibilities for this stick, a $39 computer is just unheard of.7) Along with XBMC, I like the dedicated Amazon video/music features.  I essentially have any entertainment at my fingertips in a $39 package.What I don't like (all of which are forgivable considering the possibilities, pricepoint and intended use):1) The apps aren't super snappy, but snappy enough for the portability tradeoff.2) Need to plug into an outlet sometimes.  I've ran into this on 3 of 4 tv's, but they were a little older, so it makes sense.  My new 4k tv had no problem powering the device through usb.3) Solely a wifi unit.  To be expected given package size, but in my dreamworld, It'd have an ethernet jack.4) Maybe a cover or carry case to protect the HDMI plug when being stored would be nice,So everything I didn't like about it is forgivable, because the possibilities for the unit with it using android more than make up for it.  I'm an android user and love the fact that I can treat it as such by putting android apps on it.  Their are a couple of different ways to do it, and you can do it with apps already on your phone and by downloading the APK files onto your computer and uploading them to the stick.  If you aren't familiar with XBMC (now called Kodi) then you're missing out.  The nice thing about this particular android stick compared to the others on the internet is that even though there are others out there that are more powerful, this one at least is mainstream and has tech support through amazon should you need it.  You can't necessarily say that for the dedicated android sticks.Though this stick doesn't have as many \"channels\" as the roku stick, XBMC trumps that in my opinion.  Any many people love the chromecast for it's tab casting thing.  You can do that with this stick too, it's called miracasting.  You might not be able to do it from your laptop or pc, but I personally don't find that feature appealling considering most of what I want to cast is on my mobile device, and I'll take the dedicated remote of the firetv stick over the forced usage of smart phone with the chromecast.This stick is not perfect.  It does have it's flaws, and some people like it, and some don't.  It all comes down to personal preference.  But I can't say I dislike this product.  It's my android tv on a stick.  I can stick it in my bag and take it on trips or like I did recently, used it at the hospital while my wife was there.  Had all my videos from home available there in the hospital room.  Couple that with all the features that Amazon preloaded onto it, and you have everything you need.  Having tried all 3, I'm vouching for this one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "L. Wohlscheid \"Larysius\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing peice of technology!

At times it is a champ and runs smoothly with WatchESPN, Plex and other apps. Then there are times when it constantly wants to drop my network connection or speeds suffer despite every other network device in my house running smoothly.The UI is also a bit hit or miss. I like how everything is presented with Prime movies and other apps, but at times I wish there was more advanced controls and the ability to control how much is running. The UI is a bit basic at times and it makes it frustrating.Overall when the Fire TV Stick works, it works fairly well. That said, I believe some software and firmware updates could really help it be a more consistent and wonderful product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Calvin Alexander McDermid"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!
