The Kindle Fire Stick is easy to install and setup.  Takes just a few minutes.  I have 30MB internet download broadband speed with a 5G wireless connection going and it is working great for movies, shows, etc.  Easy to operate and the apps are great.  Highly recommend.  If you don't need the gaming, save yourself the $60 difference in price and you should be happy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.L.W."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to set up and use.

Customer service was so horrible had I been a first time Amazon customer I never would have bought anything from them again.  These units are defective.  I bought this before the holidays hoping to have an easy way to access Amazon Prime through my TV.  Wrong.  All you have to do is do a google search on Fire Stick doesn't work and you'll find plenty of customers who are probably too pissed off to bother writing a review.  I tried all the fixes suggested.  Finally I thought I would exchange it for one that worked (if that was even possible).  I got transferred  to 5 different people and was told to wait on hold by each of them... each one telling me they weren't authorized to exchange my product.  What a time sink!  Unless you're looking for a new hobby ... you should definitely pass on this unit!!!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Naomi B Duane"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I have intermittent issues with Netflix not streaming.
