Valiantly,  but Amazon says Too Bad, Too Sad...On Amazon Prime Day I tried buying the Fire Tv Stick...  just to try Fire out before going further...  tried repeatedly to purchase the Fire Stick, but Amazon's website issues caused the whole page to freeze each time I tried...  I rebooted several times, close the site and reopened as many times, found that item sold out, but a waitlist was available.  Clicked over and over, no response to any.  Finally as I was frustratedly clicking away, a little text box pops up saying I am on the waitlist already.  So, I waited, searched for emails, notices, any link to waitlists on the website...  nothing.Yesterday I noticed the same item is being shown for sale, at a much higher price...  so I contacted Amazon via the website chat.  After several transfers, each one reading my story first and then putting me on hold, I was told to close chat and retry, they couldnt get into my account.  I did, more transferring.  Finally was told I needed to give my phone number so someone from Fire tv could call me...  they dont have chat...I did this... was told that everything was sold out, and that I need to just go pay the regular price now if I want it.Wow....  like I said.... I was willing...  apparently the mighty Amazon is only good at delivery.  Customer service and website... not so much....", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.

Easier than hooking up my iPad to the TV (iPad>AV connector>HDMI>TV).  Only issue I have with it is that it appears to not follow Dolby's guidelines regarding Dolby Digital Plus (DD+).  From the Dolby Digital Plus website (http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-digital-plus.html):\"Compatibility with Current Equipment-------------------------------------------------------Equipment with Dolby Digital Plus will unlock its full feature set, including 5.1- and 7.1-channel capability (depending on the program).If your system includes only Dolby Digital, you'll still get 5.1-channel surround sound, with the highest-quality Dolby Digital signal possible\u2014Dolby Digital Plus content is easily converted to a traditional Dolby Digital signal.\"However, it appears that the Fire TV Stick isn't providing a properly encoded Dolby Digital 5.1 signal (if at all) in that my A/V Receiver can't process the stream.  It's an older receiver and doesn't support DD+, but  has no problem with Dolby Digital 5.1 from multiple devices.  When the Fire TV Stick is set to output \"Dolby Digital Plus\" then my A/V receiver doesn't put out any sound.  If I turn off DD+ in the Stick menu (i.e. output only stereo) my receiver can then output the 2 stereo channels.  This has apparently been a known issue for quite some time (see the Amazon Customer forum thread on this topic:  http://smile.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/forums/ref=cs_hc_g_m_oldest?ie=UTF8&forumID;=Fx1SKFFP8U1B6N5&cdThread;=Tx1KOVJHREPPETT&cdSort;=newest).  Had I known that I may not have bought the stick.  And it seems from the forum messages that this issue also plagues the Fire TV (box).So, if you're not using a surround receiver at all (i.e.just 2 channel stereo), the TV Stick should work great for you.  But if you plan on using it with a surround sound system, make sure it will support Dolby Digital Plus streams, at least until Amazon implements the 5.1 stream (properly?).  I, of course, used the fact that the Fire TV Stick (gave $24 for it on Prime Day) doesn't support DD 5.1 properly to justify to my wife the purchase of a new receiver that *does* support Dolby Digital Plus (~$500).  Hope she doesn't read my reviews. :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian_254"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love how easy the Fire stick was to install and set up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Krista K"}]
