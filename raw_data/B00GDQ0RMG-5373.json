I got 2 and they are awesome. It has so much to offer for such a small price. I used the USB in my tv to power the device instead of taking up an extra plug. I attached a few photos upon receiving the device and some initial set up. I love the screen saver it's a nice touch. I love love the prime music, I wish it were a little easier to work on the fire stick because you can't search music from it (or maybe I havnt found it yet...)  but I can add music on my laptop and sent it to the stick. Also it would be great to search a movie from its title, so i have to do that from my laptop too. Some of the apps cost coins which is understandable but I would like a demo of the game prior to purchase. You would need a controller for some so that is an extra cost but of course cheaper than a xbox or ps system. It's nice to not have to hook up my laptop to the computer to watch a prime movie with the family. A very convenient and fairly easy to use device!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "M.

After a little trouble getting the Fire TV Stick started (just opening the battery case was a challenge requiring a Youtube search), we are mostly happy with it.  During daytime hours, we've picked up all kinds of great shows and movies we never knew existed. Ironically, we're enjoying the tunein radio app to pick up internet radio of favorite far-off stations.However, both weekend evenings (Dec 26 and 27) after receiving the stick, when we wanted to watch movies on the Netflix app, the Fire Stick stopped recognizing our network, and would not load anything.  All other internet devices in the house worked fine.  Multiple online chats with Amazon customer service did not help. They made suggestions from the online Q&A; (reboot, unplug, etc.).  Finally, they told us just to wait awhile, and it would fix itself.  Instead of using the stick, we resorted to hooking up Netflix directly from a PC.  The Fire Stick finally picked up the network when we checked close to midnight.I'm not a techy person, but this might be a bandwidth issue, though Netflix ran fairly well from the PC for a Saturday night. After looking at Fire Stick forums, I see that others are having the same problem.  I gladly will give more stars when we receive uninterrupted service.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "M Dan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I absolutely love the Fire TV stick. I also have the regular Fire TV which is amazing. We gave the Fire TV to all our family for Christmas.More about the Fire Stick. When I saw this come out we ordered 2. We are currently using one in the playroom for the kids. Since the kids primarily watch Netflix, Disney Junior, & PbS this is perfect for them. It frees us up from paying for a cable box in the playroom and the kids have the ability to watch there favorite shows anytime.While I still thing the regular Fire TV is worth every penny I think there better used in a room where you watch TV all the time. The sticks are perfect for rooms where the TV is used less but you still get the  convenience & benefits that fire offers. Excellent product. A+ Amazon.
