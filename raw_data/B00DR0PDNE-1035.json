[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you can't afford a smart tv this is the answer and more.Ok so out of the box I was a bit disappointed. On a galaxy s3 it wasn`t great. A few apps later and its all singing all dancing. I doubt this will be great with Apple products but it works great on Androi, I would research it first.. I`m not going to write a long essay on how to get this to work, just do a bit of internet and app searching for chromecast compatible apps and you wont be disappointed.I can watch movies from my phone, not all formats are compatible but a lot are. I`m currently streaming Xmen to my tv in 1080p seamlessly as I write this. It took about 10 minutes to set up and I'm no genius.Google have packed a lot of technology in a powerful unit. I wanted a \u00a3500 Samsung smart tv but this was like giving my T.V steroids. Its also very transportable and can be used on any tv with a hdmi around the house.The only thing I cant get it to do very effectively on an S3 is screen mirroring.. It is available on the chromecast app for Galaxy S4 onwards and other phones ie Nexus and other top spec phones. Although I've not researched other phones thoroughly. I`m babbling now. \u00a318 pounds paid in a Comet sale by my partner and the best xmas present I've had for years...", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J. D.
