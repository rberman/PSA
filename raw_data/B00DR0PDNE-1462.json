[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am so happy with my purchase! Google Chromecast was super easy to install, and it is even easier to use! I don't know how I ever survived without it! I love the fact that one can stream content to my tv, and still be able to use other apps in my iPhone or iPad. It's convenient, user friendly, and the PRICE!!!!! Can't be it. Trust me, once you get this tiny, cool , super device, it will quickly become indispensable. Makes great affortable gifts too!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elda Andrea G."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought a Smart TV and prefer the Chromecast over Samsung's built in features.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joshua"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "exceptional piece.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "vish"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "In order for this to work you must DOWNLOAD the Chromecast App on your PC and/or phone.

I was under the impression I'd be able to watch ANY program on my iPad and stream it through the HDMI media player.  Not the case.  I was hoping to stream NHL GameCenter Live from the iPad to the TV w/o using the Digital A/V Adapter and HDMI cable.  Not the case.  Chromecast only streams from certain apps.
