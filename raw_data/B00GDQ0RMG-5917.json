I have a Fire TV on my main TV and set up the Stick on one of my other TV's for my wife. Setup took mere minutes without incident. Looking forward to the iOS app to make the stick even better. Would recommend this product as either a primary or secondary device.As an aside, I love the packaging Amazon has chosen for its electronic devices.

I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't do my research on this stick as I didn't know that I wouldn't be able to move away from Amazon's ecosystem. Granted, this is to push their ecosystem, but I would have enjoyed it if they didn't have EVERYTHING they have on the home screen. Plus, today I even saw an ad on the homescreen. That is what's really ticking me off", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
