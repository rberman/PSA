As it uses phone/tablet as the controller it beats having to enter data using the TV remote. It also have more apps available than what LG provides to stream content (i.e. the typical Youtube, NetFlix, Crackle, and Hulu services ) on the Smart TV. There are more and more apps available on Google Play store every day. In Canada, CTV Go (free) was the first broadcaster to provide support for ChromeCast so you can now binge watch on missed episodes.But the BEST movie watching app by far is Web Video Caster (free) which can stream most movie or tv streaming sites without needing to use Chrome Browser as it has its own built in browser. Type in the URL in the address box, select the movie, and play it in whatever resolution including HD, then tap on the Chromecast icon and it will stream to the TV. I have had no lags issues at all watching HD content that some reviewers complain about.
