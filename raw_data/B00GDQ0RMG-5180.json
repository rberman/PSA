I bought this to replace the Plair (never worked) and It works fine.  The usb power has to be supplied via an outlet as my Samsung TV doesn't provide enough juice to power it.  Thats the only downside.  I brought this to the Caribbean hoping to use it however the geographic limitations prevented its use.  I would think its perfect for travel within the US but I havent tried that.  I would imagine the wireless access in hotels would prohibit its use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TS New Canaan CT \"Thomas Sill\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Still learning", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patsy R.
