[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "When it can actually connect to the internet, it's just \"OK\".  My Fire TV Stick is literally 3 feet from my wireless router.  I have 50 mbps DL service, so streaming really shouldn't be that much of an issue.  It cuts out of HD CONSTANTLY, and it often rebuffers.  This is mainly on HBOGo.  With upgraded internet service, and this device literally 3 feet from my wireless router, how on earth does this happen? I'll stick it out, but only because I also have a Roku and AppleTV on my other 2 TV's.  This will more than likely just become an accessory that stays plugged into my TV, but is rarely, if ever, used.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jfreese"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
