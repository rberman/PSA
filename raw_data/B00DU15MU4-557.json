I already had prime so it was a no brainer to get this,  I use it with Hulu and Netflix and Prime. And I don't miss my old setup. Or satelite bill.  For the money saved getting rid of Dtv this paid for itself in the first month, I will buy more for my other rooms next time a sale pops up,  we purchased a smart tv so this is now in my master bedroom,  I bought mine packaged with the game controller.  I haven't used it yet but for $20 dollars more I figure it was a smart buy, there are a lot of free games, so it will be handy when my daughter gets older,  One word of advice. Do not pull the cord while performing an update it will basically freeze the unit and make it a black brick, I did this not knowing.  Amazon kindly sent me another box. So it's all good.  Very easy to use and I like the interface better than my $3500 smart TVs", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Blackbird"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy to install.

While this is not the worst device I have owned, it is not far off...Apple TV won that honor.Similar to AppleTV, the Amazon devices seem to be focused more on interface design (not to be confused with usability), than providing a device with a stable connection.  The buffer functionality to learn what you commonly watch to be able to start the movies quicker is ridiculous, as it always starts the shows immediately, but within a matter of seconds it begins the lagging process to \"catch up\" to it's jumpstart.  So, instead of being patient up-front for a seamless experience, it is instant gratification with a jagged viewing experience.The search functionality seems to be designed to make it cumbersome if you don't want to use voice search.  Perhaps a bit of paranoia on my side, but I'd prefer not to willingly allow my voice to be stored in the cloud.  I realize that these types of devices can obtain voice and video images unknowingly (ahem...NSA).While the Roku interfaces may not be as fashionable, they seem to be a much simpler and more reliable device.  One evening I was having constant lagging issues with the FireTV...I couldn't watch for more than 15 seconds, before I was either dropped from the network or had to wait.  I I went through several reboots starting with FireTV, moving on to the wireless router, and ultimately to the modem.  Finally, I disconnected the FireTV and hooked up a spare 5+ year old Roku and it streamed without flaw for the remainder of the evening.If you are looking at Roku's, I would strongly caution against the newest Roku 1, as it has been the most unreliable Roku I have owned to date and had to return quickly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "sweebot"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great device.
