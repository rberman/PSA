The only regret I have is that audio can only be routed to HDMI (there should be possible to send it through Bluetooth with some hacking). With some hacking, too, you can install Kodi and watch your own videos stored in your home network.If you are planning to use an A/V receiver, you better go for the full version.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Feanor"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works as advertized.

The video freezes a lot with this and it's  super annoying.  I hope it's something they work on. I have had it for several months now so I really gave it a go. Also sometimes it won't play the video just the sound it gives some kind of resticted message. You have to plug and unplug it multiple times to get it to work. Also it goes to sleep and you cant wake it up with the remote it's another unplug replug situation. I do think that navagation is good. I just wish it streamed smoothly.
