[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got this Fire Stick specifically to watch Netflix on my tv at home, and it has been so awesome!  It was very easy and intuitive to set up, although it does take a bit of time to do so because you have to type wi-fi password in with the included remote (and in my case download the Netflix app and put in your password to that as well).  Now that it's connected, it's quick to start up and load my shows.  I have never had cable, so for me this has been a very cheap alternative and a real treat.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Heather"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far so good.
