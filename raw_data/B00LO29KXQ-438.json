When the first one didn't make it to the house customer service tried to make me feel like they were doing me a favor by sending another one. Won't be ordering to much from them if at all in the future.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel Chiswell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very satisfied w/ stick. I am not tech wavy & it was easy for me to set up. We use it on our larger, not so smart, TV to access Netflix & Hulu. The sound is better than normal use of TV & saves having to buy a new TV.
