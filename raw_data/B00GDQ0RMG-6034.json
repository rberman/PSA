[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I was so excited to finally find a product that supports both HBO and Showtime, however it doesn't not really. It does not support Showtime with Direct TV as a provider, Seriously??? It's only the 3rd or 4th largest and the largest via satellite and it only provides some programming from HBO via Prime so it is essentially useless to me. There is also no type of app store amazon or otherwise where you can download apps you can only use the ones provided for by the stick which is very limited. It also runs very slow so slow that it keeps telling me that itself and suggests I check my connection, which I run everything else on with no issues. Please someone tell me what I'm missing here??", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Rachel L.

My Roku 3 is better but this is fine.  Apps that are free on Roku are not free on the Fire Stick,", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. Rainey"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I own a Roku stick and since I had Prime I decided to try this. The interface is better than the Roku. The games are also a nice touch. I would put the Fire stick over the Roku. Three things stand out over the Roku right now. Interface, the games and the price. The specs seem to be better as well more ram etc. Also when your playing say a TV series on the Roku I have yet to find a setting that will play each episode consectutively you have to pick up the remote and press play for the next episode.  With the Fire Stick it will show you that the next episode is getting ready to play at the bottom right of the screen and then automatically play it without you having to do anything.  I think that might put me over the edge and I'm pretty sure I will eventually buy a second stick and put it on my main TV because of that.  Very simple yet convenient feature.  Just noticed it yesterday after using the Roku and I tried to find setting to fix it but no luck.  The set up was also very easy.  I didn't even have to log in to my amazon account.  When I connected to my home Wifi it took about 10 minutes of time to download software updates and then it was ready to use.  When I set up the Roku it took me 2 hours because I got the dreaded error 014 (or something like that) and it took me forever to find the fix to get it to work.  Overall I'm very happy with the Fire Stick vs. the Roku Stick.  There is also an extension for your HDMI hook up which is helpful if you have no room behind your TV for the stick.  I normally don't preorder anything so I was a little hesitant because this was the first wave of product to hit the customer and normally I'm sure there may be bugs to work out.  So far, so good, overall very happy with it.  I would highly recommend if you don't have a smart TV or are looking for something smaller than a streaming box.Updated: 12-21-14I have to retrack my statement about the Roku Stick.  The newest software update that the Roku has sent out allows the TV episode that you are watching to continue play without having to hit anything on the remote.  Big improvement but the interface is still the same.  Since this was a Fire TV review, I still really like the Fire TV stick.  It's in my bedroom and comes in handy when there is nothing on TV.  I stil like the interface with better than the Roku and would still but the Fire Stick over the Roku Stick for the same three reasons above.  Interface, games and price are still the factors as to why I would tell someone to get the Fire Stick over the Roku Stick.Updated: 6-3-15Had to knock off a star for this device.  Because between the Roku and Amazon Stick you get more chanels and options from the Roku than the Stick.  For example, I was watching documentaries on PBS on the Roku on my main TV in the living room.  When I went upstairs to keep watching it in bed the Amazon Stick had no way of showing it.  Becuase it didn't have a PBS channel or app to chose from.  With the PBS channel on the Roku you can watch pretty recent episodes and shows.  I will say that there are features and things on the Amazon stick that are not on the Roku but after a few months I would rather have another Roku stick to replace the Amazon Stick.  The only reason I won't is my kids like to play the games on the Amazon Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J-Rod"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I Have purchased one and it is on back order till Jan,why does best buy have them for 25$...why do we have to wait so long.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/7", "author": "Anita E.

Despite my iPads, windows tablets, Windows PC's, media center PC's, or any phones I've had, I've not done any streaming.I thought I'd try this since I had a half price deal on it pre-launch.  I figured I'd use it in my son's bedroom on his TV that is in there for his Xbox.  He could use it for the cartoons and such available on the Prime subscription.It arrived, and setup was freakishly easy.  It ran a semi long update right out of the box, so despite being brand new and just delivered after release, they clearly are trying to fix issues and push updates as needed.  That's always a good sign, as long as the fixes don't break something else.My big requirement for this was that I could lock purchases.  I didn't want my 11 year old inadvertently trying to watch something that wasn't free with Prime and suddenly seeing a bill at the end of the month.  But the initial setup didn't offer any options other than parental controls on / off.  I turned them on, and it annoyingly forced us to enter my pin every time he changed to a different show.  I finally found in the settings the option for not requiring it for prime videos, but still requiring it for purchases.I've had a Kindle Fire HD that I gave away the day after I purchased it because I just couldn't stand the carousel they use.  It's such a pain to get at anything after the ease of Windows devices and Apple devices.  And while this does a great job streaming music that is in my Amazon account, it's that annoying carousel thing again, which makes it a pain even for my modest 300 or so songs I've purchased through Amazon.  I hate having to scroll through EVERYTHING to get at something.  So it's this same kind of interface here that made me take a star off.The navigation otherwise isn't too bad for the normal things. Different types on the left such as TV shows, movies, music, photos, and as you pick one, the options on the right side expand within that subject.  My son had no problem finding some of the nickelodeon shows he likes to watch.Streaming was stutter free, no sync problems for audio/video.  Pictures were crisp and clear, although he was watching his cartoons and such, I haven't tried it on any higher quality movies and such yet.  But so far, for the price, it's been impressive.Remote works without any line of sight to the stick behind the TV so it's a wireless remote of some sort, not IR.  That's a benefit considering the placement.The USB charger wall wart is very small, and even fit between two other things on the power strip I've got it plugged into, so that's a nice design compared to most wall warts.It came pre-attached to my account, although it did offer to let me use a different account during setup.  I'm just glad I remembered the pin code I set ages ago, since that's what it needs, not any password.All told, for the half off price I paid, this was a total no brainer purchase.  It works well, other than the carousel annoyance of Amazon's interface, and the fact that you can just unplug it and take it somewhere else is a very good feature.For someone who has gone all this time without streaming (despite so many of my devices supporting it, like the Xboxes and Playstations and such) I'm beginning to see the value in it, when you're getting it for free as a side benefit to something you already bought.  If you have prime, and you have kids, it's worth far more than the pennies it ends up costing to purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JDThird \"John\""}]
