[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I was really excited to receive the Chromecast. Setup was a snap, but when I tried streaming, it just wouldn't work. Both YouTube and Netflix streaming to the Chromecast didn't work. I tried calling support, but the only troubleshooting suggestions were items I tied prior to calling support (reboots, setup again, try streaming from another device). Phone support put me in contact with email support,which was even worse. Turnaround time on email support was a couple days per email, with Q&A; already performed with phone support. Great idea, but poor execution. The rating is one star (great setup, streaming wouldn't work, poor support). I returned the Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome, awesome product that was well worth the wait.

Tabcasting, the feature I bought it for, doesn't work on iOS. Also thought I might be able to Tabcast streaming content from my PC. Nope! Creates way to much network traffic to work smoothly. Returned it and bought a Roku for $15 more to handle my streaming content. Much better solution.If all you do is watch YouTube videos, this is the solution for you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jason Johnson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing is great, it's slowly replacing my my Roku.

Installation is a breeze, simply connect it to your TV , connect your device such as an iPhone to to wi if signal sent off by the chromecast to enter your information, connect back to your home wifi network, and your ready to start using it. What's neat about e chromecast in a way is the fact that you aren't really \"streaming\" the content to your tv, what's really happening is say your watching a YouTube video, instead if streaming it to your tv, the chromecast receives the information such as the website name/URL etc and it quickly finds it online and starts to play the selected content. It works really quickly and I have no complaints on it. It would be really great though if you had the ability to share photos or videos stored in your device. Maybe in the future in some automatic updates google can incorporate this into the chromecast. Right now it doesn't really offer much, but for the relatively low price point you can't really complain, you can only enjoy what is possible at the moment.I rate this product 4 stars out of 5 stars!I hope this review has helped you out!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eduardo Placido"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "One of the few electronic gadgets that is really useful and  is truly simple to install and set up.
