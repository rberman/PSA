The setup was simple and we have been enjoying the movies and games.  I like the voice search, but I wished it would work on the other movie apps like Netflix not just the Amazon Prime.  Eventually I am going to be building my own home media center and this will make a great addition.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "neteng"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This unit has a bug that used most of my gigabits of data for this month.

(Because of this, I wouldn't trade my roku or Apple tv for the Amazon fire TV)  But I actually was most excited to play games on it. My problem is that this thing doesn't have any memory! I can install 1-2 games at most. So I ordered a memory stick (it has a slot for it in the back) and although the memory stick fits in it, it doesn't give me any memory. Very frustrated by this. Unless I'm doin something wrong. Can anyone help me?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amanda"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Quick and simple set up. The remote works well, but it does not recognize my voice. No big deal but it should work since it was an advertised feature. I was NOT able to find a game controller in a store. Again no big deal, but if you're gonna tout the gaming features you should ensure the availability of controllers in store not just online. It is very fast when browsing and connecting to a selection. Overall I would recommend this unit.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gene brennan"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was pretty disappointed to find that there are not many good apps for the Fire TV, at least not yet. In addition, while I have HBOGo and ShowtimeAnytime on my Kindle Fire HD, when I added them to the Fire TV they did not list my service provider (Charter) so I can't use them.
