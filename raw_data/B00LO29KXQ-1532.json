[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very happy with the out come of the Fire TV Stick.  I would recommend it to friends and family.  I do however RECOMMEND that Amazon get their shipping up to par.  I was not impressed with the supposedly 2 day shipping of my order,  instead it took 4 days. This is when I also ordered prime for a 30 day trial.  Other than that I give Amazon 4 STARS!!!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "T-REX"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have been using it for a couple of months now.
