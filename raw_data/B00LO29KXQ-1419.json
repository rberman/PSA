[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I tried so, so hard to like the Fire TV stick, and when it worked it worked excellently - lots of apps, quick menus, good quality video ...BUT ...The wifi performance on this device is TERRIBLE.  I've tried lots of tips/tricks to try to help it, with none having ay impact.  It's kind of a mood killer when you're trying to watch a show, only to have it suddenly stop, buffer forever, then say that it can't play back at this time and you have to physically reboot the Stick to get it to start again.  Some days I never have to do this, other days it's every 15 minutes, and some days programs won't load at all.This might be a device-by-device hardware flaw, sine a lot of people seem to be able to use their Stick without any issues.  All I know is the one I have is pretty much unusable and I'm not the only one who has these issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Craig Jacobson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.

It's easy to setup and the remote control works like a charm.  I had recently purchased a chrome cast but found out I was not able to use it with Hotel's WiFi ,  the Amazon fire stick allows you to use the hotel's wifi without any problem .  Unlike the chrome cast you don't even have to use your phone or mobile device ,  this is an awesome device worth every penny.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ramses A Perez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very slick.

That's was the primary reason for my purchase.  And this has EXCEEDED my expectations!  I though, eh, $39, it's worth a shot.  And worth it this is!I was using my blue ray player to stream Netflix and it was sub-par, I was forced to purchase a new device because the manufacturer was removing that feature.  I am SO glad they did.  :)I might even purchase another Fire stick for my other room, even though the Stick is portable, I can just plug it into my other tv.  It's wireless, it's made to live freeIn the box you get the Fire stick and a power cord.  You must use the power cord because the Fire stick does not get enough power through just the HDMI port.I will definitely buy another!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rose"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is better for our TV and needs than Chrome Cast was.
