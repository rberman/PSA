The first night I could get Amazon prime to load quickly nothing else would. Since I no longer have prime I didn't watch anything but noticed how rapidly it loaded compared to Netflix. Hmm....interesting.I could never get Netflix or anything else to work, even though my internet connection was fine on my computer and phone.  Tonight I was able to go to Netflix and tune in radio but could not even watch or listen to one program due to the constant buffering. I can watch Netflix on my computer with no buffering so it's not a WiFi issue on my end. This stick is crap and I'm returning it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "avid reader"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Super great for Prime members. HBO collection alone is worth it. Only problem is a green flicker that occurs every couple minutes. Makes it unwatchable. Have to turn everything off and then back on, only to have the green flicker return after a couple minutes. After a little research, find a work around by turning off \"pixel orbiter\" on my Panasonic ST50 tv. Have not had the problem since, at the expense of rising plasma \"burn in\" with pixel orbiter turned off.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "bynum1420"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Solid product but no internet browser.  you are locked in with whatever shows (netflix, hulu etc)/apps available.

I like it better than Chromecast. I like the little remote and that there is an app. This is amazing. SO awesome. Use this to watch TV in one room of the house, we use XBOX one in the other. The Fire Stick is much easier to use for hulu/netflix/prime etc than xbox. I love the ease of the remote.

Works so much quicker than my Roku Stick! Better remote, menu and everything else. Much quicker processing time, less buffering.

Its easy to use, walks you through step by step how to set it up. Its small and hides perfectly  behind my tv. The only issue I have is with the remote. Not sure if its the batteries or something but it has a mind of its own. I got to press on letter and it types it 5 times, or I click to go to the next letter and it skips over it. So instead of taking 30 seconds to search a title it takes like 5 minutes between hitting the backspace and re-clicking the correct letters.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Monica"}]
