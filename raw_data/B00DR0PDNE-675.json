Buy Chromecast once and then I can watch anything on my computer on my tv.  It is easy to install and use.  Takes me about 5 minutes, or my 11 year old can do it in less. I have it attached to every TV.  We don't need to have expensive home television service.  We have netflix, youtube, and other inexpensive and easily monitored options.  Love it!  There is a limit of three that a person can buy at a time.
