I hope theres also a better general streaming option for videos on the desktop.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "EASY"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "arletty"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great little invention...love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
