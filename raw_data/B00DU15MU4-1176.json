The device works but could be a lot better. When you search with the voice remote (the big sales point from Amazon) it prefers the paid content from their site even when you have the same content in Hulu Plus, or Netflix (Both applications are running and active)so why does the device tells me to pay to buy it from them if I can see it on the other applications? (to make money). Now if the content is not on Amazon store it will find content from Hulu but not Netflix. I tried to look in the settings to see if I can change how the device priorities it search criteria but not luck. Over all I like it and I like the idea of what it could do. I just think that Amazon should work on fixing this issue and they would have better ratings. (I would change my rating to 5 starts if they fix it)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Javier V."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazon Fire TV is fantastic.
