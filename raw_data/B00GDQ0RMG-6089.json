The performance is great it's fast at downloading and installing apps, opening up apps, and just using.  My only complaint is the remote.  The remote the Fire TV Stick ships with is cheap.  It is plastic and has a terrible feel. I purchased the upgraded remote and now love everything about my Fire TV Stick setup.  I highly recommend this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael S"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just hooked it up and it works flawlessly.  Liked the fact that it was already registered to me as I am a Prime member.  Had fun watching video's and downloaded the FIT exercise video; sure looked as it could be a good workout.Have not tried any games yet.  Like it very much cant wait to use more.I already own the Sony internet, the Apple TV, and now the Amazon Fire Stick.Honestly, can't tell the difference except that the Amazon does not have Apple apps and the Apple of course does not allow Amazon Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Greg"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I am disappointed in the Firesrick performance. Over the three days I used it, I experienced several start uo problems. Problems included: long startup time,  failed startups and lockups. The lockups could only be cured by unplugging and repluging the unit.I decided to try the Firestick to see if I could replace my ROKU box for video streaming. I have been a long ROKU user, but never liked its quirky performance. I am sorry to say that it seems that Firestick brings its own set of quirks.I plan to return the Firestick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Kenneth P.

It works great and was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my husband.  However, he opened it up on Monday when it came and I have now lost him to the TV!

I have a Chromecast for viewing Netflix and Youtube, and use a PS3 for Amazon Prime and a few other streaming apps. Fire TV Stick does almost everything both of those do, plus more. I definitely see my family using this often.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "JayneCobb"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was fairly quick and easy for set up. The streaming with the Fire Stick seemed to be a lot smoother with less 'hick-ups'. Easy navigation with the remote. I replaced my Boxee Box with this as I;m a Prime member and the Boxee didn't have the Amazon Prime ap. The cost for the Fire Stick was great too. I also have a Roku that works well in the other room that get's me to Prime, but I sure like the small size of the Firestick and it's wireless hookup.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lynn Wilson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Picked this up at best buy for $24 yesterday.
