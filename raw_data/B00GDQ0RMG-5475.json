Plug and play by sticking the device into an available HDMI port. Great picture and sound. Setup is a breeze.Requires external power though. The device will pester you to use the included  USB power adapter (so it can download your shows preemptively) but I prefer drawing the external power from the USB port on my TV, to save on valuable power outlets around my TV center. So I run the micro USB cord from the device into the neighboring USB port.The remote feels somewhat cheap and the click wheel is noisy. This may fade as the remote is \"broke in\".Overall, 5/5.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A. Deskins \"WVBullrider\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great. Lots of fun apps.
