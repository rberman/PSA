I was able to purchase it for $19.99 during the intro time.  However, I am probably about to buy another one!  It's so easy to install and use.  You do not have to be a computer/techno genius.  Easy to move from room to room, if needed.  We personally use it for Netflix and Amazon Prime shows and movies.  I highly recommend this product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JWolaver \"booksaremyzen\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This has been great for hotels!

I was concerned at first that it wouldn't be fast, or that it would have issues (mainly because of the very reasonable price) but I was wrong-- no issues at all.  Very good picture, downloads quick.
