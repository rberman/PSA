I plug it in to the HDMI Out port of my Logitech Google TV. Works great when streaming from my laptop for Amazon Prime and the paid Hulu service. It doesn't work so well when trying to stream from my Droid X2. Hulu says their app works on Android but even after contacting Hulu support they have not provided a solution, only promises (at the time of this writing it's been over a month since requesting support from Hulu. I'm not holding my breath).We often watch TV in the bed room which, for me it's inconvenient to carry my laptop back and forth, so it would be nicer if I could stream everything from my smart phone rather than the laptop.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Leonard Parker"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jerrod"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It's so easy and helpful, but the applications which works with it, not enough", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Majed"}]
