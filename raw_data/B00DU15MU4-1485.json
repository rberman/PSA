[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works as advertised but has a difficult time buffering over wifi connection.  Also the network settings are very basic, and limiting making it difficult to diagnose internet connection issues.  For example, after you connect to your wifi, the network status will either indicate \"connected\", \"connected with problems\" or \"not connected\" but it does not allow user to review the connection settings.  All you can do is disconnect and try to reconnect.  Very frustrating.  Works great over a direct wired connection, of course.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jenny C"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I was not a fan of the Fire Tv...I couldnt get the stations and apps that i am use to getting on my Roku.

I also own an apple tv and I must say when I was setting up the amazon fire tv, I was deeply impressed with the unique feats it possesses! For example, the remote has a mic where you can tell the device what you are looking for. I was in a separate room and spoke in the mic. The amazon fire tv pulled up the show in my kid's playroom with no problems. The navigation is easy and the style is there. Though the apple tv has it's respective feats as well as convenience to apple users; I must admit the amazon fire tv poses to be a formidable device in the category of online tv streaming devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "LEXINGTON"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Simply a must have for movie and tv watchers, the device will only get better with time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carlos R.
