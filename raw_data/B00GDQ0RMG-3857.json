All my movies have an a screen over all content that gives only sound and a blue screen. There is no number to call for help. Save your money and go google or roku because this product is the biggest joke and the joke WILL be on you.I have since gotten an e mail from Amazon stating they would work to make it work. Nice and I placed the unit on another TV and all is working fine. Apparently you have to put it directly on a hdmi port on the TV. If it runs through another cable you get the unarthorised user blue screen.  It is working fine at this time and like the ability to get Amazon music through it. The trouble I had earlier is the only reason for the 4 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DAVE'SCAVE"}]
