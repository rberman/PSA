This device requires that you adapt to it and not the other way.

It lets you use your cell phone as a remote to enable the deployment of broadcasts from your cell phone to your TV. Trouble is, it's incredibly clunky to use when it works at all, and has such limited support (Netflix, Youtube, and Plex) as to be only marginally useful. Pony up another $40, and you can get Roku, which is what Chromecast should aspire to. My Chromecast laster 6 months before it stopped functioning. Rather than replace it, I bought a Roku 3.

I had it up and running and connected to my Note 3 within 5 minutes.The next time I went to use it my phone wouldn't see it. I reset my entire network (router and modem), TV, disconnected and reconnected the device from power and the TV. After powering back on, my TV screen showed that it need to be set up again. On my phone, the ChromeCast app saw the device as already set up. No apps on my phone would recognize ChromeCast. I couldn't do anything at this point.A few days later I decided I had time to work with it more so I turn my TV to the correct input and it's working fine. I watched HULU for several hours that day.Then today, I go back and it's not working again. I pulled the power, reset my phone, and reset my network.... nothing.Very flaky.
