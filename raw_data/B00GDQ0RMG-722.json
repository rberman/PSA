I spent lots of time on the phone with South Africa and even more time on the phone with the fine people in the Philippines.  Unfortunately they didn't seem to understand the term \"Aspect Ratio.\"  They had no answers with regard to billing and they couldn't seem to provide any answers about the Wi-Fi password.  I had been put on hold for about 25 minutes by a supervisor before I was conveniently disconnected.  I won\u2019t say hung up on but we\u2019ll just keep it at disconnected.  I did get really familiar with the piano hold music.  After I called back, another one of the fine Customer Service / Support representative asked me to check one of the settings in the Amazon Fire Stick Menus but when I came back to the phone they were also gone, disconnected again.  The lady in South Africa was nice, she said she\u2019d check on the Aspect Ratio issue and give me a call back but that was two days ago and I haven\u2019t heard back from her.  I kind of feel like if Amazon is going to manufacture products and they are going to have support for said products, perhaps they should at least show the customer service representatives the products and let them know how they work.  I also noticed there isn\u2019t much content unless you sign up for \u201cPrime\u201d or add other services like Netflix.  Overall this was not a good customer experience.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S. Graves"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's works but not smoothly as I would like.

I have since bought 2 others.  I use them to stream from Amazon Prime, NetFlix and Hulu, as well as from my Plex Media Server.

I mostly use my Fire TV Stick to watch netflix and can usually get through a movie or tv show with minimum buffering.  Hulu has major buffering issues during the ads, but the shows themselves using stream well.  I love the remote that came with the FTVS - it's simple and intuitive.I imagine that even when I do manage to get a better internet, I would still use FTVS more often than my Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alysha Terry"}]
