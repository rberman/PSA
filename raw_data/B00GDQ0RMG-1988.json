We have Chromecast and very much enjoyed how easy it was to use, but it has a major problem, it drops out about every 15 min  or so and  rebuffers then starts playing again  losing 10 to 15 second of the show and never fails as at the most interesting part.  We have a strong WiFi signal and we talk to others who have it and they experience the same with Chromecast. We do not have this issue with the Fire TV Stick, remote easy to use only weak part is the Tablet App, remote that sucks, but like Chromecast  it give you the options in other Apps like youtube to throw to you TV so from that aspect it works the same.We have completely stopped using Chromecast as the Fire TV Stick offers much more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JLB-Fishers"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Johnny Ariel Cortes Soto"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I can not watch Netflix without a game counsel.
