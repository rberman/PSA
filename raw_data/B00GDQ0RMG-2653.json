We've cut cable.  Very, very easy to install and set up in just a few minutes. Like the remote. The voice search via the iPhone or iPad  works like a charm. Connecting mostly so far with Netflix and Amazon Prime TV but also can connect to Hulu plus, Sling and more.  Loading is sufficiently fast and streaming goes well without interruptions for buffering.
