I also have the fire phone so it syncs everything from my phone except the apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it... but I got it for the $28 sale going on initially.  Wish I got more for that price.  if I was going to spend $50 for a new one.. I would just consider the bigger Fire TV.. with the better remote.All in all... great product.  Just wish more apps worked with it.  Time will tell I guess.  I was hoping the Slingblade app would let my DISH programing come to the TV, but sadly DISH is not supported.  They want you to get a Joey I guess.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Neofactor"}]
