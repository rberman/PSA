Moved it to a different TV closer to the router, and after working for like a week it won't even turn on anymore. Try to turn it on and the TV shows that the input is active but the screen just turns black. Glad I paid the $19 for it, because I doubt I will ever get even that back from Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joshua Boehm"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gabriel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product.

Seems like it overheats on occasion. I had to send it back for a replacement already due to this. Have had some minor issue with the replacement but not as bad.
