[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is without a doubt one of the best presents I've ever given. It took a little longer to setup than initially suggested, but that could be due to the internet at the location where I was setting it up. If you're looking to stream downloaded content, this isn't the product for you, but if you want to zip content from your computer or phone to the tv that is online, this is a GREAT inexpensive alternative to a roku or an apple tv. All around phenomenal experience, and the picture quality is amazing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Evan Rochkind"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I am borrowing this from my Mom to see if I actually want to purchase one, which I don't.Pros: easy to plug in (if you only use audio directly from your TV's speakers)Cons: took 30 mins if finagling to make it work with an Onkyo receiver, lose your ability to control the Cast if your Kindle Fire screen goes to sleepThis is meant to literally plug into your HD TV.  If you have a receiver set up with your audio routing through it, you'll have to change the settings on your TV to broadcast audio via the built-in speakers every time you want to use Cast something.The other option I came up with (no thanks to the instructions) was to plug it into an HDMI in on my Onkyo receiver.  For some reason it confused my receiver, and relabeled the inputs that were already set up???  I had to manually go through the set up sequence again telling my receiver which device was where.We were planning to get this up and ready by the time Walking Dead and Game of Thrones began streaming on their respective websites, but I don't know that it's worth the bother.  When I tested by Casting Pandora via my Kindle Fire, I would lose control of the Cast every time the screen went to sleep.  If it turned it back on and opened Pandora again, there was nothing going on.  The Cast continued on my TV, leaving me unable to thumbs up/down or skip anything.  Pandora would start playing something different through the Kindle speakers!To be fair, it seems to Cast well enough via my Galaxy Nexus using the Chromecast app, but that'll be super fun navigating the HBO website on that tiny screen looking for episodes to stream...", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Laurennn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the chromecast.
