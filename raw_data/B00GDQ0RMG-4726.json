I watch mostly amazon prime, netflix, (and hulu when I'm desperate, I hate commercials!), so this little gadget is perfect for me.  I have a Roku downstairs on our main TV and the Fire Stick is upstairs in my bedroom.  My router is at the opposite end of my house and downstairs but I have no buffering issues at all.  I'm very pleased with the fire stick and the price is perfect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "K. Murphy"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "EXCELLENT! I would give this a full 5 stars if there weren't occasional buffering problems in Netflix. My wifi is plenty speedy enough - I think there might be something internal going on with the stick, since it feels like Amazon's own entertainment selections buffer without a hitch, but Netflix is the culprit for buffering hiccups. These are not very long, just a few seconds, but when it happens 4-5 times within a couple minutes, it can be annoying when it happens.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AndrewOrbit"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Did not perform well.  constantly lost wifi signal, apps would freeze. videos would always buffer and stutter.  Other devices on the network including a chromecast all play video better than the Fire TV.  Returned it after 1 month.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/5", "author": "tim"}]
