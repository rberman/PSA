The video tutorial you are forced to watch and can\u2019t get rid of is super annoying however; it would be better if it were optional as all it did was waste my time and frustrate me.Despite the fact that my N900 wireless router is a mere 19 feet away from the stick, it receives a very weak signal.  Every other device I own gets a good, much stronger signal from the basement, attic, back yard and the street in front of my house.I updated the android operating system on my Samsung Galaxy phone so that I could mirror to the stick.  The stick and my phone find each other and connect easily.  The problem is, they won\u2019t stay connected, and as soon as I start to watch something, the stick disconnects from my phone. (one star down)I installed Miracast on my laptop, and it won\u2019t connect to the stick.  (another star down)I picked up a Chromecast from a local retailer.  It was easier to set up, has a better connection and casted with no difficulty.You'll need to try again Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Wild Celtic Rose"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i love being able to watch my prime movies and such on the regular tv screen.  works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "cassie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hopeful \"RMW\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Definitely enjoying it, and yes it's helping me to make the decision to get rid of cable easier.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "terry legrande"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great item, so many apps to choose from.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jennie rider"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The fire stick came very quickly and it contained everything I needed to connect my tv to hulu and netflix.
