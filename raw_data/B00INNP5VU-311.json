It has extra channels that Chromecast will not use.  I get PBS (for Downton Abbey, Amazon Prime, Netflix.  Those are my biggest users.  It also features \"M-Go\", a movie channel you can buy movies from.  What sets this one apart from the rest (Vudu, etc.) is that it awards points for either buying or renting movies through them. About every fourth movie, you can redeem your points and rent for free. It is very cool.  Their customer service is also great and very responsive.The only trouble I have encountered is two things: 1. the first Roku remote stopped working so I got a new Roku. 2. I cannot sync my iPhone Roku app to use it as a remote.  If I figure that out, it should be good to go from there.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JR \"daddy0\""}]
