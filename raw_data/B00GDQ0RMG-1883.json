Can't even watch anything while I am a Prime member. It recognizes me because my name is on there and all pictures from my phone were automatically on there but when I want to watch something it's blocked and it tells me to become a prime member.Installing YouTube is not for free and I would have wanted to install an app to be able to watch Dutch television and that's not even possible either.

(The cartoon guy during set up was a nice touch Amazon programmers)Our WiFi base is upstairs and at the far end of the house and the Fire TV reception is \"almost\" flawless.during a one hour episode of \"Game of Thrones\" the system had a two second freeze up,  and that was it.so that's not even worth reporting, but anyone who uses this kind of tech should be realistic and realize that NOTHING is perfect.This device is not for everyone, but I have to give it my highest praise and recommend Fire TV Stick to anyone interested.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jason H"}]
