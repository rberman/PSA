Many people said that they could not connect to their internet router. Plugged everything in per the instructions and got to the point where you choose your internet and it froze up. Not knowing what to do, I unplugged the fire stick from the TV and plugged it in again. Presto, it had all the available networks including mine. Chose my internet connection and it worked perfectly after that. I have a Samsung TV with three HDMI connections and one was being used so just connected it to the number two slot. Pretty easy to get things going. I am sure that others had the problems they described, but I didn't experience any. Not sure if that was because it was the latest version of fire stick, or maybe the TV, but everything is working and it is great to watch some of the old Syfy movies I enjoyed as a kid. I think that if you get the latest version of fire stick and have a fairly new TV (mine is five years old), you shouldn't have any problems.

My only complaints are that you have to plug the stick into the tv and then there is a cord that attaches from the stick to an electrical outlet. It's very misleading because the visuals do not show you plugging it into electric...so if you have wall mounted your tv, you will have to feed the cord thru the wall or leave it hanging. Secondly, like every technical device, the stick will freeze on an app occasionally and needs to be rebooted by unplugging and plugging back in. I have a roku 1 as well on another television and have never experienced it freezing up.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jenst"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Overall a good value.  I've used the Fire TV Stick almost exclusively for streaming video and music.Pros:  responsive and intuitive interface, lots of content, apps such as Pandora are easy to navigate, the remote control is simple and works well, smartphone Fire TV app adds voice search which works quite wellCons:  I have a good 802.11n wifi connection but still get stutter streaming videos and even occasional stutter listening to music.  It's not a deal breaker but enough to be noticeable and keeps it from being a 5 star product.  Perhaps a firmware update could address the stutter.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "waltcoleman"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "How do I review something that didn't work? I gave it 2 stars because I don't hate it and, based on the reviews, it works for a lot of people. Our wifi is one room over and we couldn't get a signal.
