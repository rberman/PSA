It started out great, but now the remote has had some errors.  The remote app works perfectly,so the issue is in the remote.  I will contact Amazon about this and will report back.Amazon sent me a new remote, same issue.  Randomly, if you press a button it will scroll infinitely in that direction.  It is super annoying.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David P.

However when I down-load a long movie, it cuts to a blank screen towards the end.  If I unplug it for awhile, it comes back on, which is very annoying.  Also I bought the voice command which is wonderful, however the other remote, that was shipped with the Fire TV Stick failed to work.  So in review, I got one bad remote, one firestick that works for awhile then blanks out, a voice control which is great and worth the money, and I would have to say, that had I had not bought the voice control too, it would never have gotten off the starting line.  I think the firestick is (heat sensitive) and that needs to be corrected, unless mine is just bad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Russell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "first this is not  chromecast which primary for sending video or screen display from a tablet pc or phone. fire stick is a stand alone device that plays games. the android fire control app has voice search fuction. does require a good wireless  connection the stick will output 5.1 dd + for show that send it. the fire stick outputs rgbvideo levels you may have to select rgb lower or 0 on your hdtv for correct black levels it also supports the fire game controller which is needed for most games some can be played with the remote only downside lack of storage maybe ver 2 could come with 16g or micro sd slot", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "robert bush"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic!!

I not only own a stick but also other fire TV units. They are all extremely easy to use. The sticks are way easier to take places and move TV to TV when needed. The remote is easy to use, but you do need a tiny bit of adjustment time.A tiny hack that I found to help alot - I downloaded the App which you can use to type in things like your email. The voice search is nice but using the app seems to be quicker for me. Otherwise I just sit and scream at the TV. Comical for others but not very useful.But overall this is way better then the Chrome Sticks  (I owe one of those too).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Pretty happy overall. Set up was fast and easy. No problems at all. Really like the interface for most services.Only complaints are - No HBO! That's a biggie. And, though I love the sleek design of the remote, the up/down/left/right buttons are so unbelievably touchy that it makes the remote almost unusable! This isn't just me, it's everyone at my house who has tried to use the remote.If you try to move one click in any direction, it will sometimes scroll four or five or more items before stopping. Then trying to go back and it will do the same thing in the other direction. My son and I both have android phones and have installed the ap, which works fine. But my wife doesn't have an android and is relegated to using the supplied remote. This has resulted in the utterance of more than a few colorful words and comments.To summarize: Overall quite happy, especially for the price. But - add HBO Go! And fix the bloody remote!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Certainly has a nice interface, especially if you're a Prime member.  But it fails on the \"portability\" thing.  Can't use it in places, such as a hotel, where a wifi authentication is required.  Also, be prepared to carry the power adapter with you just in case. I haven't found an HDMI outlet yet that provides enough power to make the device happy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mtipper \"mtipper\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I had high hopes for this product.  It would give me more options that Chrome Cast . Fire Stick ran great for about one day and I really liked it.  On day two it would stop streaming.  It told me I was \"connected with problems\".  None of my other devices that uses the wifi network had any issues.  I would re-boot (unplug/re-plug) the stick and it would again work. It does it several times a day now.  From reading other post, this seems to be a big issue.  I am going to put it back in the box and go back to Chrome Cast.  Maybe an update or gen2 will be better.
