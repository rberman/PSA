I have an older Roku Box on my family room TV and this Roku Stick on my bedroom TV.  I like them both.  I'm really enjoying getting Amazon Prime Videos and HuluPlus.  It came with 3 months free of HuluPlus!  It also has Netflix and so many other options.  The remote takes a little getting used to but so far it's fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chesapeake"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Best yet, better than Chromecast by far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William T."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "excellent iteam", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "tareq alawneh"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works as expected.

There are no cords and the remote doesn't necessitate line of sight because it doesn't utilize infrared.
