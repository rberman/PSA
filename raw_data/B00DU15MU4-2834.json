[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This little baby is the most fabulous innovation by Amazon I have ever come across.  I think that 90% of the junk on TV is JUNK! This tiny box brings me my choice of great movies (Prime, of course) and the few good programs of TV and I can see them all through my TV.  I can even scan through all the photos on my iPad as well as any TV episodes I have downloaded. Thank you, Amazon. My favorite place to shop!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dorothy Lesher"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wow! Once again, Amazon really knocks my socks off. Until 2011, I thought Amazon was just another E-tail business. What made the difference for us was Kindle. My wife wanted a Kindle mainly for her long commutes. We just read paper stuff back then. I immediately followed hers with my first Kindle that year. Now, I also have a Kindle Fire HD, and I don\u2019t know how I ever lived without it.But fast-forward to Kindle Fire TV: I sort of understood what we could do with it, but when I connected it (easy!) and fired it up, wow. Like the Kindles, it solved a lot of problems I didn\u2019t know I had; like how to see the kinds of movies and TV shows we like, instead of the stock noise and car crashes and ogres and aimless sex clone shows being spewed out today. Now my wife can get a Jane Austen classic with a voice command! I can get Maigret on the tube with little more than a grunt.Setup was fantastically easy. We attached the Fire TV to a Samsung 47\u201d TV that has Time Warner Cable usually running on it. It has two HDMI ports. All I had to do was to plug in the Fire TV, plug the HDMI cable to the second HDMI port, turn on the TV with the Samsung remote, chose the second port, and sit back and peep out show after show of exactly what we wanted to see, rather than clones of clones of shows with only the names changed. Once again, Amazin\u2019 Amazon demonstrated its technological finesse and careful design and follow-through with a wonderful, easy to use product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chitwah \"Stanjbass\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am not an avid TV viewer.

Use it every day.....had a problem. requested a call via the TV and was called within SECONDS!  Spoke with a HUMAN who was very helpful and had us back up and running very quickly.

App would be easier though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "constantine"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Great performance but it's only prepared to waste money on Amazon content. There's a lot of apps to be added yet.You cannot control TV volume through HDMI-CEC, Netflix app is an old one.It seems to be very powerful in HW specs and User Interface experience ... but its software don't let it to be as promised.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Juan Luna"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was so easy to set up.
