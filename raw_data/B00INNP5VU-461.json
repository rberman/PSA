[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have two of these now. That's how much I like them. I recently canceled my TV service (via satellite) because it was getting just too darned expensive. With the Roku stick I have access to every show I would have watched via satellite. Some are free, and some are via a service that requires a monthly or annual payment. It's still much cheaper than what I paid for my satellite service. I also have a Chromecast device, which is good, but not as good as the Roku, imho. With the Roku you don't need a phone or tablet to control the device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sue Eckhardt"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love this stick.
