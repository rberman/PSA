[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I bought this device for two reasons, to be able to \"project\" from my Windows laptop, and because it was such a great value. As a streaming device it's a great value. The fact that it comes with a remote is great. I have used the following apps and found them all to work well: Hulu Plus, Smithsonian, Amazons Weather app. The PBS app did not work quite right (the main panel displayed a message to register Fire TV, but the video clips below that message played videos fine).I will keep the device in the hope that Amazon Develops support for Miracast that actually works from Windows laptops (Miracast is supposed to be a device independent standard). As a Netflix / Hulu player, it is great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "T J Watson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really like the fire tv stick installation is a wiz easy to view and control I highly recommend", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lillian Ochoa"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Unplugged it from my tv and it damaged my HDMI port on my 55\" TV.

I had a Chromecast, but my Amazon Fire TV Stick is like a Chromecast on steroids!I could never play my purchased Amazon songs on the Chromecast...But, now...I can play everything on my Amazon music, on my Fire TV Stick .Plus, its so much easier to do all selections of movies, tv, music, pictures, etc...right on tv screen with either the Fire TV Stick app or the included remote control :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Colleen R Hand"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "This would be great if it actually worked!
