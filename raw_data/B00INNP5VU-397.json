We had bought Amazon Prime as one of our Christmas presents to ourselves, so this works out perfectly! The price was really nice too! And setup is a breeze! Plus there are so many new movies and tv shows to watch, sometimes it hard to decide just which ones to watch! We're pleasantly surprised that some episodes on Amazon Prime are now continuous streaming, which is even more convenient!
