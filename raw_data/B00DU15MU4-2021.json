[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a wonderful piece of equipment that is very easy to set up and works beautifully. The organization of content from movies to TV shows is very helpful and provides access to a large number of shows I frankly did not know existed or was never able to watch. The suggestions offered by the system for shows I might be interested in seem very much on target. All in all it is a marvelous device that makes cable service seem so behind the times. The one problem is that with Amazon Prime you often spend too much time checking out a movie before being told it will cost extra rather than being free of charge with Prime. The cost should be listed with the name of the movie on the first page listing available content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Warren Buhler"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is a very good product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "directioner 101"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "locks up and freezes too often,till that issue is fixed i would not buy another one thank you", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far so good!
