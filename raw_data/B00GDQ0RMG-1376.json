I can stop using my Wii for TV.I can also easily move the firestick from one TV to another. This is especially helpful when I'm in my camper and TV reception is poor. I just fire up my wireless access point and plug in the firestick.  Game on!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephen Chott"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE.
