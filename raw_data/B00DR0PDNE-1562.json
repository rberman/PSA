At one point I was reluctant to make the purchase, however, I followed my instinct based on Amazon purchases in the past.  This device works fine for my application.  It was up and running within a few minutes.  Within 10 minutes we were watching Netflix and more.  I did make a commitment to speed up my internet service to help with buffering, but even without the speed adjustment it worked fine.  All 5's here in Houston.  By the way, I purchased the HDMI cable but haven't needed it.  It works great as a remote unit.m", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works perfectly, just wish it was cross platform compatible.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "PeddalAround"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Exelente", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "rafael flores"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "WOW ..

I've had it loose its memory of my wireless a few times..maybe it upgraded itself and caused it?  This plays formats that my VIZIO TV will not by its own internal software (DLNA interface stuff).  Dont expect it to work far away from the wireless router unless you buy an extension to get the KEY up and out in the open are with a clearer shot to the source.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert T.
