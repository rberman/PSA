Works great for its purpose. Be careful to only use on password protected wifi networks though.

I just plugged it into the HDMI port on my TV and it found it straight away. Had to update the software on it to the latest version, but once that was done, watching youtube videos and personal photos on my TV was just so easy. Just wonder why I didn't get it a year ago when they came out....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Xciting Trips"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I'm highly disappointed with this device.Setup was easy enough; however, when I'm looking at a video on  my computer that is streaming beautifully, as soon as I cast the video to my HDTV, it starts dropping multiple frames, enough so that the image is jumpy and appears out of sync with audio since the audio is still going while the picture is momentarily still and the when it moves again, it's usually out of sync. The frame drop then occurs on both my computer and the TV set.I am using a high speed, broadband Wifi router and, for the test, the separation between the Wifi router and the TV is about 6 feet.Highly disappointed and would not recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "J.
