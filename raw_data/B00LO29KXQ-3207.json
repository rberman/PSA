The fire stick is super responsive in terms of moving thru the menu. This device does however lag way more than my roku or my smart blu ray player. Not sure what the deal is, but when it streams hulu or netflix, it buffers constantly. Amazon videos seem to play fine tho", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Calvin Brown"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It cuts out and freezes up.
