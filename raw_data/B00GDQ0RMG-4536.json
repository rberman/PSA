We had to add another WiFi adapter to our TV, because it was too far from the family room for the WiFi signal to reach the TV.  Previously, our Smart TV was \"hard wired\" to our ISP box, but the Fire TV Stick requires a cordless WiFi connection.  We tried a WiFi extender, but it wasn't strong enough.  Also, when we originally purchased the subscription, the movies we were interested in through AMAZON showed $0.00 as the cost.  After we subscribed, we went to choose those same movies, and they were no longer \"free\".  Additionally, my husband has typical \"man's hands\" and the buttons on the controller are small, resulting in entry problems, so, I just ordered and received on Sunday, the Fire TV Stick with voice recognition.  We haven't tried it yet.  Quite frankly, we should have stayed with NETFLIX (which we still have), and not bothered with the Fire TV.  Also, our Cable provider has video on demand, and the cost for \"brand new\" movies is comparable to the cost of the AMAZON movies, when they finally offer them.  Not so sure if I will renew or not next year - we received the whole package as a gift, which included the new Kindle Fire (that is another disappointment, since everything you are interested in also costs a fee).  AMAZON, I hope you read this review and do your homework - I saved the e-mails with the $0.00 movie offers.  Good luck, hope they post this review - do your homework.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Louise B Louguet"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!

I cannot figure out how to get the videos I want to see onto my TV with this application. Videos from the internet \u2014\u00a0there seems to be no way to stream them onto the TV, and the help documents included in Fire TV Stick are pathetic.It also has some serious problems with wifi. I have an excellent, top-rated router and all my devices have perfect wifi at home now, except for this stupid Fire TV stick, which says it\u2019s not connected to wifi \u2014 when trying to watch something, that is. Go to the Wifi settings, and it says it \u201cis connected\u201d with \u201cvery good\u201d signal (and it should be \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s 10 feet away from my router). But no dice.There isn't even hardware restart option in the Fire TV stick menus. You have to know the secret combinations on the remote.Lastly, the iPhone app for fire TV is the worst app I can recall using in my entire life. It constantly forgets which device it\u2019s talking to, which is absurd as there is only one fire TV stick in my house or even on my block, as far as I can tell.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alan Hogan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "totally met my expectations, i love it woud most definately reccomend it to all of my friends and family!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nona"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was a breeze to set up...i did it in two minutes.
