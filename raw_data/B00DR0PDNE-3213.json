It was literally as easy as plugging it in and it worked- no difficulties.It does a great job streaming whatever is on my Chrome browser to my TV.I'd strongly recommend it to anyone remotely considering streaming TV options and for a 1 time payment of $35 it far exceeds the monthly streaming choices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mark T.

The HDMI extender included with the product helps with internet signal but the device can have signal issues if your TV's HDMI connection is located in an area of your TV that is covered by wires. This is an easy fix with a longer HDMI extension cord so that you can move the device to the top of the rear of the TV to gain better signal.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.M."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really smooth experience. Setup is quick and simple, and then the YouTube app on Android just works with it. Easy for multiple people to join in, adding things to the queue.

The only downside is that there are only a handful of apps that work with it.

It really bothers me with how hot this thing gets. Heat is the big killer of electronics and with as much extended use as this device is going to get I really worry that it is going to burn out.Lack of apps/lack of development kit at launch. I understand that Google is working with other sources on apps but there really needs to be a public development kit available so that other programs can get chromecast support.
