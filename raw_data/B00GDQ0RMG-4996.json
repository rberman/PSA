[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have Roku throughout the house, V2, V3 and the Roku stick as a reference. The comparison of the Roku stick and the Fire stick is really a one sided fight in my opinion. The Roku stick is slow and sluggish, whereas the Fire TV stick is very responsive. The menu structure is different, but so was the Roku interface when I first got it. Is one better than the other? That really is a personal choice. I prefer Amazons video quality and speed along with included games which is a bonus. The remote is clean and much thinner than the Roku stick. I do like the Roku in it's stand alone device format, but the Roku stick overheats and needs to be pulled from the HDMI often enough that I am mentioning it here. When the TV is wall mounted it makes it even more notable of an issue trying to get the Micro USB connector reconnected in a 1 1/2 in cavity.So far the Amazon Fire stick is everything I thought it would be, with one exception:The one lacking feature that I wish Fire TV had would be the Time Warner Cable app. That really is stopping me from converting over all my TV's to the Fire system, which I will once that becomes available.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.

I took a gamble on this over the chromecast because it had a remote ( I thought that would be a bonus over chromecast) However, I have since learned that it does not offer an app through your apple devices. It does work well... decent amount of apps (does not have crackle or disney movie digital copy). Occasionally freezes (not my internet because I have Netflix on my blue ray player and xbox 360 and they never freeze). I got it on sale for $25, so I can't complain... it makes a dumb tv smart for that little!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Doug"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ray"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great but you can't use it for YouTube.
