Really like the easy setup and screen format for the Fire TV. Prime  movies are readily available,and the number of related movie suggestions after watching a movie, is very helpful. Like that you can access photo's and play back round music as you watch them, from prime music. Access to movies is faster than Roku. Only thing I miss is the headphone jack on remote that Roku 3 had. I am well satisfied with the performance of the Fire TV .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "serens50"}]
