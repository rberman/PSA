I cannot believe the speed difference. I use Netflix and Prime and this stick is much faster than another type of box I used. Don't think twice, if you use netflix or prime get this!

As of last night when we installed the stick, we also dealt with the usb power problem, our chromecast was able to work using the usb port on the tv so we had to reconfigure plugs because it kept crashing due to not enough power I would assume. We then tried to watch a show on hulu and it constantly paused, we kept watching that episode on the fire stick but ultimately decided to switch to the roku to watch our next show.  This morning I tried to put on a show for the kids off of the watch list and when I hit play the screen goes black, like it is trying to load but cannot or something.Once all of the bugs get worked out the fire stick will be replacing the roku on our main tv, and we will also keep the chromecast for the cast a tab feature because as far as I can tell the fire stick does not have that. We really like the interface, just hope that the productivity improves!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Would be better if some of the apps worked with Time Warner Cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jim Zelenko"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have a Fire TV and now I have 3 Fire TV sticks.
