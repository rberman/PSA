[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have been using this for a few days now.  I really like its simplicity.  The UI is great.  Only downside is for best results you have to plug it in.  Unfortunately, I ran out of spots on my surge protector that my whole main system is on and so this has been relegated to the bedroom tv.  I love the Prime membership and the selection of content is really getting robust.  More to follow in a few.  -Cheers", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adam J.

It connected right in for me. This is extremely easy to install. The downloading of the update was really slow so I was afraid I couldn't stream well.  After done updating I streamed two different movies without any hesitation or skipping.  The one thing that annoys me and I called CS on is that I have to put pin in to let kids watch movies.  I can adjust what they watch but she said without my pin they can rent movies.  This doesn't make sense to me if I have on no purchases allowed without pin.  Hopefully it was wrong info on CS's part and someone here can chime in if they know differently. I did buy 2 controllers now so kids can play their favorite games.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dream4more(Carol)"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent choice, so simple to use. Performs as advertised, glad we made the purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robt. M"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is the real deal, especially when you use it with the first generation Google TVs, like the Sony NSX-46GT1 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BBCHJG).  You can finally have a real Amazon interface (much better than using the Chrome browser), and the TV remote control can be used to scroll through the Fire TV Stick.  It'll warn you about not having the remote control provided, but you can just ignore it for most of the applications (Amazon Video, Netflix, etc.).  You also get a Hulu interface, something I hadn't missed before.The Fire TV Stick is fast loading, especially with content we already bought through Amazon Video.I did get an error message using the the TV USB connections vs. connecting it straight to the power plug - but it still works, and I haven't seen any glitches from lack of power.  However, I haven't done much gaming on it, which may require more horsepower (thus more power).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dave"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The product is very useful, works as it should and great for the Prime price of $19.99 except for the set up.  Was extremely annoying to get past the \"Downloading\" phase.  Took us about 10 attempts and at least 8 times of rebooting/pulling the power cord as suggested!!!  Should have a bypass section for the Demo, but other than that great product!  I have all my access to Amazon Prime video, music and additional apps at a minimal price!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mai Cortes"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got my Fire TV Stick last night and it is awesome.

I have not used this function of the device yet, so will update my review when I have done that. But at this time here is what I think so far.Being an avid Roku user ( I have 7 of them at this time), I wanted to give the Fire TV stick a try and for the price I figured why not.Set up is simple, but did take a little long to update software right out of the box, no biggie but wanted to mention it.  I like the look of the remote and the simplicity of it. The only grip that I have is it comes already signed in to my amazon account right out of the box.I ordered 2 of these, one for myself and one as a gift for my dad, so no big deal, but if giving as a gift keep this in mind as others could order apps and movies from your account. Once the update goes through the interface and use of the Fire TV stick is very nice and easy.I use Plex more than anything with my Roku's, and you do have to purchase that app through the Amazon app store for the Fire TV, but for those that use amazon prime or purchase a lot of TV shows/Movies through amazon, this device is for you. The fire TV puts all that right there up front and easy to get to. All the other apps are easy to find and use as well. Overall picture quality is good, speed is good, and the more you use it, the better it gets.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "ryan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Simple and easy to use.  I love the size which makes it easy to travel with.  Setup was quick.  Just connect to a nearby WiFi network, wait while it updates the OS, and its ready to go.  The interface is just like the Fire TV, and the remote makes it easy to get watching videos quickly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The set-up was extremely simple. The \"Watch List\" feature is great. I can save movies to watch at a later time as I scroll through the offerings. I worried about the signal strength, since it operates via Wi-Fi, but it was great. The resolution was better than when I watch standard television programming. The movie quality was even better than I had hoped for. In the middle of severe thunderstorms that kept knocking out my satellite, the Fire TV Stick never wavered. I've only used it for a few days, so I hope that the performance stays at this level. If not, I will be back to update my review.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nae-Nae"}]
