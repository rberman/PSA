[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Like many others, I got the Fire Stick initially because the price was too good to pass up.  There are more in-depth and technical reviews out there, but let me just say that my non-techie family loves it.  It is easy for my wife to use, and she finds the interface very intuitive.  The Netflix app is speedier than others (such as the one 'built in' to our smart tv) and the aesthetic lay out is very nice.  One of our neighbors said \"Ooh, you have pretty Netflix\".  After playing with the Fire Stick, I have two relatives who were so impressed that they ordered their own.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "James Tyler Dancy"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Can't get it to work with our sound system", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Kindle Customer \"avid reader\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i lovr this thing", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "adam hoban"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent picture quality and speed.

I got it on the 20-buck introductory sale, and it's a great deal for that price. At the 40-buck current price, well, I'd probably choose a Chromecast or a Roku.The interface is nice and easy to use. It reminds me a LOT of my Roku, but perhaps slightly more refined. It doesn't have as many \"channel\" options as the Roku, which is why it wouldn't be my first pick at the current price.The Fire TV interface definitely puts the Amazon content first and foremost, which is not at all surprising and is fine by me, since I mostly use my Roku for watching Amazon Prime Instant stuff.When the Roku (which is a couple years old) is streaming HD content, it will eventually--after several hours of binge-watching--get warm and the video will stutter every now and then. So far, the Fire Stick doesn't seem to do that at all.Overall, for someone with Amazon Prime, this is a pretty good choice, particularly if Amazon drops the price back to 20 bucks. For non AP subscribers, a Roku or Chromecast is probably a better option.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JK"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I would like to give this device a better rating but due to the fact it needs to be rebooted like every other day I have to mark it down.  I've owned Roku's and Chromecasts which never seemed to have an issues like this.  The worst part is there doesn't seem to be option to reboot the device from the software I have to go dig it out from behind my receive and reset the power on it...Hopefully they can sort the bugs or at least add reboot option to the software...If there is one I must be missing it.  The speed of the device is very good and the available content is great as well.  If they sort out the software issues I would rate it probably at least 4 stars....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "nh262011"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "My fire stick has connectivity issues even over short distances.

After you experience Prime TV for a while on a laptop, you forget how much better it is to watch these shows on a real TV, and the Fire TV Stick makes a huge difference.
