[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Not as complete a kit as a Roku or Apple TV, since there is no remote, but it is the biggest \"bang for your buck\" for those that want to bring \"smart tv\" features to an older HDMI capable tv.  One of our Panasonic plasma panels did not have any wi-fi features or apps, so the Chromecast was very inexpensive upgrade to the panel.  We also had a barely used Nook HD tablet to employ as a remote and streaming source.  The Nook does not have bluetooth or an IR blaster, but since the Chromecast uses wi-fi for controls, it breathed new life into the tablet as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
