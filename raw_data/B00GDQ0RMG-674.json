Initially wanted it to mirror my Kindle Fire HDX and had issues. Found out the blue tooth function has to be off then it worked like a charm. Also use it with my hotspot on our tv at our r.v..  No need for cable anymore, we have plenty to access through Amazon to settle in later in the day and it's HD quality viewing.  We surprisingly started to use it at home more because of the HD quality shows.
