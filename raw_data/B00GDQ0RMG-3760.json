Movie selection is... OK. I have Comcast Xfinity cable -- which Comcast claims is running at their highest speed -- and still movies hang up with the Fire Stick. Curious, as this never happens with Netflix. Never. Unless movie selection improves and the hang-ups stop, I will be very unimpressed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephen P.

Ever since we joined prime, I wanted a way to enjoy the content on the big screen, this is the perfect solution at an amazing price. Terrific value. If you have Prime and adequate internet service, this is a no brainer.  The interface is smooth and easy to navigate. The iOS app works great on our iPhones and iPad, the added voice control feature is a HUGE plus. Highly recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JandJ"}]
