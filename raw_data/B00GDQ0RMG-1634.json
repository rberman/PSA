The ease of accessing the movies and television shows I want to see is worth the price of admission.  With so many reruns on television during the summer, I just use the Fire TV Stick for my entertainment pleasure.  There are some apps I hope to see added (Craftsy, for one!), but what is available is phenomenal. I must admit, too, that the screensaver photos pre-loaded by Amazon are great -- I find them calming and beautiful -- I mean, even the screensavers are entertaining!  So much to watch through just one little stick!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Did just what it said it would and very easy installation even for me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Beverly L.
