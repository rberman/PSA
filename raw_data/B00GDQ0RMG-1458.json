We have been using Chrome cast and the Fire Stick is so so much better! I love the way it interfaces with my Prime account right out of the box (no need to do anything). I can watch the movies I have purchased in my library in the past, I love the add to  watch list feature and everything is organized by category within the menu\u2026 so easy to use! Tonight we are going to watch a new release that is not even available on our Charter cable VOD yet. It is was painless to set too, ready to go in less than 5 mins.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love this for Amazon, Hulu, and NETFLIX.
