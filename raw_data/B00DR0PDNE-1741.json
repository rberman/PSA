In reality it doesn't work at all for this purpose, everytime I try to stream an HD movie even on standard definition\u00a0it get\u00a0cut out and keep disconnecting. It is really hard to see a full length movie! And I have a very fast internet connection, so that's not a problem.I would not recommend this to anyone.
