[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I wasn't sure that I would like it better than my current Roku, but now I am sure. This Fire TV Stick is great! The on screen screen setup instructions were easy to understand, although it's easy enough to setup without them. It's more responsive than the Roku. The UI only took me a day or two to get accustomed to as well. Great product! I'll be purchasing more to swap out my remaining Roku boxes!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Not really sure why I waited to purchase the Fire TV Stick, and I had high expectations of this product so for it to exceed those expectations is unexpected.  Usually I wait a few months to make a review as a few days or weeks isn't enough time to test out a purchase, however in this case I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and expect you will be too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Joseph R.

Everything you do want to watch you have to purchase movies,games,apps, and very little free good stuff.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "mommyknowsbest"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this worked great easy to install now I can watch Netflicks etc. ChromCast wouldn't work but the Fire Stick did and it's wonderful.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Nora D McNeal"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a cunning device!  It operates smoothly and quickly; very slick.  And there is so much free content available with amazon prime.  I know some folks bought these early on and paid about $15, but it is well-worth the full price of $39.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Matthew A.

We find the stick will connect to the Internet but will not stream reliably unless it's within 5' or so of the modem.  Within that distance, it works great, otherwise, not so much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Pamela Timm"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works ok for HBO and Netflix (although those have buffered at times as well), but has issues with live streaming. Constantly buffering when using the MLB app and sometimes loses the network with WatchESPN and FoxSportsGo. I had the chromecast previously and did not have the same issues with the MLB app and it never buffered for non live streaming apps (chromecast has it's own well documented issues with Watch ESPN app). I think the chromecast is better in this category, but you may want to shell out a little more and get the apple or fire tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Giovanna McClenachan"}]
