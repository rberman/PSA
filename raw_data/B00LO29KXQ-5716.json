However, the one I received could not do that so I returned it. At the time when it kept on losing wifi connection, all my other devices (2 laptops, and 2 iphones) were connected to my wifi and were working just fine. I am no expert but I am pretty sure the problem lies in the fire tv stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Greg Matz"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Just  hooked to tv works great so for.

Can watch almost anything I can think of. Only had it for a few days now and didn't know what I was missing. Works seamlessly with Amazon Prime and Amazon Cloud. Can watch many other Non-Amazon products too. No reason to boot-up the computer any more to access YouTube.

I purchased it at a Staples location for $24.99 (pre-tax) and I was immediately hooked on it.

It streams easily for services I already have on other devices,  and makes using prime video and other apps easy. Plus the voice remote cell phone app is a nice touch.
