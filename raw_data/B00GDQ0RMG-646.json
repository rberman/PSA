I do prefer Apple TV for its interface, speed, and ease, but this does work. I'm using it for a guest room and would not use it as my main streaming device. In addition to the fact that they recommend plugging the device into an outlet (don't think it's actually a small, integrated HDMI device\u2014they say it's functionality may suffer without the 110v.), the connection to Prime was not at all fluid for me. My wife and I have shared a subscription for years, and yet when I went to sign in, it refused to allow me to stream anything and instead signed my up for a new account! I cancelled immediately, and credit goes to Amazon (who I love otherwise) for immediately credited my account back, but it was still disappointing. What my wife and I found out later was that Amazon was changing their terms and no longer letting you share your subscription with anyone who does not reside with you. Not a problem for my wife and I, but still a disappointment and no reason for the device not to work seamlessly. Still recommend, but plug it in and make sure your account is straight.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "David R. \"Abide\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "The Fire Stick got extremely hot.
