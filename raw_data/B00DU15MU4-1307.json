He is not technologically inclined but he was able to figured out how to work it. The picture is awesome! Sets up very fast, 5 minutes or less out of the box.  The only thing you need is an HDMI cord.  I actually purchased a second for myself after being impressed with the first.  Wireless is very reliable so far. No issues. I mainly watch Netflix, but I watch some Amazon Prime Videos as well.  I have not used any of the games or the other features, I got the box for reliable streaming of Netflix. So far, so good!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christie Lynn"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Wish voice search worked for Netflix app.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lyndi Blosser"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!

Selection of free viewing is adequate to good. I would prefer a more defined selection between free and \"pay\" movies.This service could easily replace our use of Cox cable subscription movie channels which rarely have anything worthwhile at an overpriced fee.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kathryn Merritt"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love being almost independent of Satellite/Cable with the Fire TV.  I feel like they are extorting all of us into keeping their services.The apps are great but we need more choices and variety that are independent of having to enter a Cable Provider.I wish that we had a sort of ala cart option where we could actually pay a monthly fee instead of having to have Cable.Using the Fire TV takes up a whole lot of our allotted bandwidth and I have had to pay to add more.I have lost Fox News being on Dish and I have downgraded my package to offset the cost and now Dish is Extorting other Stations including locals and I am sick of it.  I do not want to have to keep changing providers just to have the same thing happen again.Amazon, please provide more apps and make deals with channels provided on Cable so that we do not have to have a Provider.I am extremely pleased with the quality and speed you have provided but we need more options that cut out Providers.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christopher A Mackey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazon Fire TV is one of the best things I've ever purchased!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeffrey A.
