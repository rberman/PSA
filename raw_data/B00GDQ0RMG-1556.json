I could give it some stars because it does project movies and shows on my screen, but no stars for total misrepresentation of product.  This advertisement quote \"Amazon Prime customers get unlimited access to popular movies and TV shows with Prime Instant Video, including The HBO Collection\" is what sold me. What it doesn't say is that I must already be an HBO customer! That's the same for HULU and Netflix. IF I WERE A CUSTOMER OF THESE 3, I WOULDN'T NEED THE STICK. This is the first time I've ever been unhappy with anything Amazon. My Amazon core has been shaken, and that makes me sad. Amazon, don't fall into the trap of all other business we have no faith in anymore.
