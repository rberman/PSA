On Sunday it goes back in the box and there it will probably remain until recycled.Terrible interface, hard to set up , remote works poorly (dup characters), and the app on a tablet is an aggravation.Whoever thought of using a QWERTY keyboard layout with the remote was not thinking.About ever fifth entry you had to go to back space to remove an extra character.Then if you were not VERY careful you lost it all trying to get to the password entry space.The tablet app was erratic. Selecting something was a hit or miss proposition.

I would recommend it to anyone who has Amazon prime , my grandkids love that they can watch all of their shows on it now and I also love it because I can take it to a different room and watch tv .

This is definitely worth the money, so if your thinking about it buy it,we used to use the blue ray all the time to stream our shows, but I haven't used it since and I also don't have any interruption s with the fire stick.
