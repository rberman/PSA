My excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I tried to watch NetFlix using the firestick.  It is very intermittent in working, many times it buffers and gets stuck at 25%.  After googling to see how to fix this I see that this is a very common complaint and many users experience the same trouble.  This is not an all the time occurrence but it happens enough to be annoying.  Amazon shows have operated fine so far.  I really wanted to be able to give a raving review for this product but I just can't.  It is okay but if you like to watch Net Flix without interruptions you should use a computer with an HDMI cable to the tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "becky senat"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good work .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Quoi Tan Tan"}]
