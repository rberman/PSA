[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy way to convert your flat screen TV for Internet viewing/streaming of Netflix & Prime & music.  (Of course, first you will need a subscription for Netflix if you want to Netflix, and need to be a PRIME member if you want Prime, etc...)  I'm not the least bit a 'tekkie' but this was super easy to set up!  You must have wireless in your home to do it, then simply follow the easy set-up instructions that come with the Fire Stick.  One thing that separates this from other similar devices like Roku (besides the easier setup) is that it has a very handy little remote control to use (rather than using your smartphone or tablet) to scroll through movie/prime options plus you can view your Amazon PRIME movies too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "RebeccaJean"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Arrived as promised and I am satisfied with the ease of operation.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "joe mac"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely  love it.

If you utilize Amazon Music + Prime then this stick is great. The 'Remote Control' app for Android could use some work, but the control it comes with works great. It also allows you to watch Netflix and Hulu on here. Very performant, allows for Close Captioning, and just works.  Since I've had this, I have barely turned on my other 'go to' streaming devices.

I am still navigating around with it finding all the things it has to offer.  As the days go by, I might be able to give a more specific post, but as of now, I am pleased with it.  It was easy to set up and navigation is easy.  I did find that  my Wi-Fi goes in and out, especially on the day I set it up because of bad weather and I am located in the country .....I do not believe that is a problem  with the stick but my own connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Diane M.
