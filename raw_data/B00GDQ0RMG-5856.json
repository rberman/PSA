Better than Roku, good buy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JJ"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own an Apple TV and an older Roku HD. I am so thrilled with the Fire TV stick that I've barely used the other boxes since I got it. I especially love the interaction with my Kindle HD (2012 model). I didn't think the older tablet would work with the Fire TV stick, but it does. I like being able to initiate a movie on the Kindle and push it to the TV (much like my iPhone with the Apple TV), but the X-ray feature adds so much more to the experience. Also, the Fire TV app allows me to do voice search, which is really cool. Not a bad deal for $19! It's a must-have if you are a Prime customer and use the streaming video benefit.NOTE: I had a few glitches when trying to set it up. The software update failed twice. Third time was a charm and it's worked beautifully ever since.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "praise74"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "2014.12.05 It just arrived. Still exploring so just some quick notes now.PROS* Easy setup* My Amazon Prime account watchlist and music all there for me to browse through.* Love the Amazon Music option. It sounds GREAT!* Nice FireTV app available for your phone or tablet with voice option (it quickly takes you through an app tutorial)NOTES* Tiny remote - not really a con but it may be for some. Definitely recommend downloading the Fire TV app and setting it up as a backup in case you can't find the remote.* WISH - Would love to have the Audible app (if it is there I haven't seen it yet)* CON - It may be just me but the way the scroll moves images one at a time when browsing movies or TV shows does a little jump that is a bit hard on my eyes. Tried a fast scroll but it is REALLY fast. May get accustomed to it with time but would appreciate a way to adjust the scrolling speed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I just received my fire TV stick today. It was up and running in about 1 minute. I set it up on my 5ghz WiFi and performance seemed good. I watched a movie via prime, played a game and watched a movie via Plex. All worked well. Not laggy, good performance. Fire Stick searches for the remote during setup. It only has 2 ports. HDMI Male and Micro USB female for power. Micro USB would not take mouse/keyboard input that I tried. I didn't test the range of the remote, but the remote was quick and functional.Menu says that there is Bluetooth for controller.Gets somewhat warm - I used it for about 30 minutes.Package comes with power supply, cable, remote batteries and ~3 inch HDMI extension cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Frank_F"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Bought 2 of these on introductory offer. Hooked both up. 1st locked up twice. The other one seams to bog down after awhile. Have to unplug it and it resets and works fine for awhile until you have to do it again. Love the content and ease of use. Maybe a software update will fix our issues. 3 stars because of locking up and bogging down.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike Smith"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We have been holding out on buying anything like this for awhile. We almost got a Roku at one point, and then considered Chromecast and of course FireTV. Our primary TV has a pretty nice computer hooked up to it, so we usually watch Prime or Netflix via the computer and decided to hold off.However, when I had the chance as a Prime member to purchase this for $19, I jumped at the chance, figuring we could use it on our bedroom TV and when travelling.We have found it well worth the $19, and would have found it perfectly reasonable at $39. The picture is crisp, the speed is great and we have had zero issues with it. It worked perfectly right out of the box. Setup was fast. The added HDMI extension is super useful :)The downside is that the power supply takes up quite a bit of real estate on the powerstrip (covers half of the spot beside it). A fairly minor issue, though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TheLeeFamily \"The Lee Family\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Fast, clear, better then the ps3 app I used to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "HS"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It works well for Netflix, but Amazon Prime video rarely works if at all.  Lots of skips, stutters frozen screens and won't-loads anytime we try Amazon Prime video, but we have no problems at all with Netflix and Hulu using the Fire Stick.  This is consistent over time, at various times of the day, and using different high-speed internet networks.  I thought this would be great to take advantage of the Amazon Prime video benefit to stream free movies and TV shows, but just as it is with the very unreliable two-day delivery benefit, Prime doesn't deliver value even though the cost has gone up.  If you already get Netflix and other services don't waste your money on this--you don't need it.  If you are expecting this to work well with Amazon Prime, think again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Texas Rebel"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's okay I guess.
