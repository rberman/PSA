The new one works ok.. casting from a computer, is somewhat choppy but it also had to do with your router so take that into account.. but the main thing that gets me, is when casting from hulu plus on my tablet. seems about 40% of the time it wont pick up, or give me the option to cast. sometimes i have to restart the unit. (unplug it and pop it back in). and other times it seems to have something to do with the app on the tablet. but restarting the app dose not fix it.. no no. you have to completely restart the tablet.. which is a pain when i have to do it 3-4 times a day. however casting from these apps is very smooth, unlike playback from the computer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cy"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "For the price, this is the best media streamer available today.  It doesn't support Amazon Instant Video and Plex requires a subscription to enable streaming to the Chromecast.  The Chrome tab streaming isn't exactly stable either, sometimes breaking in the middle of my 30 minute training videos.  It works pretty well as a streaming device for Hulu Plus and Netflix, but those also require subscriptions.  I'd easily choose a Roku (and I have done so) over this device, but the Chrome tab streaming gives the Chromecast an advantage if you don't want to bother with hooking up a laptop to your TV directly.  Finally, I found several flaws with detecting the chromecast from Windows 7 & WIndows 8, which were resolved by disabling all network connections (in the network & sharing center) except for the active one (either wired or wireless).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel Levenson \"danfromfla\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I am satisfied with this product.
