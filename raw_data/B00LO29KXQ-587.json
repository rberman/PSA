I have it installed on my 40\" plasma screen and the process is smooth as silk. Having the phone app is also user friendly. I would certainly recommend this and will look to buy more in the future as a gift around the holidays for friends and family.Packaging and delivery achieve highest level of satisfaction. The fact that this was already tied to my account made things even easier. When buying for someone else it is a good idea to know this since you can and will need to set it up for them once hooked up. Again, very easy.The remote is extremly functional and is 10x better than the AppleTV remote, and as i mentioned earlier the FireTV app for phones and tablets is absolutely a great added feature.No issues, no problems, no brainer. Worth the cost for the years of use and i am a big fan. Great for kids shows too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "USA4Life"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install, works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JM"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own three fire tv sticks and I just love them, got this one when it first came out at a great price for prime members and the other two I bought them at Best Buy. Before I was about to get me a smart tv which I know now that would of just limit what I can do.  Love that I can mirror my phone to the screen and that I can just take it anywhere I go. Have use chromecast and roku and I can assure you that the fire tv is way better.I don't like the interface, but that's a software issue, hopefully Amazon will change it to make it easier to navigate.Totally recommend it to everyone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J Rodriguez"}]
