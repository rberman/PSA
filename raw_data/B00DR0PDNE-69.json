I didn't need all the app features, as I have PS4, but bought this so I could cast video from the Xfinity website to my TV. Chromecast claims to do this BUT IT IS A LIE. It works for MAYBE a minute and then stutters, lags, and finally stops. Unless Google can actually get it together and make this feature work, there are 1,000 other other, better, ways to stream video to your TV. Don't waste your money on this crap technology.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian Moyer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this product", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lauren"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The packaging was damaged when it came.
