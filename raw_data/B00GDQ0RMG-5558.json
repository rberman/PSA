Thanks Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "flancito"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This review is based on the promotional $19 price for Prime members. At that price, it's hard to fault the unit. But you need to set your expectations accordingly.I wouldn't want the Fire TV Stick as my primary source of video. But as a way to get Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix and other things to a spare HDTV, it's a heck of a bargain and it seems to do the job.Most of my TVs have modern TiVo devices connected. The user interface of the Fire TV Stick is similar to the new Amazon interface in the latest TiVo software update. Compared to Amazon's TiVo software, the Fire TV Stick has pretty good interface performance. However, occasionally it seems like the unit doesn't register a button press on the remote. That may be due to the low cost construction of the remote's buttons, or due to 2.4GHz interference with the Bluetooth used by the remote. Even so, the Fire TV Stick does a reasonable job presenting Amazon's corporate TV UI. (That UI is a bit clunky, but that's common to the Fire TV devices and the Amazon TiVo software.)What concerns me the most is that the video quality of the Fire TV Stick isn't as good as advertised. Amazon says the Fire TV Stick supports \"up to 1080p\" resolution. That may be technically true, but I have yet to see the Fire TV Stick reach 1080p. I have a 150Mbps Internet connection that consistently operates at or above the advertised speed. My TiVo devices, which use wired Ethernet, rarely have trouble playing Amazon streams at 1080p. That same content streams at \"HD\" quality on the Fire TV Stick... even when it's located 10 feet away from a simultaneous dual-band 802.11n WiFi access point, in the same room, with no other substantial use of the WiFi. If it cannot reliably stream 1080p under these conditions, I find it hard to imagine what's needed to get 1080p video out of it.For a 23\" LCD TV in the spare room, you can't tell the difference anyway, and it will keep the kids or the visitors happy. On a 42\" plasma, you can definitely see the quality difference. The 1080p stream of \"Orphan Black,\" for instance, is almost Blu-ray quality on Amazon's TiVo app; the Fire TV Stick's HD stream sometimes struggles to maintain DVD clarity. With a smaller set, where you can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p from a reasonable viewing distance anyway, who cares? Especially at this price!But if you're buying a $19 or $39 \"stick\" player to plug into a large TV, whether the Fire TV Stick or another brand, chances are you're going to be disappointed. Better to spend on the larger, more capable devices that support wired Ethernet and have better processors.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Robert Levandowski Jr."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Here to order a second stick and will be shelving chromecast once it gets here.
