I have excellent wifi connectivity with all other devices so it's just this piece of crap.

Fire TV stick was my answer!  Great new tool to gain access to so many free and subscription programs....all off of our wi-fi . Had it up and running in a very short time. Remote is good but still need to access regular remote to change HDMI port on television for Fire TV. The price is good and I would recommend this to anyone who has an older non Smart TV..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "steevw"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The package is amazingly well put together and the unit itself is a great product. i really love how fast it is and even behind tv and in cabinet have NO issue with the wifi or the remote connecting. One thing  I would REALLY like to see is full intergration with playstore and not amazon app store which is poor. The DLNA support is very very bad. The screen mirroring does work however the apect ratio are wrong no matter what setting tv  is on. I do like it alot but need to be disable some of the STOCK apps that are not used as to free memory and Hard drive space on the stick. For the price it's perfect I would pay $10 more if they would've included a MicroSD slot for picture sharing and video playing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joshua D.
