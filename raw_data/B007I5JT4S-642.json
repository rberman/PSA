At under a hundred bucks its a steal. The tech is proven and intuitive. If you've used an iPhone iPad or iPod touch you will figure this out in seconds. Those are some of the reasons I've given it 5 stars.You can get sports subscription streams, Netflix and Hulu plus, all require subscriptions. I'm unsure of amazon prime. I've read that there isn't an app but there is a workaround using amigos device and airplay.I use streaming apps quite a bit and even though I have cable uverse with all the pay channels I still find myself watching streaming media at home. I like being able to quickly find and watch a movie I want without any additional hook ups or hardware.When family or friends visit I like to stream a folder of pictures, maybe from the last holiday we spent together, maybe from an adventure, he'll maybe you enjoy the kinds of pictures that aren't appropriate for everyone. You can quickly separate your shots into folders or albums and share just the album you want with your guests on a nice tv screen. Beats passing your iphone around to everyone.Based on apple being the dominant force in streaming, media, streaming media and media streams I would recommend this over similar boxes. None at this point will fully replace the cable experience but if you subscribe to Hulu plus and Netflix you can watch most or all of your shows within a day or two of airing for under $20/month.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven M.
