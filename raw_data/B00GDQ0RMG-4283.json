I got this a few days ago and was not able to use it on 2 of the 4 TV's I have ( one a fairly new Toshiba) I've gone ahead and checked all the troubleshooting steps and of course 1 TV is the one I really wanted to use this on.The Only reason I'm giving it two stars is that I've been able to use it on one TV.
