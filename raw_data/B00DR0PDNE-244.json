From the computer, they stream reasonable well, but be sure that nothing else is going on your computer at the same time. The Apple Air is better for your iPad or Phone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R. W. Womer Jr. \"villagevet\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this little guy.  Can't go wrong for the price.

Still loving it. Watch YouTube, Netflix, stuff online easily from my smartphone used as a remote to my TV. First one still works great, using since last winter. Watching a live Grateful Dead California show in 89 on my TV from YouTube using chromecast, my smart phone app. And texting this review on the phone. Does not tie up the phone. Anyway now one in the kitchen works great.  Wifi chromecast =free television.
