[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I refuse to pay for cable, i have a netflix & Hulu account and i use both frequently. I would connect my laptop via hdmi to my tv so that i could watch on a big screen, but that was just a hassle when i had to disconnect it to use my laptop, I considered buying a smart tv, but didn't really want to spend that kind of money and my tv is only a few years old. So after researching the Fire stick i decided to give it a shot.I LOVE IT!!!!! I'm so glad i made this purchase. Now i can watch Netflix & Hulu on my living room tv, not to mention access to my Amazon Prime stuff as well Thanks AMAZON!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Toni \"toni572\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing little device !
