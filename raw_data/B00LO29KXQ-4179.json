The Fire Stick might have a weak wifi receiver, or it could just be my repeater. Sometimes when we are watching a movie the connection will be lost and then I have to reset the repeater. When I use the HBO and Showtime apps, it constantly makes me have to register the device every week. It is such a hassle.  It might not be the Fire TV Stick's fault but it does not happen with my Apple TV.  I would like a way to hardwire it to the internet, but other than that it is a great product for the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Agent Orange Peel"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I easily installed the Stick.
