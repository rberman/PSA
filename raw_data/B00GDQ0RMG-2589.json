Prior to the fire stick I had a laptop sitting in my floor with an HDMI cable running to my TV and I wanted to clean it up.  Plugged in the Fire Stick and the games were choppy.  Download speeds are too slow.  So bad I had to unplug and go back to the laptop.  I'll have to do some research on download speeds for comparable products.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Kenneth Crowe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i just wish i have prime, that a perfect cable replacement", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tran Mitch Pham"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great entry level device on the way to \"cutting the cord\" with cable.
