Not sure why can't they automatically detect the streaming content URL from the page and play that  only on the TV to save the network bandwidth and avoid the choppy play.

As with all Google Products, you simply plug it in and it goes; first time, everytime.Set-up takes seconds. Thereafter, it really is as quick & simple as clicking on the Cast icon, (that appears across all your devices in Aps with the coding) on the same wireless network. There is no additional fuss or installation required.The simplicity of the Chromecast really can't be overstated.My technophobic other-half who hates everything new and reserves special venom for 'stupid nerd toys', began casting in seconds, loves it and is now rarely ever off it. Indeed, I'm being pressured to get a second Chromecast for the bedroom.The sooner Ap developers get on board with with Chromecast; the better. It is undoubtedly the future.
