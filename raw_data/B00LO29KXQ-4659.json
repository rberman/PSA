[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "The \"Fire TV Stick\" is okay, but it does not, in my opinion, live up to the \"hype\" you see on TV.  The TV adds make you think (or at least it did me) that you can watch FREE TV and Videos on \"demand\".  When I received the \"Fire Stick\" I noted that it was very difficult to understand how to get it hooked up and working (You must have a TV with the HDMI port) and then most of the material is that which you have to pay for.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "NS4supermall"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I'm a long time Roku 3 user. I also have a Roku stick and a Roku 2. This thing is MUCH faster than the Roku sick and the Roku 2. It's about the same as the Roku 3. Where it fails, in my opinion, is the apps. There are more, FAR MORE, apps for the Fire TV stick than any of the Roku versions. The issue I have is that there is no way to get to my fairly large VUDU collection. There is a Flixster app, but that doesn't show everything and the app itself is lackluster. Worst of all, there is absolutely no way to get to Disney Movies Anywhere (there are several apps on Roku to get to Disney movies including VUDU and the Google Play Movies app).If you don't have or intend to use VUDU or Disney Movies Anywhere, this is great.

I travelled with it last week and had little trouble installing it, see comments below, and it was nice to be able to view shows I enjoy on Netflicks and Hulu as well as Amazon.Pros - Small and easy to travel with it  Easy to use, see Cons for exceptions  Good picture quality on my TV  Works as one would expectCons - Changing WiFi networks, and original setup, is a pain with the remote's wheel. The good news is it seems one only has to setup each network once as the device seems to remember previous networks. This \"Con\" is not unique to the Fire Stick, but it would be an improvement if one could pair it with a BlueTooth Keyboard. That would also make Searching Easier.  Setting up Amazon Prime didn't work the way I expected. My wife had the Prime Membership and had invited me to join her as a Household Member. Amazon recognizes this when I order something, however the Fire Stick (which was ordered on my login) wouldn't allow me to view Prime videos for free. As my wife's membership expires this month we just cancelled her Prime, subscribed me as the Prime Member and gave her an invitation to be a Household member under my account. This is not a work around for everyone. if one orders the Fire Stick under the Prime Member's login I wouldn't expect this to be a problem, but  it would be nice if Amazon recognized the additional Household Members for Prime Video viewing.In summary, I'd recommended this, and have, to a friend or family member.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "James Eldridge"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts this year, for non-technical family members, and they were a hit!
