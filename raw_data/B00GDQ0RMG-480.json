[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I found the Fire TV Stick did not compare to my existing Apple TV.  I planned on moving my existing Apple TV to another room and replacing it with the more affordable Fire Stick.  Unfortunately, the Fire Stick didn't have the signal range as compared to the Apple TV.  When watching shows on Netflix, I had to deal with constant buffering issues and the picture quality was lower.  I also had an issue locating the ESPN app on the Fire TV Stick.  I believe the ESPN app was hidden under the listing of \"Baseball.\"  For an app that's called out on the main page on Amazon, I found it odd that it was listed as a top app.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.
