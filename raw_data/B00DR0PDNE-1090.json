Easy to install (plug into a slot on the TV) and use. I bought it for our flat screen tv in the bedroom so that I could watch Netflix shows in when I go to bed. I control it through my iPad, but could use a computer or smart phone. I change the source input on the TV to the HDMi slot that Chrome is plugged into and then open Netflix on my iPad (or computer, or smartphone). There is an icon that appears in a corner of Netflix that when I click on it it will send the signal to the TV so I can watch it on my TV instead of my iPad. It is even easier to use than my smart TV, in fact I am thinking about getting another to use with my smart TV downstairs. You can view more than just Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, (etc.), but that is what I use it for mostly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisa Tichavsky \"book worm\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is our second Chromecast purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carrie Berlin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product fast shipping", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David Woods"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jes\u00fas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Omar Aziz ahmed"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I use my Chromecast all the time and love it.
