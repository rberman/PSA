A fairly *large* number of users including myself have consistent issues with it disconnecting from wireless, or at least refusing to actually stream content without constant reboots.  For proof see this thread on the forums with over 600 current posts:http://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle/ref=cm_cd_pg_pg22?_encoding=UTF8&cdForum;=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&cdPage;=22&cdThread;=Tx2CDOG0K31UBSBThat comes up as the *top* google search item when you search for amazon kindle fire tv stick disconnects.I *love* the interface overall, and wish it worked consistently, but then considering I got mine during the $20 introductory offer I can't really complain for the price, and i still actively use it, simply rebooting every hour or two while using it, holding out hope that one day Amazon will fix the issue.  Unfortunately you'll find on that thread that even contacting amazon support about it simply ends up continually doing factory resets, or various reboots that temporarily fix things until the problem starts again, or eventually offering a replacement stick that ends up with the same issue.  There appears to be a design flaw in the hardware somewhere along the line.  Unfortunately I can't recommend it to anyone who expects things to \"just work\"", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jonathan Haase"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Good product!
