But I believe this stick is too powerful. It almost requires that you plug the USB power into the ac adapter instead of any old USB port.  There is also audio issues with dolby digital plus with Amazon instant video. The sound is extremely compressed and is extremely soft. In contrast the Netflix app sounds first rate with dd+. There is also no hbo go, max go, or vudu apps. As for the positives it is extremely quick and connected immediately to my wireless network.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "David Coleman \"gamemaster\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Great software and speed, but get random lines all over the screen like it has a bad connection to the HDMI.
