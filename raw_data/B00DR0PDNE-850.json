[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "If you are buying this device hoping to \"screen cast\" from your device to the TV - FORGET IT! Google has essentially lied in their advertising. After hours of frustration in trying to set up screen casting on my Asus tablet, I found out what was wrong. There is an EXTREMELY limited number of Android devices on which screen casting will work, and only with the newer versions of the Android operating system. Additionally, there is virtually no decent documentation for Chromecast. I would guess that the high rating for Chromecast comes from people who bought it to stream \"for pay\" apps like Netflix.  It may be great for that, but unless you are very lucky, you will not be able to screen cast on Anroid tablets. If you want validation on this, Google \"Google Product Forums\". Then go to \"Chromecast Help Forum\", followed by \"What's your topic\" - and choose \"Casting from a supported app\". At that point you will see \"Cast Screen Missing\". There are HUNDREDS of people who have posted with their questions - using all kinds of devices. Begging for help from Google, and expressing total frustration - only to be left hanging in mid air.  Those comments run from late 2014 thru end Jan 2015.  There is a list of supported devices (a very short one) that Chromcast has published - but you will be lucky if your Android device is on it. Thanks a bunch Google for your deceptivve advertising about \"screen casting\". I will return my Chromecast!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Philip J.

However, it will not work with our (commercial grade) network routers.. LOTS of attempts at configuration, getting support, etc. lead us to the point where we were dismissed as having an incompatible system. Since we had opened the packaging we can't return it as per the return policy... it's OUR fault our system is incompatible and we didn't know that before buying it. :-( Genuinely unhappy about this, but I didn't want to give it one star since the player probably works fine for those with the \"right\" system configuration.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Geocookie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NgOMEZ"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this item, but don't buy it from aSavings.
