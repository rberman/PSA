The great thing about this is that now we don't have to walk over to his laptop or have him take it to the diner table.It works great and anything to everything shows from the laptop to the tv. He only had it for a day and already knows how to use it like a pro.It's very easy to set up with very little time.I can stream flash videos from Newgrounds with little to no lag.I will be buying another one soon for my self and as a gift to a friends & family for their birthdays.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Vega"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "What a great product:  Easy setup, does exactly what it says.The only negative of this is it does not work on splash page protected wifi networks (like those in hotel rooms). This is because those networks require you to open a browser and enter credentials or accept the Terms and since Chromecast doesn't have a true browsers it won't work on these networks.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric Meysenburg"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "it works but not great. I have a EA3500 Linksys router which I believe is just find because it works with my other devices in the house, ie, tablet, smart TV, Xbox. It buffers a lot and that is frustrating.

I have had rokus, logitech revue, WD Live, etc. and this is my go-to because the interface is your phone, tablet, and laptop-all of which you understand and like (otherwise you wouldn't have them!). No more nonintuitive menus, clunky remotes, or unresponsive buttons.Pros:-interface is your chosen device rather than having another darn remote-small, compact size means I can finally put TVs in my kitchen and bathroom where there is no room for a roku or similar. I can have just the TV hanging on the wall without a bunch of junk-fast, responsive, and easy to set upCons:-Netflix does not auto-play, but I assume they will fix it-Still requires USB power since HDMI does not supply power.-You're in google prison, but you probably are anyway.-Limited cell phone support. Pretty much only netflix, google movies, etc.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "jeffrey"}]
