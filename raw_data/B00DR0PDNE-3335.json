It is a really good device when you are playing YouTube videos. could be improved if it worked with other applications such as sky tv, bbc iplayer, itv player etc.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MR S TAGHABONI"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Super easy to install.

I would give it 5 stars if it worked with more apps.  Works well with the Chrome browser on my computer, but not compatible with the Chrome browser on my Samsung Tab 10.1. (tab 1).  You Tube works on the tablet, as does Netflix, but can't stream music already on my tablet.  Definitely recommend it, and as it's a Google product expect it to eventually have lots more apps.

You can't even hear chromecast so now I just use this and turn the desktop off.

She had no cable but she did have cable internet, netflix account and movies on her pc. So with this we can watch videos and any videos on her pc with this device. As long as you have a good router the streaming will look great. And the way you get videos on your pc to play via chromecast simply right click the video and open it with the chrome browser cast it and there you are!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrew Y"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is the best purchase I've made in a long time. it work on iPhone and computers. i love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Zack"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Only works with three apps.

It is amazing. It is so nice to not have to sacrifice my computer if I want to watch shows on the tv. I can't help it, I'm a multitasker and I just like being able to browse the internet while watching a show. It was easy to set up and works really well, especially with netflix. I haven't quite figured out how to watch home movies with this thing yet (non-streaming movies that are just files on my computer), but with streaming stuff, it works very well. I could never go back to life without a chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AJ"}]
