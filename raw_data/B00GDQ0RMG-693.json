[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Thought I'd try the Fire Stick after using the Roku for a year or so.  Though the specs are presented as being superior to the Roku, I've found that it must not really apply in practical use cases.I have a good internet connection and speedy Wi-Fi, but the Fire Stick suffers intermittent stuttering problems and frame-rate issues.  In contrast, my Roku presents a smooth display with a slower connection, despite having \"lower\" specs than my Fire Stick.  The controls are slow.  Again, everything about it seems like it doesn't function as smoothly as it should.  Perhaps you get what you pay for.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "W.

Lots of options for programs for the whole family, many of them free.  I've only had it for a week but so far no problems.  I purchased the Fire Stick so that I could return the cable boxes in my bedrooms to my cable company.  The money I'm saving by returning the boxes will pay for the Fire TV Stick in two months.  I'd love to cancel my entire cable but unfortunately I'm still under contract.

We don't have a smart TV, so we needed something that would allow us to stream from all our subscriptions on our TV.  I debated between the Fire Stick and the Roku.  I didn't want to have another little box by my TV, so I settled on the Fire Stick.  I'm happy with the choice so far.There are a few times where the response can be slow.  However, that can be due to my network.  I'll sometimes go to the application settings and force close all my apps and that sometimes helps.  There are other times where the Fire Stick is completely unresponsive and we have to unplug and plug it back into the TV and that'll fix the problem.Other than the minor issues mentioned above, it's been great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J Tran"}]
