I switched from a Roku 2 (which I loved), because Amazon offered the Fire stick for free. It's not worth the free price tag!  I used it for 3 months, and it would fail all the time.  Programs would break up mid-play, with audio only, or crash and need to restart.  What a piece of junk.  I really gave it a chance, but have switched back to my Roku, which NEVER fails.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "OutdoorGirl"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it it really was just plug-and-play and that's the simplest smallest cutest remote I've ever used I'm glad we got it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wonderful", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kymberly Agurs"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Absolutely terrible.
