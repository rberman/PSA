[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far so good with the Amazon Fire TV Stick!  Easy to setup, easy to use, and the included remote is a bit more user friendly and comfortable to hold than the included remote with Apple TV (though we typically use our iPhones for that task).We also really enjoy the Parental Controls which allow us a bit more control over our children stumbling upon something that isn't age appropriate for them.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kyle M."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.
