I love the fire stick so much i am going to buy another one. The UI is easy to use and attractive. All of the Apps that I use are in the app store. The ability to load screensaver apps is underrated. You can play music (from your cloud or Pandora) while a gorgeous 1080p view of a waterfall plays on your screen (great for writing or a social gathering at the house).Before I received my FS I wondered if the picture quality when streaming videos would be able to stand up to the quality on my smart tv (which is connected by a fast Ethernet connection) I have been very happy with the quality of videos. I generally get HD or super HD while watching Amazon or Netflix content. Some times league pass content quality will be less than HD but most of the time that is not an issue.I love the fire stick, it does everything that i need it to do and more, it is easy to use and a no brainier if you are a Amazon prime member.The advice i would give is is this:1) Buy a second voice remote control, the control that comes with the FS is good but having the voice option would be awesome. You can use the Amazon TV app but if you are like me and use your phone a lot, it is annoying to keep opening the app2) Use the USB dongle that comes with the fire stick it is much easier than running an outlet to the device (and you get an extra micro USB charger for your phone or kindle)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sooner1906"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "If I could rate this product 4 1/2 stars I would but it doesn't allow that. Many features with this cool little device and my sons love the PBS Kids app. I don't have the Amazon game controller and I feel as if that would make this product more enjoyable (for games). This is perfect for a spare bedroom or for a TV in the kids room, lots of cool features. If it could totally replace my current cable subscription I'd rate is 5 stars. I'm still playing with it and learning how to use it. So far, I feel very pleased!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far, so good!

And here are the reasons why:- Extremely fast and intuitive- Wide range of apps (music, news, AIV, games)- Mobile remote support- Games (not that I would play heavily with the given remote)I think the biggest thing that the Fire TV Stick is missing in my opinion is HBO Go.  I am sure they will add this later, but I would really like to have that app available in the near future.  If you are looking for a good device on the market for a huge selection of apps and quick user response from the remote or your phone, look no further!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mitul Mittal"}]
