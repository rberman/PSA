I'm trying to use it right now and the message I'm getting is \"loading Prime Video\u2026\" and it's been loading for awhile now.  I consistently get other messages such as \"check Internet connection\", or it's stuck in la-la land and does absolutely nothing.  For all of you that always have an reason/excuse as to why I'm having problems I have a Roku that works off of the internet as well.  I can turn my Fire Stick off and use my Roku and the Roku works, I have a laptop, the internet works.  I've tried turning everything off and the Fire Stick continues with whatever message its spewing at the time.I can honestly say that I'm completely disappointed in the Fire TV Stick; and regret that I paid for it with my hard-earned money.  I hope everyone else has better luck than I did.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Vivian Pe\u00f1a"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great!

I have had mine for a month. It cannot mirror my Kindle on my TV. I've complained loudly and at length and all I have are emails saying their team of technicians are working on the problem. How is it possible that this can't be resolved without an earth shaking technical advance? It will let me view Netflix and other sites, but I have a smart TV and could already do that. This was purchased solely for the ability to mirror content, a thing it does not do. I can't possibly recommend it to anyone when it doesn't do what it is advertised for.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Jody Higinbotham"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works well amazing amazon value at promo price.
