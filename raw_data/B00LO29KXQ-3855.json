All my movies have an a screen over all content that gives only sound and a blue screen. There is no number to call for help. Save your money and go google or roku because this product is the biggest joke and the joke WILL be on you.I have since gotten an e mail from Amazon stating they would work to make it work. Nice and I placed the unit on another TV and all is working fine. Apparently you have to put it directly on a hdmi port on the TV. If it runs through another cable you get the unarthorised user blue screen.  It is working fine at this time and like the ability to get Amazon music through it. The trouble I had earlier is the only reason for the 4 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DAVE'SCAVE"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i got more then i thought i would! it does everything and it just goes in an HDMI port on the TV!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "scott a kessler"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to set up and use.

Out of all of them I like the Fire stick the least.  It seems like it's the least reliable in terms of maintaining a connection and seamlessly streaming content. I constantly have problems with a dropped network connection and this has never happened with our other devices. Another complaint is with the interface. I understand that this is an Amazon device, but it's very focused on Amazon steaming video. Getting to thee content channels is more difficult than it should be. I do like the app that works with it. It makes searching much easier than using the remote that other devices supply. Overall, I wouldn't buy this device again. I think the Roku is much more reliable and only marginally more expensive.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "laural \"Laura\""}]
