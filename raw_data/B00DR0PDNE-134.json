At first I was a little disappointed because you can only cast using your chrome browser, but then i found some work arounds that made it fantastic! All you have to do is install a video stream plug in and then you can play video files on your computer as well.  The connection works great and I never have any issues broadcasting. Set up was extremely easy and it charges right from the tv so there is no need to charge it.  The device is nice and small so it is portable and can be set up with a cell device using and android app.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "caitlin finn"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Wish that I could use Netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robin R Samdperil"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Macbeth"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "its handy...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Manuel Chavira"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I can't have 2 devices in the house, and the TV I want to use this second one for is too far from the router it appears.
