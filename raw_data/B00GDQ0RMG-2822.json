Perfect solution for on demand portable TV viewing.I haven't tried gaming on the Fire TV Stick, but that should work when you are away from home also.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ducatisti.co \"gnormal\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very satisfied with this Fire TV Stick.

It arrived on time, was simple to set up, and has a great selection of apps. The only thing that I did not like was not being able to active it on the HBO GO app. This because I have Comcast/Xfinity as my cable provider, whom I am extremely disappointed in every month, and the lack of agreement between them and Amazon for activation of the Fire stick for the HBO GO app. I wish that would've know this ahead of time. I didn't see anything about that when researching the Fire stick, and thought it would work, since the app allowed my Kindle Fire HD the be activated for the same app.Still a very good product,  and I would highly recommend it to anyone!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott K.

It connects much faster than my Blu-ray in another room.  It replaced another blu-ray that just wouldn't connect well in my bedroom.  It connects to wi-fi quickly, loads Netflix and Prime quickly which are the two I use, and is a lot less visable than the blu-ray box I had.The remote is easy to use.  It doesn't have a lot of confusing buttons for me.
