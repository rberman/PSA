I got one for my bedroom TV and one as a gift for my mom instead of buying her an Apple TV for Christmas. I have had an Apple TV in my living room for 2 years and love it.  I even cancelled cable and use Apple TV and Antenna exclusively.  Never run into the issues I run into constantly on the Fire TV Stick. Set up was easy enough. Running Hulu is a total joke and exercise in frustration. Run a half hour TV show and it will freeze up 3-4 times before the first commercial break. Video freezes or goes black sometimes audio comes back. Sometimes you can back out and resume the episode sometimes every button on the remote is unresponsive for 5 minutes while it buffers or something then it suddenly registers all the button pushes after it finally decides to start playing video again. I'm not really sure what it's doing. There's no loading symbol or status bar it just goes black or freezes the video, maybe it's buffering I don't know. I spent over 45 min watching a half hour show playing this freezing game. I am now trying to use the Fire Stick for the second time and it's the same issue different show. I could grab my ipad and watch it faster. I'm seriously so embarrassed I got this for my mom I may return the 2nd unit and get her an Apple TV anyway. This sucker is beta at best. No wonder all of the Fire products keep flopping.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J. Hanke"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing value. If you are already a prime member even better. Either way you won't be dissapointed. From the moment you see the box till your done with your setup (about 10 minutes total) you will be impressed.

It seems to work fine with Netflix and Amazon Prime although it crashed several times with Hulu.Cons. You cant turn it off. I have been unplugging it when not in use which is a pain. However, I have to because for some reason some of my TV channels will not work when this device is plugged into the TV and is plugged into the power outlet. I fond this to be very odd since I have cable TV which should not be interfered with by this device.

Well, I miss it more than I thought, but that is the least of the issues.  I mainly use this FireTV Stick for Hulu, but a fair amount on Amazon Prime video.  But, on both Hulu and Amazon prime the screen sometimes goes black, while Audio continues.  Not too often for AP Videos, but a lot for Hulu.  And on top of that, while watching Hulu videos, the Fire TV Stick goes into screen saver mode and starts showing shots from the built in photo gallery.  Pretty disappointing.  I need to check the return period, but I'm pretty sure I\"m sending it back and will just live with Amazon on one TV, and use my Roku and Netflix on my main one, that I was trying to add amazon to.  Maybe if the main Fire TV Box one day gets upgraded to handle my Amazon Music, I'll buy a second, for now, I can't recommend this.  Going blank, and going into screen saver mode on a very common major app like Hulu is a non starter.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Roger D Albert"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "First of all, I normally wouldn't buy a gadget on its first generation. Sometimes I get lucky, like my first Gen TiVO. But with the FireTV Stick, it was the $20 price tag I couldn't pass up. Now, I'm regretting that decision.When I first plugged it in, the instructions insist I plug in to the AC adapter. Probably due to background updates over the network. Then I noticed the stick got really warm, and I suspected it's going to cause problems. Sure enough, a couple of days later, the WiFi connections would drop, sometimes making the stick so unusable. I did verify it's not my ASUS Access Point because my other iOS devices and laptops work just fine.Oh, speaking of iOS, it doesn't do YouTube mirror from my iPhone nor iPad. Worked fine with my Android tablet, though.  And forget about Miracast. My MS Surface Pro 3 won't connect to it!On the plus side, the GUI is nice and simple. Integration with Amazon is smooth (obviously). Watching Prime movies were a snap. I always hated Amazon's web interface for Instant Videos.The remote is OK but it sometimes glitches When I tap the key multiple times, it would end up sending the cursor to scroll way too fast, as if the button was being held down.Overall, this introduction to media sticks is dissapointing. I will stick with my flexible and reliable HTPC.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rudy Amid"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I've only watched one video so far, and I'm getting what I was expecting, very little more.  I wasn't really wow'd but it works as expected.  I will update as I get to play with it more.  But here's what I know so far.It is pretty fast, but there is a bit of lag between button presses on the remote and the corresponding action on the device. I found myself hitting a button more than once only to find out it did get it the first time, just took a second to respond.  This is unacceptable in today's devices.Update, downgrade to two stars (4/30/2015).  Now that I've had this a while and had plenty of time to use it.  I figured it was time to update the listing.My biggest complaing!  Netflix and Hulu videos glitch!  I can very seldom make it through an entire episode without at least one glitch, usually several.  The sound keeps playing while the video stops for several seconds. Then the video starts and plays real fast to catch up to the audio.  It's extremely annoying when I'm really enjoying a show.  Amazon prime video works fine, but both netflix and hulu both have this problem.Pros:--- Works great with amazon video so if this is all you need, you will like it.--- Seamless integration with the fire remote app on fire phone/tablets.  You can see the xray information while watching a video, instantly jump a video from playing on fire stick to phone and back to tv if you need to talk out of the room and keep watching.  This part is absolutely seamless (with prime video only of course).  This is why I gave it two stars instead of 1.--- Allows Kodi/XBMC install.  I believe this is the ONLY device you can currently do this with except maybe one of the crappy google tvs?  Not sure, but kodi works great on it, even though there is no shortcut to it on the home screen. It was a pain to install, but there are some pretty easy to follow instructions online from smarter people than me.--- It integrates hulu with video listings when searching with a link that will take you to the video in hulu. Pretty cool.Cons:--- Layout is really pretty bad. I much prefer my roku for ease of use.--- Glitching issue as discussed above.--- Need for separate power cord. I was hoping to be able to just plug it into the back of the TV without another cord handing off of it. Since it has a cord, I wonder if it would just be easier to get an hdmi extension cable and run that to the TV.  Kind of defeats the purpose of the stick with a cord hanging from it.In summary, if you have a fire tablet or phone you plan to use with this and primarily watch prime video, or kodi you will love this stick as it really is seamless with their other products.  If you primarily use netflix or hulu, I would suggest a roku as it works much better and is much more friendly and enjoyable to use.With glitches fixed, I would rate 3 stars.  With also a major interface redesign, I would rate 4.  It just isn't quite ready yet.Original Review: Most things are pretty fluid and smooth though and the videos stream fine.  I didn't have a single interruption for the entire show which unfortunately my roku is incapable of doing many times.  I have an older one though.  I have this connected via wi-fi and the roku just doesn't like wi-fi as well.  This seems to eat up wi-fi flawlessly so far so definite plus.Another disappointment is I thought that this didn't need a power cord since it plugged straight into the HDMI port on the tv.  I was hoping I could avoid this.  I got this for $20 on a deal though so I still can't complain.  Definitely worth $20 or even $40 for what it does.
