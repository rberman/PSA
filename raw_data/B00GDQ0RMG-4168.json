Doesn't really play nice with my Android phone as far as directly casting goes.  If I try to cast through my Netflix app (like the Chromecast does) it nearly always fails.  Works fine with the Fire Stick Remote app, although it isn't as convenient as directly casting from the desired app.My main problem with this piece of hardware, and the reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 5 is because it worked on my living room TV (where I want it) for about 4 days.  After that I got an error message about protected content.  Can't fault them for trying to protect their content providers interests but it is at the cost of the quality of their product...  It didn't work on my living room TV for 3 weeks straight and Amazon support couldn't help.  Plugged into my bedroom TV it works fine.  It has something to do with it being a newer TV but as it worked the first 4 days and THEN stopped I feel like their efforts have gone too far.In summation, don't buy this unless you're sure your TV will play nice with it...which is kind of hard to know without having one to test.  So, for the price, go buy a Chromecast.  Sorry Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Brandon Rawls"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My kids love it. Way better than Netflix.

I have a 10 year old flat screen that is not smart, but still works just fine. The Firestick allows me to access YouTube, Netflix and Now Amazon Prime shows. I had tried to use the Chrome stick in the recent past and was unable to get it to set up properly, while the Firestick worked like a charm with my computer and TV. Set up was super easy.The only issue I had was in regard to getting one month of Amazon Prime free. My account was charged the full amount up front. Maybe this is how they do it, but that seems a little shady. I decided to go ahead and keep my subscription for the year as I do enjoy many of the new shows they have out now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SophomoricOne"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I just received my new amazon fire tv stick and everything works well. Except the remote. I have had to use the app for my phone because having the stick in hdmi port the remote won't work for me unless I point at it behind my tv.  I would appreciate if amazon would send me a remote replacement so I don't have to use my phone app I downloaded.

Figured why not? I've been using one of the first Roku's so thought it was time to update. Loved it at first, and didn't see any of the problems others have posted about with dropped connection, etc. The picture quality was outstanding, and I really liked the format of the home screens. The beginning of 1/15 I started to see the same problems. It kept cutting out saying \"no network connection\", and I would have to go through the log-in process all over. My wireless router is only about 15 feet away in the same room so no excuse for not finding the signal. Tried with and without the extender, and tried both HDMI's. The other weird thing I noticed was that normal cable TV started having trouble. It kept having little \"blips\", in that it sort of cut out. Not sure how else to explain it. I didn't think there was a connection but just a coincidence. The Fire Stick has just deteriorated the past couple of weeks to the point of at least once a day it can't find the connection, and even while watching picture quality goes in and out from totally fuzzy back to crystal clear. Sometimes the progress indicator just sits there spinning and won't make it past 25%. I've finally given up and returned to the old Roku until I pick up a newer model. And the cable TV has stopped its \"blips\" so take that for whatever its worth. Haven't talked with CS yet, but I'll drop them a line.

Fortunately my son is 2 not 5 years old or it would be a total miss. Also not sure why the Amazon Fire TV has a 5 digit pass code and the Amazon HD kids Edition has a 4 digit password. In short I would love to see both with either a 4 or 5 digit pass code so I don't have to remember 2 pass codes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Phillip T. Mathews"}]
