[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "poor responsiveness and poor account management options. One very important note for people who want to get Sling TV with the HBO NOW package - this WILL NOT support HBO NOW if you subscribed to sling TV through your amazon account prior to the launch of HBO now!!!!  The amazon/sling software will not update and HBO now is not available unless (according to an amazon rep I talked to today - Suarev) - 1) you cancel your sling tv subscription, 2)  wait for the billing cycle to end, 3) re-install and re-subscribe to sling tv.  This will apparently cause the HBO app to populate and you can then subscribe.  I have not tried this and have very little faith that it is a 'fix' but the fire stick has serious lag issues, the controller is unresponsive after a few days, and fits loosely in the HDMI slot if you change TVs more than a few times.  I think this product idea is great and is a terrific alternative to paying outrageous cable bills but this product and the services it provides are not in any way ready - buyer beware!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin \"kjb777\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Exceeded my expectations, easy to set up and use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.
