But I have to say the stick is kind of disappointing in the sense that it is really slow. There is a lot of lag from the time I press a button and I see the icon selected on the screen move. It's even worse while using Youtube.It constantly gets disconnected from my wi-fi while my phones and laptop do not have any issues with connectivity to internet.I really hope the Amazon Fire TV module is faster than this Fire TV stick. I hope I can just get the fire TV instead of the stick and pray for it to be faster.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Venkata Ajay Pappu"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick really does a great job.

We have other devices, like laptops and a PS3, in the same room that have no connectivity issues. I've reset my router, turned my tv off/on, unplugged the Fire TV Stick and it's just not working.

My family loves it! I like the apps and the ability to listen to music and watch videos on demand. The music I had in my Amazon account plays as karaoke! Couldn't believe it, but we sure had some fun with it. The kids like the games too.
