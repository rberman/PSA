Since I have Amazon Prime, we've only been watching the free offerings, but there are plenty to choose from.  The set up  (not quite as simple as Gary Busey makes it look) would've been complicated for me, a non-\"techie,\" but my husband had it all set up in about a half-hour and we were enjoying shows in no time.  I'm still amazed that a device like this is so inexpensive!!  Definitely, one of our better purchases and if you already have Amazon Prime, the Fire TV Stick is a small amount of money, well spent!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susan G.
