Let's list the pros first:Easy set upEasy Home page to navigateGreat appsNow, for the cons...DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOUR INTERNET SOURCE IS MORE THAN FIVE FEET AWAY. I was having problems opening apps and starting shows. When I contacted customer service they told me that the fire stick had to be no more than five feet away from our internet source. Bummer! I purchased a internet signals extender and it helps but I think it would work better if our router was near our TV (this isn't an option for us)Other than that, really like this. Just wish it would work further away from internet source.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica Littleton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this gadget!!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer \"JOCELYN BROCK\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "wanted live steaming tv programs and FS-1", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sandra Swift"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Everything that I expected.
