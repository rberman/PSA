Not quite the easiest to set up. Cannot be used in hotel rooms, (or at least the one we were in) and the search function could be improved.

I have had little issues with streaming, despite my lower internet speed.  I love Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime.  The only surprise was some of the TV Shows on Amazon Fire have a per episode or per season cost.  I should have figured that to be the case, but I didn't.  I went to Hulu and Netflix and found most of my shows and only a small monthly charge.Overall, I have been thrilled with the Fire TV Stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Chill1960"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "SO FAR I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE FIRE STICK, I AM FAIRLY NEW WHEN IT COMES TO STREAMING DEVICES BUT I CAN SEE WHERE THIS WILL BE ALL I NEED FOR CONTENT, KEEP WORKING ON PUTTING MORE PRESSURE ON THE CABLE AND SATELLITE COMPANIES TO BENEFIT OUR VIEWING PLEASURE", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Frederic H MacArthur"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very nice way to watch Amazon Prime on TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Conant E Crosier"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "very easy to set up, and everything as advertised.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "c r zachem"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very nice works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Judy F."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I am so glad Amazon made this available. We were able to take our family room TV and turn it to a great resource for family movie night.  I would have given the rating the 5 stars but one glitch I have is getting to home screen to come up upon connection ... I have to hit the home button on the remote and would rather it just come up. This could be user error and it is not a big issue. Still an awesome accessory for our family room and we are going to get a 2nd for the bedroom. We are even cutting back on our mainstream Dish pkg.
