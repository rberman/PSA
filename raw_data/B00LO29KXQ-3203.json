The FireStick is unbelievably complicated getting around all the Amazon garbage that is being promoted.  If you just want to watch Net Flix or some other pay sites like it, this is not for you.

I tried all  the solutions provided on the forum but none worked. Additionally none of the 4 HDMI ports on my TV work now. Its a Westinghouse 42\" which  is now useless.  No amount of hard resetting fixed  the TV which is now  bricked.

I brought it under the assumption(fault on my part) that I could get the TWC TV app on this. Not only can't I its not even compatible with the FireTV. So unfortunately I will be returning it because for me that is a deal breaker. I have Roku Streamers in all rooms because I don't pay the fees for the Set Top boxes. Less money out of pocket for me. I will be returning it and getting Roku Streaming sticks instead, sorry Amazon I tried it just didn't meet MY expectations.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
