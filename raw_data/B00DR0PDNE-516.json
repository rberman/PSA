In fact, so disappointed, I purchased the Amazon Fire Stick (something I would have done in the first place, had they been able to access HBO Go at the time of purchse.)  The Chromecast is incredibly difficult to get to work.  It took 2 TVs and 3 electronic devices before we were able to finally cast anything (and we have a household that is up on tech items).  Get the Amazon Fire Stick.  It is a breeze to operate and worth every penny!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "vacation4mom"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Had problems at first, figured out how to make it work better, now it's a good product. Ui is not great, does really stupid things sometimes and should include something like all cast in the chromecast app. But overall, it's a good thing to have.Edit: removed a star, really overly difficult to set up on different wireless networks, has general problems. A better idea to spend a bit more and get a higher quality device.Edit 2: Its really not a very good device, I've stopped using it, regret buying it.
