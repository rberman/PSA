The HDMI out on the laptop did not work: the color was bad, and action was not fluid. The same lap top using Chromecast works very well. For a cheap device, it does a remarkable job.Unfortunately, each time I cast, I have to power the chromecast on and off, and sometimes restart Chrome once or twice, before the browser  sees the device. The Chromecast device is showing its screensaver on the TV, and I can see the device in Windows list of devices, but the browser still has problems connecting. Once connected, it is fine. Perhaps there will be an update to fix this in the future.A minor issue is that the device gets very hot. It does go into sleep mode, and wakes up when I select that source on the TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric P.
