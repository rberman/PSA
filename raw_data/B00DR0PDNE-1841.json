The first one I got was defective. It frequently used to shut down and had to unplug and plug couple of times for it to work again. After trying direct power and USB couple of times, I returned the product. But I loved it so much when it was working that I ordered another replacement. Google recommended to use direct power source instead of USB if you can, as it gives constant source of power. The replacement has been working pretty well. Regarding the product itself, it is just as I desired. I am able to cast Netflix, espngo, youtube effortlessly. The quality is just amazing too.
