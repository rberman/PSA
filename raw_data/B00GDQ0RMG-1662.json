I had it up in 10 minutes & it is hooked to my Amazon Prime so all of the shows that I had on my watchlist were already there.  I had read that there were some issues when not using the included HDMI extender so I set it up with it from the get go.  Haven't had any issues yet and I don't even have lightening speed internet.  It works better than watching on the computer which had more buffering issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Deb Cotter"}]
