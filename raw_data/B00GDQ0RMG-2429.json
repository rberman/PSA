[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got this for my grandfather to provide him endless hours of entertainment.  I was immediately impressed by its snappy performance.  I plugged it into his stereo receiver to utilize his surround sound and it works like a champ; If you plan on plugging it into a receiver like I did, make sure you can use the HDMI port furthest to the right, since the power plugs in on the right side of the stick, you need the right side of the stick to be open.  Alternatively, you can use the HDMI extender provided in the box.  It's easy to get the impression that it's going to be a nice product just by opening the box and viewing the layout of the contents.If you have WiFi, prime, and netflix, this device can make a non-smart TV feel like one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bruce"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "My Fire TV Stick constantly has to buffer and be restarted.
