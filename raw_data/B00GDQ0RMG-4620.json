My husband, an electronics engineer plugged it in and had it installed in a few minutes. So far we haven't bought any monthly memberships from other companies yet because Amazon Prime gives us most of the selection of movies that we want. We already had Amazon Prime but couldn't watch movies or TV series because we needed a better receiver than my laptop. It has enabled me to go back and watch other series that we couldn't get because we don't subscribe to prime channels like HBO and Showtime. After we've exhausted these, then we may consider some subscriptions like Hulu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Miz Bejabbers"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "+Interface is nice and slick, moves a lot faster than my aging Roku 2 HD.+Pulls up all my shows and purchases without having to dig through menus+Sits nice and pretty behind my TV, I don't even see the cable for it.-Drops WIFI signal CONSTANTLY.
