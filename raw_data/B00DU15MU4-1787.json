It look less than 2 days for delivery.I, like many others, am a \"cord-cutter.\"  The conventional TV options like DirecTV or Comcast are just way too pricey.  Since I have local news app on my phone, I decided to cancel DirecTV, which costs me about $120/month.I love the array of streaming channel choices.  I like the fact that most of the popular HBO/ShowTime shows will be later ported to Netflix or Amazon Prime, so that was just fine with me.The voice search on the remote works very well.  Also, hardware specs are quite impressive, compared to other streaming set top TV boxes.  It's like having a powerful Android phone as a streaming device.  Processor is slightly dated but the actual UI implementation is nice, the load time for Prime movies is extremely low.In my opinion, if Amazon either found a way to incorporate over-the-air broadcast into streaming like Aereo, or if they collaborated with providers like DirecTV or Comcast (like Apple), and build the local channels into this device, it will be a killer device that no other company can touch.I work for Amazon's competitor company, but I am an avid fan of Amazon's shopping site and I give them kudos for this excellent hardware implementation.  I am now one of many millions of \"cord cutters.\"UPDATE: 1/31/15: The remote controller goes through the 2 AAA batteries about every 14 days.  That's a lot of power consumption.Because of this, I am willing to remove a star from the previous rating, down to 4.  To address this, I ordered rechargeable batteries and charger.  Also, you can download the FireTV remote controller app to your phone.UPDATE2: 5/19/15: I recently added Sling TV and over-the-air antenna for local news.  Sling has HBO, and I'm paying $35/month extra, on top of Netflix.  Now, as for the sheer number of channels that you actually want to watch?  Roku 3 has clear advantage.  Roku 3 even has WFLD-32 local TV news streaming channel.  Now if Amazon can get more local contents, it would be great.  I was impressed at how Roku 3 has CNET channel available.  Now Amazon, you have my feedback.  Please secure more channels.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Highboost145"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

It was quite easy to set up all the things. I don't have Prime membership, yet enjoying lot of things with some program installed.My wife loves it too. She has much more spare time than me and she is having fun with this.I would absolutely recommend this to my friend.The only reason I am giving four star is because you will enjoy more when you have a prime membership which requires some dollars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Pawan Thapa"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "After buying the device you still have to pay for almost everything.

It says that I already purchased it (it's free) and that it's going to download but it never happens; I'm not kidding, I was not able to use Netflix no matter what.-the amazon movies interface is a mess; the prime movies are not obvious in any way, you have to open each individual one in order to see whether you need to pay or not for watching. Also very little info when you browse the movie covers.-the spotify app is a joke too: it's not going to play content by itself, you still need to play music on your phone or tablet and connect to the fire tv; I followed the instructions and yet I wasn't able to use the feature from my iPhone 5S and anyway this isn't how I wanted to use Spotify, I was hoping I can play straight from the Fire TV (Apple TV already plays music very smoothly from my iPhone or iPad apps, including Spotify).Now some users seem to consider this a keeper. It was not the case for me as I already have an Apple TV (which would be the absolute killer device if they upgraded the hardware a bit and open an App Store for it) and a Sony PS3 where I can watch Amazon Prime movies better than on the Amazon Fire TV itself.Too bad Amazon, you came so close and yet you are so far from making \"the box\".", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "the savvy shopper"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I give the Fire TV 4.5 stars, so I'll round up to 5.I bought this as a dedicated XMBC + Netflix box.
