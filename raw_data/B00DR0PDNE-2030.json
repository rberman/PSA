It's revolutionary.The only thing wrong with it in our house is I'm the only one who carries my Android phone with me everywhere.  Everyone else just uses the Roku to watch stuff since it has a remote.  If you didn't figure it out already, you need a computer, Android phone, or Android tablet to utilize this thing.Watching Hulu on the Roku locks up the Roku a lot, though (Roku 2 XS), but using the Hulu app on my phone and casting to this is flawless.  A final note, you don't have to keep your phone on the whole time.  Your phone just tells Chromecast what to do.  The Youtube video or Netflix movie is streaming from the internet to the Chromecast, not through your phone.  If you have to reboot your phone or leave or whatever, the movie will still be playing on the Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Justin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Purchase this so I wouldn't have to buy a fame console to use Netflix on my TV.

The set-up is very straightforward;  I can easily imagine even complete Luddites mastering the installation.  Once streaming, it communicates directly with the router, so I can shut off the laptop/PC without affecting the streaming.

Have to log in and out a lot. Only does 720p. You will most likely have to plug it into the wall as the USB port on your average TV doesn't have the power to give fluid playback.Overall, can't beat it for $35 but it's not without it's bugs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael WIllis"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I purchased Chromecast fully aware of its limitation (can't play certain video formats, can only stream from Chrome browser, etc.). However I was not aware that the only way I will be able to stream ANY local video files without MAJOR \"choppiness\" will be to lower the transmission rate to 480p ... Well that is medieval resolution and unacceptable for this day and age. So beware if you're looking for a streaming of a local content (movies mainly) then probably look for a different device or go back to the HDMI cable as I did ...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Radimek"}]
