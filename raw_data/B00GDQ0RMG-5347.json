[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Very disappointed. It freezes often, hate the interface, not as many channels as Roku. It isn't just a stick that goes into your HDMI slot. It needs to be plugged in to an electrical outlet and in 2/3 or our tv's.... Needs the HDMI extender. The whole thing from the stick to the interface is just awkward. Do yourself a favor an buy the Roku.... A box not a stick. I love Amazon, I love Amazon Prime but they should have limited their electronics business to the Kindle.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tracy Morgan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it, works great with xbmc. get it, now. now, not later", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "F.

I expected a really good product from Amazon and so far it has met my expectation.  This was extremely easy to set up.  It is very responsive, the remote is simple and it has everything to offer that I would use and then some.  It is obviously geared toward Amazon video but you add the apps you want to use and as promised you have the option of Netflix, Hulu, etc. along with game apps.  I honestly thought why would anyone want the games but decided to download a couple to try and was surprised to find it is kind of a nice option. My only disappointment was that many games require the purchase of the Amazon game controller which costs as much as this device.  I am waiting for the release of the Iphone app to use as a remote as they said it would be coming.  All in all I think it is as good as the other two I have and if you have Amazon prime it is the way to go!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Beth"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is super fast, and easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David Ball"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Initial setup and starting use was a bit rocky, but it works well now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Trayer Wiley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Happy with this  easy setup and good selection of movies and TV shows  I also have netflix which has different kinds of movies.

I have my Amazon Prime videos, Netflix, Pandora and the ability to stream videos from my iPhone in a very compact package for traveling.I am very happy with the AirPlay/DNLA Receiver app on my Fire TV Stick. I plug my Fire Stick into the HDMI input on my receiver when I am home, or into a TV when I am traveling.When home, I use the $2.99 Plex media server app to stream videos from the Plex server on my Win7 PC to the Fire TV Stick that is plugged into my Yamaha Receiver. I did not like the old Plex software on my PC, but the current version is very nice. No video dropouts and the quality can be very good. I installed the Plex media server on my Fire TV Stick and on my PC after AirPinPcSender stopped working.When traveling, I can stream videos from my iPhone using AirPlay. I turn on AirPlay and start playing the video and it appears on the TV. The resolution is good.You can also install a YouTube app on both your iPhone and the Fire TV Stick and play YouTube videos controlled by your phone. Be sure to have the YouTube app open on your Fire Stick TV - then select \"YouTube TV\" as the device from the YouTube app on your iPhone (DON'T select Fire TV). The device is selected by touching the icon that looks like a TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "T.

Even though the Fire TV Stick works quite well, the people at Amazon have not allowed Glen Beck's programs through some sort of censorship.  So if I want to see Glen Beck I have to go into my bedroom and use my Roku.  Also, the menu system on the Fire TV Stick is not as user friendly as Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David E. Young \"Dave\""}]
