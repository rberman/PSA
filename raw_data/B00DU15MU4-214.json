My kids love it and it makes for a low priced gaming system. Considering the system is not much more than the games on some other systems it is great. My kids tire of games quickly, it is nice to know most games are free to $5.00 in price. Kids love playing Minecraft together one on their Kindle tablet and one on the Fire TV.

Tried it for a few days. I did not find very many movies or TV shows that were free. I was all set to see TV and Movies . Got a big surprise. Its not what you call free. Most movies cost as much as the old videos stories charged. Now I am looking at the Amazon fire and wonder what I might get into. Your TV shows are First one free and anywhere from $10.00 to $40.00. Maby l got all this wrong. All l know was l did not like paying for a lot of stuff and pay a yearly fee and cost of what l want to watch. Netflix is $8.00a month and that is all and watching movie they have. Am I wrong, get me straight so I want be so confused. If I buy the Amazon fire for $99.00. What can I expect to pay extra.
