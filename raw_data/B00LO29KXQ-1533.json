And all I can say to that now is thank you Amazon. I like the fire stick better than my Roku 3. I have less issues with connectivity on my fire stick than my roku, and my roku is hardwired to the modem. The roku is more prone to crashing than the stick. The stick is farther away from the router and can be laggish but for the must part is super easy to use. And they updated the search. I can search and be told to watch a program on Hulu.

I really wasn't utilizing my Amazon Prime account to its fullest because of this.  I really don't like to watch movies or TV shows on my laptop. So the Fire TV Stick was the answer. It is so easy to use. Just plug it into the HDMI on the TV and plug in the included power chord. It was already registered and I got a \"Hi, Linda\" greeting right away. No other installation of any electronic device has been so easy to set up. I began exploring right away. I don't know why I waited so long to do this. I always have something to watch now and I love the original programming too.
