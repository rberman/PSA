First complaint is that when I turn the TV off then turn it back on the picture does not appear, but the sound does work. The second complaint is that after using it for 2 weeks the chromecast is not recognized on my wifi. I don't know why this is happening but I do not want this thing anymore.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Cedric J."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I couldn't have been more pleased with the device. I can send HD videos from my tablet to my Sony wide-screen TV. The videos can be extremely clear of they're posted in HD. If they also were posted with stereo sound that comes across the TV. It just couldn't be better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "M. Tilly \"Caliguy55\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great item.

Choppy playback and frequent lockups.  Also, your phone/tablet/laptop doesn't send its screen to the TV as done with AllShare Cast or MiraCast.  Instead it controls the ChromeCast, with the data for the ChromeCast coming from your home wi-fi access point's connection to the internet.  Not very good for me, where Sprint's unlimited cell phone data plan is my only broadband connection.  Also, I don't want to put my devices on hacker friendly public access points in hotel rooms.  Besides, it only cost about $30 more to get a Blu-Ray player with AllShare / MiraCast, and they also provide playback of Redbox DVD rentals.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/5", "author": "W.
