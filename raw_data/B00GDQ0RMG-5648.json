[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Very disappointing, I love Amazon but this product should of been in beta longer.  Delivery was quicker than expected and at $19 it was hard to pass up.  Setup was super easy and relatively quick (some updates are downloaded initially ).  What drives me crazy is the latency between the remote and Unit.  Since it at times so slow, it feels like its not responding at all, so naturally you press the button again.  Well eventually ( in 10-30 seconds) the unit catches up and follows those commands except that now you have managed to click 2 or 3 times and now You have to go back and wait again.  On two instances I found myself waiting in excess of 5min for the system to respond and I finally unplugged it to cut the power to it and reconnected it just to get it working again.  Amazon streaming works great but the search results aren't always accurate.  I searched for \"jake and The never land pirates\" and two results popped up, one was 100% match while the other added the word \"free\" at the end.  Naturally I clicked on that however all the choices there were season 1-3 and were all pay per view choices, very misleading especially if parental controls are not enabled to block such a purchase even though the search clearly indicated it was free.  But that wasn't the big issue as we also subsribe to Netflix and they offer that title free.  So I press back, goto Netflix, choose launch app, and after a few seconds (a little slower than on my iOS devices) I get into Netflix.  I choose The show, it starts to buffer and the goes into a blue and white screen of death.  If I didn't know any better I thought they stole that right out of a Microsoft play book.  But this screen of death is not as bad as the music is playing and the image on the screen reads \"hdcp unauthorized content disabled\". I googled it and it's a known issue on roku devices but there isn't much in the way of information on Amazon tv stick.  Will update the review when it's less frustrating to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Rebel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Replaced my Roku with this. Much more convenient with my Amazon Prime account.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Anthony Jefferson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I can't believe how much I enjoy this device. It was worth every penny of the $19 promotional price. (And now that I have it it would have been worth every penny of the regular $39 price) ESPECIALLY if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber.With Prime you get access to a ton of free movies. If you are a regular movie watcher, that will pay for itself pretty quick. There are a good number of free TV shows available as well, but not nearly to the extent that moves are available.As for the operation of the device it's VERY smooth and responsive. There is no lad when clicking buttons. The on screen menu keeps up with your clicks on the remote as fast as you can press the button. (Some similar devices have a small lag) And when you select a video it plays very quickly. No waiting for the content to buffer. Of course that's with mine being very close to my wifi router so it's optimized for a good connection.I found I didn't need the wall plug as was strongly recommended. (Comes with the FireStick) Plugging the device into the USB port on my TV gave it all the power it needs to run well. Note: the device plugs into the HDMI port. A USB connection is required to give it power to run.The remote is very small and simple. It easily hides in a drawer when not in use. Or you can also set up the device to run off your TV remote (or a Universal Remote like the Logitech Harmony series) if your TV is CEC capable. That means the device can be controlled through the HDMI connection using your TV's inferred sensor. I was pleasantly surprised to find that feature worked right away right out of the box.One important note....it comes pre loaded with your Amazon.com account info on it. So if you are giving it as a gift, open it and delete your account info first.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Skipjacks"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I've had the Fire TV Stick for five days now, and for five days I have tried, and failed, at watching anything all the way through. I'm lucky to get one solid minute of watching in between buffering. The device is plugged into a TV that's no more that forty feet from the router. My computer, phone, and tablet all work perfectly in the same room for streaming TV.What a disappointment this device is. It's not even worth the $19 I paid. I'm hoping mine is defective and can be replaced.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Susan C.

I connected it to the Hdmi outlet into my  tv and the screen popped right up.  Easy to install easy to follow ON SCREEN DIRECTIONS. Short program that told you about the fire sick and what it offers.  Bonus BIG bonus.  My husband and I both downloaded the Fire Stick TV remote app through the Google plus store So since I wanted to try the voice remote I now can have that option through the phone app .  I love that it's portable and yes I tried it granted it was in the same house but just to a different TV.  This will be added to future out of town trips.

Super fast", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "IGNACIO KLEIMAN"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great amazon product. This is what we want from Amazon as a product company. It enters the market in the right price range and blows away the competition. I was skeptical about it as I was using another streaming device. But this one is more functional. Sure it brought down the price of other devices. The options available on this device makes the difference. I can stream from multiple providers and the quality is great. I can even use Airplay with the purchase of an app. I can stream from all devices - Android, Apple, Kindle - phones, tablets etc. The remote is a plus. The interface can be improved.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BG"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I bought the Fire TV Stick and Google Chromecast. Both seem to have about the same quality and both have the apps I use (Fire Stick also has Amazon app to watch instant videos). The Fire Stick comes with a remote, so now I could take the extra apps off of my iPhone that I needed for the Chromecast. Both plug in to the HDMI port on the TV and use an external power source. Setup was easy for both. I don't think one is better than the other with the exception of the remote, however, I only gave the Fire Stick 4 stars because there is a lot of feedback when I'm watching videos on Amazon Instant and Hulu Plus. There's a loud sound that happens at least once/episode - this doesn't happen with Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nina"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i got it when it first came out on special for $19, i thought what do i have to lose? well its works great, the first night,i had to reboot it a few times because it said it had connection problems even thogh i said it was connected to my wifi but since then it works great, prob will have connection problems now and then but for $19 thats fine, i am a amazon prime member but watch netflix a lot more. even for $39 its a good deal", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "luis f"}]
