[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Finally decided to try and glad I did. Easy to set up. No problems watching with my Internet so far. Good sound (can't figure how). Will be worth the cost even if I only watch several movies or TV shows and then just put it away. There seems to be enough free with Prime membership to choose from that will be no problem. I like how you can purchase or rent certain video rather than join the carriers of certain movies available. Having your music downloaded automatically is a bonus.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Twirly Bird"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great investment.
