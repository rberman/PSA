[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Purchased the fire tv  stick during prime day sale. Thought it would be a cheap easy way to connect the tv in the bedroom to the internet unfortunately  even though the device is one room and only 25 feet from Netgear Nightwawk router the device freezes and locks up constantly making it impossible to watch an entire show. The device is plugged in to AC power as recommended and the network strength is robust enough that the playstation 4 down stairs and the xbox in the basement both connect flawlessly.Also if the device needs external power the cord should be longer since the device plugs into an HDMI slot which is a couple of feet higher and on the opposite side of the tv from the power cord.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Longtimecustomer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It buffers constantly and the picture is fuzzy when watching Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.

Simple, easy to use and Amazon had it hooked to my account before it arrived.  It's fast and reliable.  Just wish there were more free but good shows on Amazon Prime or that rentals were a little cheaper.  Incentives would be nice too - rent 5 movies, get one free type of thing.  Product works great though!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NaturalMomma"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very impressed thus far.Content boots really fast no lag, perfect.best streamer for your buck!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Desmond Thompson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great! iPhone iPad and Droid compatible.
