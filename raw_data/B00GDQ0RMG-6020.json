I was able to log into Netflix, but unable to watch content.  Ditto for Amazon Prime video.  I would've tried an app, but it only supports Android, so none of my\u00a0Windows Phones\u00a0or\u00a0devices\u00a0can be used.Twice the lag got so bad that I unplugged it to reboot it because it simply became unresponsive (almost like Windows Media Center back in the Windows Vista days).  Finally I just gave up, unplugged it, and returned it.  It was a good first try, but the FireTV stick is not ready for prime-time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rich"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Unlike the chrome-cast, this worked the first time I plugged it in.

I will say it is much better than chrome cast for me personally, my only gripe so far has been that tv shows sometimes buffer right in the middle of a show. Otherwise if you just want a cheap stick that can do a little more than just movies this is perfect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Justin Reto \"Justin R\""}]
