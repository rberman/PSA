I bought this stick so that I could bring it to all 3 stations while I am on shift. It remembers all 3 wifi networks, and fires up without a hitch every time. Very impressed with the functionality for the price. The thing I like most, is that the remote does not need line of sight to work. The remote app works well also. You have to keep in mind that the remote app will not work with 3rd party apps on the stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brad H."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a awesome product, my son loves it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "heather daley"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great device,  works perfectly! !!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "garth george"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Better than i expected.
