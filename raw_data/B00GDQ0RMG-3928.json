I have no problem using the same apps on my Apple TV, but when using the fire stick, it just keeps buffering & buffering. VERY ANNOYING. I was hoping to use Amazon prime more w/ this device, but it takes along time to load & constantly buffers too!

There is one thing though which is a little negative in this whole deal. My country not being in the U.S. encounters most of the time when trying to watch a movie or T.V. show with the message \"Location Restriction\". I became a member of \"Prime\" one day just to cancel the membership the next day. I would be crazy to pay $ 99.-- and not be able to avail myself of all those shows and movies. Any suggestions? For the rest I think I'm really going to enjoy this new toy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Olivio R.

It replaced a Chromecast that just couldn't hold on to my wifi signal. The Fire Stick manages to keep an HD picture streaming with very little buffering while my Chromecast would often offer nothing but a spinning circle.The remote works well, and ships with batteries! It's tiny, so when you lose it (and you will) you can download an app to use on your phone or tablet. This app can offer up even more functionality like voice search.Fire TV Stick is definitely worth a look if you're in the market for a dedicated streaming device, especially if you're already a Prime member. I'd take it above my Chromecast and Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeremy Hobbs"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Excellent item.
