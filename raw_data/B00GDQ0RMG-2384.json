[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I just purchased the Fire Stick so had it for about a week. I like that I have access to Netflix. I also signed up for a free month of Prime, so I get access to free movies and tv shows that aren't available on Netflix. I live the little remote that came with it too. I would definitely recommend this product to friends.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "velveteen Foxx"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect for my needs!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michelle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!
