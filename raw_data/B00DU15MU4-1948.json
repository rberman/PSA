Easy to use, easy to set up. Even the box it came I was easy to open! I wish you could set it up to segregate free movies, or at least include the price when you're searching, but still wonderful.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "No google play support can't even streamI get it you want people to ditch one Eco system for theirs but yeah ....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Rudy"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Needs USB Storage, otherwise great. One of the best priced, and performing Micro Consoles. Perfectly priced right under the MOJO with a Tegra 4, and Slightly above an Ouya. Much better Entertainment integration with Prime all around. Just needs a USB storage option, and please open the bootloader so we can choose to root.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Its quick and includes a lot of the undesirable and random Amazon apps.  I still use my Chromecast more except when it comes to Amazon Prime movies.  Spotify only works if you have a subscription.  No HBO Go or Showtime apps.  Apple TV and Chromecast combination is best, IMO.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jesse E"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Ehhhh. I use my Chromecast way more at much less price. Latest software you can't hack. Wish I could return it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "RYAN C SCHMID"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent device. Especially when paired with Prime. I use iTunes via my laptop and wanted to see what else was out there instead of buying Apple TV and so I could compare pricing for rentals. Works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patrick D'Arcy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Blazing Fast!! Wow I can not believe how fast this thing runs. I loaded Plex and it connected to my NAS in seconds and works incredible. I love that all the main apps are loaded and ready to roll when you receive it. I have had several different brands but this is a game changer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "TheJurie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Been using this for only 5-6 days now and so far, both myself and my 7 year old are thrilled with it. When he realized that he started watching a show on TV through the Amazon Fire TV and then it picked up where he left  off on the iPad Amazon Video app, he said, and I quote: \"Mom!!! That is TOTALLY awesome. I soooooo love our Amazon Fire TV\".As for the grown up here, I too love it. Haven't yet had a chance to view lots of the free Prime stuff (I am a Prime member and strongly recommend becoming one if you aren't already) content but the fact that I can now stream my Netflix content and have access to all the Prime stuff as well is great. And the voice recognition feature works GREAT!Giving it 5 stars for now. Hopefully that doesn't change with further use :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Gadget Queen"}]
