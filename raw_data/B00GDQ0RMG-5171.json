It is horrible It freezes all the time. It is not my internet because I have tried it on three TVs and have the same problem whereas I don't have any issues with Roku.  I wish there weren't so many apps preinstalled.  It was total clutter I had to take a lot off.  Some apps not compatible.

Roku offers more streaming services but caching is not robust. The Amazon FireTV stick seems to have fewer connectivity problems but doesn't offer an AcornTV app. The expectation for good connectivity (fewer interruptions while streaming) and a complete offering of streaming services would be a best seller. For now, I have to keep both my Roku and my Amazon FireTV stick. I only have one more HDMI slot remaining on my TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DonF"}]
