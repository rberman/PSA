I've got a few devices in my living room for internet connectivity but needed something in my bedroom so I could watch a little netflix or hulu in bed before I go to sleep.  The Fire TV stick is perfect for this and it also has access to my Amazon prime account so there is even more content at my disposal.

It often doesn't want to connect to our internet (even though all other devices in my house are connected fine) so it won't play any movies or shows.  We've restarted it by unplugging the power numerous times. And now tonight, while in the middle of a movie I paid for, I'm getting crazy messages on a blue screen that say it's unauthorized and the content is disabled.  So I'm getting no picture beyond this message  but I do get sound.  This whole thing has been nothing bus a massive annoyance.  Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because when it does actually work it's pretty great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sarah Statham"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to use and downloading doesn't take long at all!
