[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I highly recommend this product, especially at this price. It took approximately 15 minutes to set it up and connect to two laptops, two tablets, and two phones. The picture quality so far, from what I have seen, is really good and it seems to be responsive on all of our devices. Currently it only works with your laptop chrome browser (Which is pretty cool), Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play apps. However, other apps are rumored to be in the works in the coming months. I was able to stream Pandora through my laptop browser no problem. The original advertising is a bit misleading as it does require that you plug the Chromecast into a USB power source (It comes with an adapter). You will need to have a TV that has an HDMI and USB or at least a wall outlet nearby. Overall, at $35 it is well worth it, even if it is not perfect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "CR"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works awful with Chrome browser casting using a MS Surface Pro: Lots and lots of buffering, cannot watch anything for more than a minute, or two.  SURPRISE...it works perfectly from my old Motorola Xoom tablet! Also, with the Surface and the Zoom, the Chromecast redshifts, that is, everything is sifted into the red colors.  One other thing: Amazon, WHERE'S MY NETFLIX CODE? Actually, today was the 7th day (should have had the code in 5 days from shipping), but I gave them a couple of extra days to catch up.  But, I will be contacting them tomorrow, anyway. UPDATE: I sent Amazon an email this morning (8/7/13), and two hours later I had my Netflix code.

I used it to watch some Youtube, Netflix, etc all wirelessly with my DLP TV, which is not a SmartTV. I also was able to mirror my laptop screen through Chrome to the TV, which was AWESOME.

Now with that said, I bought it on the first day it was offered.  I've had it over a week now, and I love it.  I have 3 small children under the age of 5, so cords connecting my computer to my TV are tugged and pulled and constantly tied into various annoying knots.  Now, I can watch youtube, foodnetwork shows (I got rid of our cable due to costs), and other great things on the TV without having to wait until the kids get to bed.Pros-Easy to useNo cordsrather simple to set upCons-They don't tell you about the extra power cord, though if you have a USB port on your TV, you don't have to worry about it.Some laptop/desktop issues which aren't too badI still haven't found a way to lower the netflix resolution since I'm on a data plan with a set gb limit", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "David Woods \"Bill\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I'm really surprised at all the glowing reviews here. And the price gouging here is horrible too. If you do buy it go to Best Buy - I waited a week. Anyway, this thing is very limited.  I did the install, tried to \"cast\" and got extremely choppy video with no audio.  The icon turned red, indicated there may be a problem with my internet connection speed, so I checked it.  18 mbps.  Really?  Tried another tv, also tons of lag, but audio worked this time, so I figure something was up with the surround sound on the first tv.  Anyway, the only way to make it bearable was to drop the video quality to \"standard,\" but even then there was noticeable lagging more than I'm willing to put up with.
