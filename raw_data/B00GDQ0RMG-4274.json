It has all the apps we need for streaming shows and movies. Although I feel it tends to buffer more than other streaming devices I've used but this may just be a WiFi issue.

The first apparently had an identical serial number as someone else's product and therefore could not be registered. It had to be returned. The reconditioned replacement would not even turn on because it had old software. It had to be returned too. I have spent two hours 'using' these two items and was never even able to get to the home screen. Incredibly frustrating. Would give 0 stars if possible.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ann"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.
