Easy to follow instructions for set up. I loved my TV before but this was my first 1080p Movie watched and the quality of image was shocking. My TV tells what the input is and my Cable company's idea of HD is 720p. I love TV without commercials. There are SO many movies that I have never seen and now I can treat myself to some great entertainment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TimsWoodArt \"TimsWoodART\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing!
