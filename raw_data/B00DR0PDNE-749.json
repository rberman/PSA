I have two of these in different TV's, one has USB power from the TV, the other does not. The Chromecast that receives USB power from the TV only turns on when your TV is on. The Chromecast that gets USB power from the wall (110v to USB adapter included) can power on the TV automatically. I just open an app and choose to cast the content, then it powers on the TV and begins streaming.You can even cast your entire screen or a browser tab from your PC or laptop. That's a great feature for walking friends through technical things, or just for streaming any content you can imagine.I've played around with a lot of devices like this and even had my computer plugged into the TV via HDMI (and DVI at one point). This makes things so much simpler! Operation via WiFi is really nice.This is the type of device you can gift to someone and not have to explain how to set it up, as it includes simple on-screen instructions.I've purchased 2 so far and I'm not disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "spongebob05"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The price is great, the functionality is good to watch certain streaming apps on TV. One thing that I was sold on was the Add-On on Google Chrome to allow broadcasting web page to Chromecast. However, the wifi transmission is often shoddy at best and there is noticeable delay from the desktop to the tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Icedlatte"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I am very dissatisfied with this streaming device. Would not recommend this device to anyone. Works when it wants. I find that it works best with y S4 (which is not very good) and works sometimes with the Ipods.
