It was so easy to set up. I installed it in my daughter's bedroom so she wouldn't have to take over the television in our family room to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video. We've had it a little over a month and we have had no problems whatsoever with the connection or speed. I'm going to buy another one for our master bedroom.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.
