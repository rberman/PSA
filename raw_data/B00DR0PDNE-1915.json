Tabcasting of non-optimized sites amounts to a glorified slideshow; even with a fairly tricked-out Ivy Bridge i5 pushing to the 5GHz band on a dual-N router and leaving the 2.4GHz channel to the Chromecast alone, the results stutter and drop frames to such a degree that the end product is basically unwatchable for any length of time.  If that system on a 30Mbps connection is insufficient to produce a watchable stream, what can?  Does tabcasting even work with a Haswell i7 on FiOS?  From what I've seen I sort of doubt it.  It does work extremely well on the optimized sites--the Netflix image and sound is at least as good as that produced on my PS3, without the fan noise and at a fraction of the power consumption--so it's fine for use on a secondary screen, or if you don't use Prime Instant Video or other random non-optimized sites.  I use both of these, however, and have to say I probably would've been better served just getting a WiDi unit.  Just something to consider if you're in a like situation, as to hardware and viewing preferences.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "N.
