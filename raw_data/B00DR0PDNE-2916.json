[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I wish I had done a little more research before purchasing this product. The Google Crome plug-in that allows users to \"cast\" the computer screen onto the TV is beta and doesn't work with Amazon TV, in fact the list of items it does support is quite short. The Netflix app worked with Chromecast but we had many problems with the app and I believe this is a Netflix issue rather than Chromecast. If I could do it again, I'd try ROKU next time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert W.

You can cast anything from your laptop, you can cast a google chrome tab, can cast the entire screen but it it is still in the beta.2. Seamless, no need to buy usb cable anymore.3. Install only once in your wifi network, and whenever a person connects to that network, he/she will be able to cast from his/her device. amazing!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Quazi M.
