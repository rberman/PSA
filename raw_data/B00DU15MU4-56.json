Esp. love the remote vs the Apple TV that was small, awkward and u had to point directly at the apple box. This one works when using in my pocket from 50 feet away. Don't have to worry about direct line of site.4 stars b/c I wish the menu layout was better, and less scroll based and you could add apps like kodi to the main page. Apples layout looks better in that regard. That's pretty much the only thing it's better at though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "superstar"}]
