[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is everything I could want in a set-top box and best of all it is completely out of sight. There are all of the apps that I need for my media viewing needs (e.g. Netflix, Plex, and Hulu+). It was very easy to set up because it came preloaded with all of my account info right out of the box. Just set it up on my network and we were off to the races. There are several pluses to the fire tv stick versus chromecast and ruku stick. In my opinion the fire tv stick beats the chromecast hands down. The remote is ridiculously handy to have and best of all it does not require a second device to stream content, but it can still have content cast to it. However I had hopes of using this device for miracasting from a Win8.1 tablet but I have not been able to get this working as of yet. I ordered one went it went on sale for $19 just to give it a try. I have been so pleased with it that I plan to order a second for the bedroom tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Zachary M"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Had no idea what this was when I ordered it, but gave it to my daughter for Christmas and she has been watching HBO and Prime movies and shows ever since.

Funny Amazon had no problem taking my money from a billing address outside of the United States but when you try to access the amazing content promised by PRIME you end up with jurisdiction issues.  Amazon NEEDS to state more clearly that THIS WORKS ONLY IN THE USA. I thought it would have been like Netflix - pay the subscription and get the content. Not so. I am very unhappy and feel like Amazon has no problem misleading its international customers.One day later and now I can't even use it to access my Netflix account anymore. Totally useless. I would love to return this and get my money back.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "8/10", "author": "dawn"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love it!  Too Bad I cannot use it in all of my TV's.  Is there any way I can connect the Fire stick to a non- HDMI TV?  I have TV's that still use a compound connection. Please help!  Thanks!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dreamofjinni"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "This thing came already registered/logged into my Amazon account! It not only knew who I was and had all my PERSONAL data on it (including email address and phone number), but I could make purchases WITHOUT any form of verification of who I am. IT DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR A PASSWORD!!!! Seriously, Amazon?!What if I bought this as a gift for someone? Now they are not only already logged into my account, but they could be charging things to my account without any verification whatsoever? HUGE SECURITY BREACH. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.Other than that, here are other \"features\" of this device:1) You are FORCED to watch some video designed for people who have never operated so much as a VCR. There is no option at all to skip the video (and it's a long video). So, say you buy multiple of these devices (I wouldn't recommend it), you have to sit through the same \"how to use\" video ON EVERY ONE OF THEM. Dear Amazon, give people the option to skip the video.2) The remote rarely works. I even changed the batteries and it's still a hit and miss to get it to work (mostly misses). Unless I'm standing directly next to the device, the remove doesn't do anything. GARBAGE!3) The menus are completely locked down with no option to configure them. Seriously? Even Apple, the company that locks down everything, gives you the option to change the menu/display screen to only show the items you want to see. Apple TV, Roku, and other similar devices allow you to configure them to the USER'S preference - not the preference of some corporation (i.e. Amazon.com). I have ZERO desire to buy Amazon Prime and I don't want to look at it every time I use the device. I have no desire to know what TV or videos you recommend for me to purchase, LET ME REMOVE THAT FROM THE MENUS. I bought this device for the sole purpose of using Plex to stream LOCAL video files.The only reason I got this was because it had the remote and Chromecast doesn't. Except the remote doesn't even work! On top of that, I feel this device is a MAJOR security threat to privacy and personal information. I think I'm switching back to my Chromecast.Here's a hint, Amazon: DO NOT COME PRE-AUTHENTICATED TO A USER'S ACCOUNT. And stop FORCING your other \"services\" on users.This is the only Amazon device I own and it will be the last. There is absolutely NO reason for this thing to need to know my personal information. I can only imagine how bad their other devices must be.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nunya"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just wanted to add my two cents - had an excellent experience hooking this stick up to my Oppo blu-ray player, primarily to stream PRIME/Netflix shows/movies. Quick hook-up, and fast streaming, even in my rural area (via Comcast cable). Shows stream in HD quality (projected on a large screen) and most seem to stream in 5.1 Dolby, so I'm pleased! At this price point, it seems like a no brainer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gengler"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We are loving the fire stick!
