I ordered it month`s ago, when they had a special for Prime members. Paid $19 for it and it`s worth 3 times as much.

The videos ran without stopping, when I paused, it paused, and when I exited, it exited. The remove is very simplistic and I may train one of my smart remotes to immulate the fire stick remote. The only drawback is the need for more power to run the stick. The cord is a little short for what I needed, but it works.  I like this enough to buy another unit for my other TV set. I would recommend this to everyone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "hope coman"}]
