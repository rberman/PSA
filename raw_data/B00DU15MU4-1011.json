At least two of the movies I watched were dated back to 2006.  I was under the impression that the movies would be more current.  The movies that I did watch were also shown on current tv channels.  Also, I subscribe to NetFlix but I had to pay to see the movies from netflix via Amazon's fire tv.  Why was I not able to watch netflix without paying for it?I never could bring up Hulu although you advertised the availability of watching both Hula and Netflix.  I was very disappointed in the fact thatthe product was not as represented.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "M.

No setup required.  I often have a slow network where Amazon over my blue ray would stop and buffer constantly, the Fire TV suffers none of this.  Watched 2 movies tonight in full HD w/o any buffering what-so-ever, just like watching a DVD.

I do not need a powerful device for streaming content, I wanted the Fire because I thought it would be more reliable at streaming from a Plex server. So far, I have not been able to get it to play through an entire movie before freezing and the Fire has to be shutdown in order to get out of it.To the Amazon support team; I have uninstalled and reinstalled Plex. I have reset the Fire to factory defaults. I am streaming over a 5ghz band from a Linksys AC router. My Roku 3, Xbox 1, PS4, laptop, phone, tablet, etc. all handle streaming on the same connection (not all at the same time) just fine, the Fire is the ony device that gives me trouble. All the settings are set to stream at 12mbps 1080p. I really wanted the Fire to replace the Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ethan"}]
