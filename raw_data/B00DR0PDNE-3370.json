My wireless signal was not strong enough for it to work properly but the range extender worked well for the chromecast device and also made connections for my phone and laptop much better throughout the house.I did find that when I installed the range extender I had to be sure it had the same name as the wireless router and not the default name the range extender would have given to the new extended wireless network, the insturctions that came with the range extender did allow me to keep the name the same,  I assume since the content comes from the main wireless router and the chromecast device was working through the extender they needed the same network name to be recognized by the phone which is how you control the netflix movies.  Also the phone must also be using the same extended wifi network as the chromecast device.so it took a little getting use to becaue of the distance of the tv from the primary router and the need for the range extender.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rocco Costello \"Engineer\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very useful for me because I spend long hours to watch YouTube more than TVThank you thank you thank you", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sultan"}]
