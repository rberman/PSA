Unless you're watching one of Amazon Prime's produced shows, most everything else you have to pay for even after paying for Amazon Prime.  Say you want to watch an old Closer or Lost, you have to pay for each episode!  I guess it's time for me to a Netflix account.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "V.
