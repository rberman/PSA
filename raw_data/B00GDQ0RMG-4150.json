It is small, easy to set up and provides very nice HD images of the programs it streams- HOWEVER, it is mostly to sell you Amazon content, and does NOT incorprate a full web browser. It will NOT convert you TV into a \"smart TV\". You get the standard  built-in apps (Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc) but you cannot go outside of Amazon's  programmed plan for this. That said, the remote is small (about half the size of a smart phone), and the set- up is fairly simple, although I had to call Comcast to re-configure my router output to match what the Fire Stick would pick up. All in all, I say wait for the next generation, this one is too limited in its scope~", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Hozer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The fire stick is easy to install and easy to use.

I cannot imagine buying a smart TV for the price they are going for, so this is a great alternative. I keep mine plugged in a HDMI port in my TV so it is always ready when I want to use it. I like that I can switch between Youtube, movies and TV shows quickly and easily. The remote is simple, easy to use and has a long range. I can play and pause from anywhere in my 1500 sq. ft single level house. The screensaver feature with the pretty images are a nice touch. There is a wide selection of apps which is nice, but the game selection leaves a little to be desired. My only issue so far is connectivity issues. It seems to only happen with TV shows and certain apps. Movies have always played well for me. I don't believe it's an issue with my Wifi, but it could be. I am a little confused by the power supply. I am not sure if it holds a charge or if I am supposed to keep it plugged in all the time. I will have to experimet more, as the power cord is fairly short so I can imagine circumstances where it would not reach an outlet while plugged into a TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rhianne"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use with so much that it offers!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Megan S."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Finally, finally, FINALLY - a simple, direct what to make use of my Amazon Prime subscription on my TV, without needing a separate PC hooked up to it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer \"Reed Savory\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy to install, directions were clear, video is helpful once you get started. the battery case is hard to open i  was afraid that the remote was going to break.
