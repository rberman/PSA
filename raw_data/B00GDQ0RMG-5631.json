Wifi on this device is absolutely horrid.5 Ghz is spotty and 2.4 Ghz isn't much better. I switched out my router thinking that was the problem but all of my other wireless devices perform as expected. A quick google search will back up my claims about the poor performing wifi on this device. The remote seems to \"skip\" through selections while navigating items in the menu. I thought it was a problem with Netflix, but it does the same thing under the Fire stick menu, HBO GO, etc. push right on the navigation rocker once, sometimes it will jumps ahead 5-6 selections. If it only did this every once in awhile it would n't that big of a deal, but it does it all the time. Take my advice and either spend more on the Fire Tv or go with a Roku, Apple TV or similar media box. This stick is junk. I REALLY wanted to like this thing. Waste of time and money.Amazon is on to something with their media streaming devices. The interface is fast and well laid out. Remote is well constructed, buttons are clicky and works very well. I've sideloaded XBMC on the the stick and WOW, it works very, very well, even better than my Apple TV which I was hoping the stick would replace and will completely as soon as Amazon allows HBOGo. You can spend $100 on another device and probably wont get the same experience as this tiny device. This runs so well that I wonder what the Fire TV runs like when that has so much more power! For $39 you CAN'T beat this, best bet for your home theater needs! Just get it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Jon Diaz"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It is an okay device.  Not great.  Playback will freeze, then quickly catch up skipping parts.  Remote jumps 2 or more spaces when browsing.

I wish the voice controller was included, but understandable that it was not. Amazon needed to cut the costs somewhere. Also, if you have the application for your either your phone or tablet, then you can use the voice search functionality through that medium. Overall, this is an exceptional buy. Amazon has a gem on their hands with this one. The only downside I see is that search functionality is still only for amazon related content and not system wide. Once this changes, it will be a game changer for this little device. Roku already has this, now it\u2019s time for the Fire TV Stick to follow suit. My recommendation is buy, buy, buy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "James Garland"}]
