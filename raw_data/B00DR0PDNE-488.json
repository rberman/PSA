[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I don't use Hulu or any of those other internet TV options so the Chromecast did not initially interest me. The second I read an article about how it was upgraded to enable my cell phone to cast to it then I was sold. I also use Videostream to watch movies from my laptop and it works perfectly. If you don't have a smart TV and you are tired of hooking up the HDMI cord and running it from your laptop to your TV then it is time up upgrade to Chromecast.
