With a very simple installation and easy on-screen commands, in a wink, our TV was playing beautiful music and a slide show of some absolutely stunning stock photography. Obviously it also has the advantage of bringing all of your Amazon prime viewing to your television, but the world-class photography images in the slide show made for a happy surprise.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Leerador"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Would be great if it were ready for prime time.  But it's not.  I am a controls engineer with several years of enterprise IT experience before that.  And this device has the temperment of a wife.  It can work flawlessly for hours, then, at the drop of a hat, for no rhyme or reason, will loose connection, or connect with problems.  I've tried everything from moving equipment around, changing WiFi settings, disabling DHCP and setting up everything manually, restarting it, yelling at it, walking out of the room, and sleeping on the couch in front of my AppleTV.  So far, sleeping on the couch works best as in the mornings the Fire TV Stick apparently wakes up more refreshed on the bedroom tv and will start working.  For no known reason.  With no changed variables.The thing is nuts.  And with it working this sporadically means that the hardware isn't capable of handling the network load, which is rare, or that there is faulty programming to blame since restarts sometimes fix it.  It needs major updates and more reasoning as to why it's failing and what the problems are.Also, should you be reading this review for troubleshooting, to restart from the remote press and hold select and play/pause.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/8", "author": "T.

The fire stick is great for media, but as most know it still lacks the needed HBO go and Xfinity apps.  The thing I don't like about it is that you can't sort through all the Prime options- for example, I can't find a way to look for just a PG or G movie for the family.  It presents options in pre-programmed buckets (like what's new or popular), but I can't take those and refine the list instead I have to sort through lots of options to find suitable programming.  I'll see if parental controls helps here.If the product folks are reading this, the killer app for me would be able to search for movies across any service.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "robk"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.
