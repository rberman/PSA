It sure has a lot to offer and the remote is really cool. I'm sure after using it for a while and watching a few movies, it will more than pay for itself.

I have only used Amazon Prime and the stream is excellent. This is a great product at a very reasonable price.I was too quick with my original review. I was in the middle of a movie when the Fire Stick died. It lost internet connection and network properties showed \"connected with problems\". I did a factory reset and now cannot connect to my router. All of my other wireless devices work fine.
