I own a Chromecast as well, but enjoy having a dedicated remote and easy to use interface that's provided by the Firestick GUI. Chromecast can be nice to stream YouTube videos and such from a cellphone or tablet, but it's clunky and sometimes difficult to switch between Netflix or YouTube without reseting the device. I haven't had any issues with the Fire Stick in this regard. The inclusion of casual games is also awesome.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John C.
