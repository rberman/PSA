The Fire Stick is a PITA to set up if you don't broadcast your SSID, claims it's buffering (I work for Comcast, so pretty sure my internet is fast and reliable), and difficult as heck to scroll around to find what you need.  I'm not talking to my remote because that's just nuts, so haven't tried that feature.  I do like the auto-play with Netflix and Crackle, but that's like saying I like the garnish that was on my dinner plate.  Looking forward to losing a small, black remote any day now, too. At least with the Roku remote, you could look for the little purple tag.
