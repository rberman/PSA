But be forewarned if you are purchasing this as I did, as a results of the HGTV advertisements to use Chromecast and the HGTV Watch phone/tablet app to watch your favorite HGTV shows on a large TV: you cannot cast the live HGTV programming to your large TV.  You can only cast the previously-aired show library, which is fairly good.  Also, of course, you need to be paying a cable provider for HGTV and login using those credentials.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Nice", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Javier"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "wodks great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "norman ayala"}]
