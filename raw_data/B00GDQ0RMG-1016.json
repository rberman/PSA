As you can imagine, we were all very disappointed when we discovered that none of her favorite apps (most notably Minecraft) are supported by the Fire TV Stick.Our smart tv already streams Amazon Prime and Netflix without the aid of the Fire TV Stick, so the sole purpose for this purchase was to provide platform for app gaming that didn't require the Kindle Fire. For our purposes, the Fire Stick is not at all useful and a great disappointment.As a streaming device for movies it performs well, but if you own a smart tv you won't need this device to stream amazon, netflix, hulu etc, you only need an internet connection. You DO need it to access Amazon game apps, though. Unfortunately, only half of the apps are supported by the Fire Stick.I would sincerely recommend saving your money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Zya"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I returned the device.  It wasn't able to pick up my Wifi signal to connect.  I was looking for something to watch movies on.  My Roko 2 doesn't working with my Flat Screen TV, so I thought that the Fire Stick would.  I have a big house and I guess the wifi was too far.  I could have purchased a booster to up the signal, but decided against it.  I was thinking about purchase the other Fire TV device, but if it doesn't work, I don't want to send it back and get charged for a restocking fee.  I can always purchase it from Best Buy, they don't charge for restocking.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "B.

It will tell you the broadband width will cause slow play, but I click on play instead of wait and it does okay.  Picture is not great, but okay.  Netflix signal and lack of buffering has always been very good when I used wii.  Amazon was unwatchable on wii due to buffering so you couldn't even follow conversations, but firestick works better that wii did.  At least family can watch shows on TV rather than just me on computer all the time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Dana Newingham"}]
