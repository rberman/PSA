Netflix, hulu+ and even streamimg directly from my pc caused buffering problems. Luckily a had a roku setup om the same tv and when the tv stick would buffer or freeze, I could connect with my roku and continue watching my show or movie without this particular issue. The fire tv stick has a lot of potential but my primary reason purchasing this product is streaming movies and shows and it doesn't meet my expectations in that respect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"blue hen\""}]
