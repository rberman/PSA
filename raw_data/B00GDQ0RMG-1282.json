My last trip to the movies inspired my purchase.  My home has a movie room, but I was reluctant to try various streaming devices.  Boy was I wrong.  I not only save money now, but I enjoy my movie room!  I had to install the extension provided with the product.  Without the extension, I had buffering and connection problems.
