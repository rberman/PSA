The combination of low price, snappy performance, and selection of streaming sources is beyond anything else on the market. I've been a longtime AppleTV user, but will be upgrading my TVs to Fire devices.My biggest concern was the speed of the device. There may be a some difference between the capabilities of the Fire stick and the full Fire TV box, but it was so minor I really couldn't tell a difference.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jesse"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Overall, I'm happy with the FireTV stick.  Menus load quickly and there are a wide variety of streaming services that work as well as apps (such as Pandora, Spotify Connect, etc.).The interface is a little confusing at times and highly favors Prime video and music, which is to be expected with a product from Amazon.  Universal search would be a great feature.  Also, since the remote is bluetooth, I am unable to control the FireTV through my Harmony remote.  That said, you can't beat the offering considering the price point.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jay4190"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy set-up, best way I have seen to use Amazon Prime!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bret P Stone"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It's great! Ease of installation. You need to include the information about the remote in the instruction. Had to go online to get what I needed.

I know it works because my apple TV device was in the same location as the Fire TV Stick. I moved it to a another room, which was further away, and it worked. I had to wait for the update, which was expected. Then, you have to sit through an instructional video. This was a little annoying since it's actually easy to use.  The USB connection for power is problematic on some TV's depending on the locations of the HDMI and USB.I am not sold yet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "12/16", "author": "Timothy Bickford"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "pretty cool :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "shawn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am very impressed with the Fire TV Stick.My internet connection is a little slow, so I didn't know what to expect; I had been using the app built-in to my Panasonic TV to stream Amazon Prime videos and I would get \"buffering\" 5-6 times during most  movies, each time taking 2-3 minutes to re-start. That's not a pleasant way to watch a movie and I had almost given up on video streaming.Since I connected the Fire TV Stick I have watched 3 movies, 2 without ANY need for buffering and 1 with a 5-10 second buffering. I don't know how they did it, but I'm very happy they did. Setup was a breeze, although I had to use the included HDMI extension to avoid the stick loosening up from its own weight when directly plugged into the TV,", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Huddleson \"camera geek\""}]
