It is easy to navigate and the set up walks you through everything.  I brought this on vacation though and attempted to use this in our hotel. I was able to connect to the WiFi but the hotel also had a web page that needed the terms accepted, and I could not do this (or access any web page) with the Fire TV stick.  It was very unfortunate since we had planned on watching Netflix for the three weeks we were gone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shamulove"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "compact and easy to use...the mobile app is tremendous!
