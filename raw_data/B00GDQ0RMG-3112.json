[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "In the last few days, I think Amazon has finally update the Stick software to allow Windows 8.1 devices to mirror via Miracast.  I was just now able to use my Windows RT tablet and Windows 8.1 laptop to \"Project My Screen\" to my TV via the Fire TV Stick.  (Charms --> Devices --> Project -->  Add the Fire TV Stick as a device, and let all the drivers load.)  I can send video and audio when I'm on websites, but I'm having trouble sending audio when I'm on apps like Netflix, XBox Video, etc.  I'm poking around to see if there's some setting I need to change.  Still, after months of being disappointed that I couldn't \"Project My Screen\" to the Fire TV Stick, I'm very encouraged by the new development.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "IM Poster"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Wanted to like this product.

I find the Roku is still the preferred device for most of what I want to use it for. The biggest complaint I have about it is the fact that all screens are full of movies and shows that I don't want to watch. I mostly use Plex and occasionaly Prime TV and Movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G. Peterson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "seriosly, best purchase I've made in a while. I used to stream all my videos from my laptop to my tv through an HDMI cable. It was nice, but still a hassle to start up and shut off. I saw that stupid commercial with Gary B. And thought, what kind of idiot would buy suck a thing. This idiot did, and I effing love it. The remote that comes with it is pretty slick, but not as slick as the touch smart free phone app remote, of which kicks mucho ass-ee-blay.
