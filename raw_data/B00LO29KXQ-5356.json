[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you're looking for a streaming solution this is the best entry level option. After purchasing the ChromeCast I quickly became annoyed with having to stream from a device (computer/phone/tablet). The Fire TV Stick has the apps locally so no need for a separate device. Also with this you get 30 days free of prime which has lots of movies and shows you've actually heard of.This is the product to get if you're debating the two.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.

The PLEX app needed some serious update to fix this issue.Tried all the possible settings I googled to make it work better but it still did not make any difference.

But with the need for the power source to the stick, very similar to the box version.

Actually ended up taking our roku upstairs and trying this downstairs. Not much better. Took forever to download netflix and hulu. Screen freezes but audio runs. Wrestled for quite a while just to get batteries into the remote. Online now buying another roku device. Google chromecast even blows this away.
