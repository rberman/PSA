Do not get this if you want to watch Hulu Plus until they fix the black screen issue.  About every 3rd episode after the ads you'll get a black screen but you'll still hear audio.  You have to exit the app and clear the cache for the app in settings.  Then when you go back to watch the episode again it starts you from the beginning and you get to watch the wonderful Hulu Plus ads all over again.-UPDATEDied on me after 2 months.  Worked last night, went to turn it on today, doesn't work.  At this point would not recommend.  Wait until a new version of it comes out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "Jeff Manning"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For $99, simply a must-have.
