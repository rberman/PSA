The only thing I don't like about Apple is that each one of their devices has to have a different password. That gets confusing. The other thing I don't like about Apple TV is that it doesn't stream Amazon videos. Why have an Amazon prime account and not be able to use the streaming video feature. When Apple decides to stop being stubborn about not doing this, I will return to Apple TV. Until then, I'm going with Roku.
