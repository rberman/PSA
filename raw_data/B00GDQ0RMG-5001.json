If you're looking for a one-stop system for all your entertainment apps, this is the product for you. I have Fire TV Stick and Google Chromecast. While I give them both 5 stars, the Fire TV Stick is more user friendly for those who are not as technologically inclined or more used to a cable operating system.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian H."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Quick setup works well love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "evil \"evil\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "While this is a nice, small sized unit with the remote, I am returning this and am not satisfied.Frequently, when watching Netflix, it will suddenly say there's no connection and stop. I can try again several times, and usually nothing happens. Occasionally, I can reboot the device and it will begin working, but not very often. When I go into the diagnostics and check the network, it puts a big, red X in front of every Netflix server.However, when I switch to another HDMI port that has my Roku stick, Netflix plays fine.Also, there is no internal way of playing local video, and I use this feature enough on my Roku that it is annoying to not have it.Basically, I have to keep my Roku stick installed in order to maintain reliable service and to play local videos. So, what is the point of having the Fire TV Stick? The Roku will still play Amazon Video just fine, including my Prime account.I don't know if the Netflix issue is just an unfortunate occurrence for me, or if it's a ploy to get you to watch Amazon Video! :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Matthew J.
