I bought it at best buy along with a kindle paperwhite . Both good choices and I am pretty satisfied. I like the fact that it has a remote and compared with the remoteless chromecast, it was a deal breaker for me. I did love that it turns off or it suspends itself while there is inactivity of 30 minutes. I speficially use it for Netflix YouTube and Wwe network . I recommend to anyone who is looking for a streaming device for their home . Great price at $40", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karen Wolter"}]
