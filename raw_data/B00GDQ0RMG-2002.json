Dont get me wrong my grand child figured it out in 2 seconds. Me however was baffled for a few.I like the fact that most apps can be accessed on it.

I bought it on the road and it didn't work in the hotel from the hotel's wifi as advertised, but all it needed was a quick software update.  I paired it with the hotspot on my phone, downloaded the update and then switched to the hotel's wifi.  Worked like a charm after that.  If you're buying this to use in a hotel, make sure to download any updates from home, before hitting the road.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kdub"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Could stream quicker..less buffering", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I am returning this. I was extremely frustrated almost from the get go. It was very easy to set up, even for someone as non-tech savvy as me. I admit I do not totally understand apps and whatnot, but I was exasperated to learn that the \"free\" app usually come with a monthly fee in order to get of the programming. My TV needs are very, very limited, and I also did not like all the extra garbage advertised when you start the fire stick. All I wanted was something simple to replace satellite that would allow me to view ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS and classic TV.
