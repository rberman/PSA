I have the Fire TV Stick on one TV currently and it will be replaced with a ROKU. No subscriptions required to gain access and NETFLIX seems to be the best option I have seen so far. No extra charges required for their movie or TV library.

The other 2 tv's, it comes to the home screen then just blacks out. One TV is an older flat screen, about 6 years old, one TV is brand new- weeks old, and my tv that's about 4 years old it works fine on. I'm annoyed it doesn't work on my main TV in the living room- that's what I got it for since I cancelled cable and am now just streaming. I can only stream in my bedroom. \ud83d\ude14", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Caitlin Krombach"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you love TV your gonna love this", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jb"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is an amazing alternative to cable TV!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stacy"}]
