[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "We've only had the fire stick for a few days, but it has already exceeded expectations. We have a chrome-cast as well, and though it works fine and largely does as advertised, I prefer the interface of the fire stick, with a menu on board rather than having to \"cast\" your content through individual apps. The remote app for iPhone is significantly more responsive and reliable than the separate interfaces necessary through chromecast (though this does seem an area where there still might be some room for improvement).I will continue to use the chromecast for the occasional you-tube vid or pandora (is there a pandora app for the fire stick? I haven't checked) but will use the fire stick for Netflix and of course all the great Amazon instant video content.Very happy with this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fire stick is so easy to use and the voice Remote works very well also .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "oddjob51"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Would be a lot cooler if it had an Internet browser and could download hbogo", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott Buzzard"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's awesome!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Janice Hargroder"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent have a couple of questions but like it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Linda Inglis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Yes, it did meet and maybe exceed my expectations.  It was easy to install and I was even able to load the App on my iPhone to use as a remote.  That was an unexpected plus.  The movies and TV shows stream perfectly, just as the regular TV broadcasts.  There are a few TV shows that I never watched from the beginning and I'm able to get them and catch up to the new season.  While  I am enjoying the movies and TV shows on Prime still I wish that they were more updated to newer versions.  When I select newer shows and movies, I'm frustrated by the charges.  I don't like to be \"nickeled and dimed\" in this way.
