I'm not a big fan of smart TVs.  My inlaws have issues with their apps being out of date and not being able to update them so I didn't want one.  In comes Chromecast and it was perfect to solve my problems of wanting to watch my apps on TV without it having to be a smart TV.Plugged in, updated, synced to my Ipad and it has worked great since.  Occasionally, it doesn't work right, but it's usually a problem with the Ipad and once I restart the Ipad it connects right up and everything is great.  So it's a small price to pay to be able to use my TV as a smart TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ziare"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Not compatible with any equipment used by the ISPs available in our area.

The Chormecast is still the best TV interface option, but it depends on what you like.The Roku and FireTV stick act more like multimedia centers. They have unique user interfaces, you see the various options on the screen and navigate to your media using the device itself. Both offer remotes for your phone, but they are just that, remotes. The real interaction is happening on the TV.Chromecast is different, its just a bridge, and this is a much, much better design if you are a smartphone user. Everything happens on the phone. You find the show or clip (on anything from Netflix, YouTube, Plex, etc), on your phone, hit play, then look up at the TV. No back-and-forth, everything happens on the phone until it is time to watch it, then it appears on the TV. The native apps for content like Netflix and YouTube are better designed and easier to navigate on a phone than they are on the Roku and FireTV Stick, so Chromecast gets to take advantage of that.It sounds odd to claim that the option with fewer Bells and Whistles is the best, but for this particular use, it's true. If I didn't have a smart phone it would be a different story.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Seth A.
