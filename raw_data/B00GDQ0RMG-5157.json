Also runs pandora, Netflix , and crackle well. Will update with Slingbox performance once I have tested it.  No regrets at all. ouya is now collecting dust.

I also like that I can get other products that I can't get on Sony's platform (Pandora, etc).

The Fire stick seemed the obvious answer - my needs were small, so was the price, so I went for it.Even though I routinely streamed full HD video through each of my other devices, the Fire stick was unable to go for more than 10 seconds of low quality video before having to buffer.  After under a minute of video it made the claim that my internet connection was too slow for streaming.  Really? Because the XBox it is sitting right next to doesn't seem to have a problem... even as I switch between the two of them.  And the XBox is doing HD.  All I can surmise is that whatever wireless stuff it is doing is inferior to what I do elsewhere with my tablet (Surface Pro), which streams fine as I walk around the house.I didn't go after this device for fancy features, integration into a home network, games, etc.  All I wanted was a simple device to watch Amazon videos with.  In that, I can say 'it has failed me for the last time.'Pro:- It is small.- Setup was relatively easy.- The black exterior matches the black of the back of the TV it is hidden behind, and blends in well with the shadows.Con:- It doesn't work for streaming video.

Sometimes I can watch a show with no issues, sometimes playback is choppy and othertimes playback stops. I can use Plex on my Kindle Fire HDX just fine so it is definitely an issue with the Fire TV Stick.A one dimensional streaming stick, performance is lackluster.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Miles D"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this gadget.
