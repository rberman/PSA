We have really bad wifi apparently, so that makes it infuriating when I'm in the middle of a show. But that's not Amazon's fault. The best part is that I can watch almost everything with captions! I couldn't figure out how to do that on my tablet or phone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ariel Dolinar"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Worked great at first, now it won't even connect!
