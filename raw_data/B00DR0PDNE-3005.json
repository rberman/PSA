[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "It is really great;however, my internet is satellite and has a hard time meeting the streaming demands of chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Karen Snodgrass"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I recently purchased the Google Chromecast HDMI as a replacement for my existing wired HDMI chord, The Chromecast is good only for Google related sites and few other online streaming sites like Netflix, Hulu plus and the likes. I chose this device because of it's wireless capabilities, I hate using wires and my old HDMI chord was not working properly. Having said that, the chromecast doesn't allow me to stream anything from my computer as I used to do with the HDMI chord and for me this is a big disappointment for me; I want to be able to stream from my computer without having to go through a browser. I think Google should quickly work on this issue. Until then I won't be recommending this product to anyone of my friends. I am also disappointed that it doesn't allow me to stream my own videos and songs stored on my android phone and Ipad. Google fail to include the lack of these features in their advertisements for the chromecast. I hope someone can bring a similar product to the market with all of these capabilities even if I mean paying a little more for it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "sbdjubor1306"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am behind the tech curve and am trying to get back in front so I bought this and it was too easy to set up.
