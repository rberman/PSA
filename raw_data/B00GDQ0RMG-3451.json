When I received my Fire Stick, the plan was to connect it to my LED TV in our Family Room which is of course on the first floor. My wireless router is located on the second floor in my game/computer room. You'll see why I mention this in a bit.The instructions are easy enough to follow. Connected the HDMI extender to my Fire TV Stick and then the power adapter to it. It powered right up. Everything was fine, until I got to this annoying introduction video. This video lasted about 10 minutes and you can't skip it!! The device comes with a simple instruction booklet so, why do we need to sit through an instruction video that you can't skip if you want? Beats me. Anyway, after the video that lasted for an eternity, I finally got to the point of connecting my Fire TV Stick to my Wifi network. The problem is........... It couldn't connect properly. When it did connect, it would state that it is \"connected with problems\" or, it wouldn't connect at all. This went on for about 20 minutes. Finally, it connected, however everything was slow. So slow, it wasn't worth trying to watch anything on the Sling TV app that I downloaded (which took about 40mins to download). And after a while, it would drop from my network all together. The crazy thing is, all my other devices was connected to my Wifi network from the same spot in the house (Family room) with no issues. Hell, I was able to open the Sling TV app on my iPhone and watch channels with no problem, while my Fire TV Stick couldn't.So, I finally took the Fire TV Stick upstairs to my game room and plugged it into my gaming TV which is right next to the computer desk that has the wireless router on it. It was able to join my wireless network with no issues and Sling TV opened with no problems. In conclusion, you can't be more than 20ft away from your Wireless router. If you are, you will notice connection issues and severe slowness when you do finally connect. I now have my Fire TV Stick in the master bedroom (on the second floor) on my smaller HD TV and I ordered the ROKU 3 Media Streamer to go in the Family room.The Fire Stick is nice, but Amazon needs to get a stronger wireless card in it. When it is working, it is really nice! So, this thing gets 3 stars. I recommend anyone interested in the Amazon Fire TV Stick, to consider the Roku 3500R Streaming Stick. My friend brought it over to my house for testing and it connected to my wireless network just fine from the Family room and performed well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jawan Favors"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I ordered the Fire TV Stick under the impression it did not need a wire connecting it to an outlet.
