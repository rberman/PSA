We've had ours for about 8-9 months now. After about a month it started stalling. It also has frequent errors with apps. It isn't our internet connection. This is directly located next to our router and we recently switched internet companies and the issues haven't gotten any better. I find myself just using the apps on the XBox One to avoid the frustration of this stick's many issues. It even stalls out trying to watch Prime movies. I'm not sure if ours is just defective or if this is a common problem but I wish I would've tried something different. Nice idea.
