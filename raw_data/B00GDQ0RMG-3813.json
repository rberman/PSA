Let's just get that out of the way!However, this thing seems to have stopped working as time goes on. I ordered it right away, and really dug it. The stream was smooth, no connection problems, good picture. Now, a few months later, I have none of those. It rarely connects, and when it does the image freezes for half a second to a couple seconds approximately every 10 seconds! You keep thinking it will go away, but it won't. You can't really get involved in a show with so much stopping.I have my Playstation 3 set up right next to it on the other HDMI outlet, and the PS3 streams better, and has far less connection issues. I don't know if this is just my Stick TV, but right now it's a dud. Also, the wheel is kind of creaky! A slight audible annoyance for those who are easily annoyed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BraMaster"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rose Gesell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fire stick is awesome.

Well, it didn't work because the hotel WiFi changes passwords. So if you want to use it in a hotel, don't bother.  I also had an issue with the way a few of my TVs were set up with the HDMI ports...the angle wouldn't allow the Fire TV stick to go in.  BUT...we found that it will work (and works great) on our 19\" TV in the kitchen.  Once I set it up (which was very easy), we were able to use it right away.  My mom, who is technologically retarded, has mastered how to use it...so that is saying something about its ease of use.  She has been able to get caught up on her Downton Abbey program.I highly recommend the product.  The set up is the same as the Fire TV box and is quick and easy.  The only real difference between the two is the remote doesn't have the voice recognition piece, but I rarely use it...and you can type in what you are looking for.  So if you are a Amazon Prime and Netflix (or Hulu Plus) user, I would definitely recommend this product.  Just be sure to check that your HDMI ports have straight on access.  My TVs were curved, so it prevented the stick from going in for the bigger TVs, but no problem with the Fire TV box.  Also, forget about using it on hotel TVs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "scompto"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great media device, works well.

The Fire TV stick sure does deliver at a more than fair price tag.  My only gripe on the newer devices is the lack of Infrared Support.  I believe in this case it's my fault for not staying with the times.The Fire TV Stick is fast and speedy.  You can also restart the device with out unplugging it like other set top boxes that are in this category.  Simply hold the center button and the play button for a few seconds.
