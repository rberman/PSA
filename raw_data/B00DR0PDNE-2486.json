Both work great. Slowly adding to the compatible apps, but since you can use them right off of Chrome, not in a rush for more apps. All the basic apps are pretty much covered. And for the price? No-brainer! Get one...or a few!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "AJP"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I absolutely love the convenience of this little dongle.

The picture quality is amazing, it's fast and easy to use, and it's compatible with all of our devices. We originally bought it because we wanted a small LED tv for our bedroom but the smallest one with WiFi was a little pricey. We chose a smaller one without the WiFi and got Chromecast to supplement and it's been an amazing purchase. My only complaint about it is that you can't watch a series of shows on Netflix, i.e. you can't just let it roll. It will only play one episode at a time. I'm not sure if that's a Chromecast issue or a Netflix issue but if it's a Netflix one, Chromecast gets full stars from us.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Heather A. Robertson \"hrob\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Item seems to function as described and when it works, it works nicely (the concept). However, the connection keeps dropping and I can't get a movie going from a tablet to TV for more than 1 min. Very annoying!!! I never had any issues with my wireless connection of dropping signal and I use 2 computers at the same time and same location as the TV with the Chromecast. It would be a heck of a deal for the price if it worked. Since it doesn't, I can't use it and wasted 35 bucks. At least I tried before purchasing a more reliable equipment to broadcast from computer to TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Dan M"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Gave this to my son for Christmas and he reports that he loves it.. he can now watch videos through his computer, iPad or phone on his flat screen TV.  His only complaint is that you have to connect it to power so it takes up another outlet on your powerstrip... he uses it often and for the price you really can't find anything else like it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Steve Axworthy"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This works perfectly for my wife and I.
