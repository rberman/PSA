Streaming uses our internet data usage quickly so we have had to up that usage which is costing about $25 more a month.  We were trying the Fire Stick so we could decrease our Direct TV bill, but as you can see that might be a wash.  We are still experimenting, although we find the movie channels on Direct TV don't have much to watch on a regular basis so the Fire Stick does give a lot more options.  We are finding some of the movies we want to watch on the Stick can not be streamed, but to rent them is cheaper than Pay per view.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "schrek"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Worked just as stated.
