I was so excited to get the 2 I pre-ordered that I went ahead and sold my Roku stick as I could buy both of these for what I got out of my Roku.  My main use for these would be Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and Watch ESPN (live streaming).  I eagerly installed this just in time to watch a college basketball game on ESPN3.  I've been using ESPN3 flawlessly on my Roku.  The Fire TV stick was a different story.  Streaming would buffer at least every 30 seconds and it closed out on me on multiple occasions.  I thought maybe I had a bad unit, so I set up my other fire stick.  This one, I put in my living room, within about 15 feet from my router.  The same problem occurred.  I was so disappointed not only in this product that I had eagerly anticipated but also in the fact that I sold my Roku stick.  I will be returning and re-ordering Roku sticks.I will note that Amazon streaming content and Netflix streamed just fine in the limited time that I used these.The thing that really bothered me was how much these sticks were bogging down my network while they were idle not streaming anything on my TV's.  The background buffering of Amazon content must consume large amounts of bandwidth.  The interface is quick and nice looking, but to me its not worth the negatives.  I thought these were a steal at $19, but now I'm ready to admit my mistake and make things right again for me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/6", "author": "CG- Illinois"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Does great job...everything i wanted", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "LARRY WAYNE PORTER"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Wifi performance is not good.  Only Amazon content is stable, Hulu regularly stutters (not a problem on the ATV2 in the same room) and Plex is so slow it's almost unusable.  I like the interface and remote, but if it doesn't stream well what's the point?  For $19, it's a nice cheap way to view Amazon content only, at $39 I'd say you'd be better to spend the money to get a fully functional box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "T.

I have several devices that connect to my network without issue, but the stick will no longer even recognize an available network to which it can connect.

My review is more on the FireTV stick Vs Roku Stick. I have the regular fireTV as well and the user interface / GUI is almost identical. the FireTV and the FireTV Stick looked very smooth when navigating through the menus. Its actually hard to tell the two apart based on the user interface. I use PLEX heavily on both the FireTV stick and the Roku Stick. I think this is  where is where the FireTV Stick falls a little short of the Roku stick. I am able to stream uncompressed 1080p bluray mkv using the Roku Stick. On the FireTV stick, I cant. it starts to stutter. I also tested using a 2.4ghz wifi (which was literally right next to both the Roku Stick and the FireTV stick) and a dual band 5ghz wifi access point. The only time I can stream the 1080p uncompressed mkv file smoothly on my firetv stick is if I put the 5ghz wifi access point i have right next to my FireTV stick. I tried streaming that same uncompressed 1080p mkv using a 2.4ghz accesspoint and it couldnt keep up even if the access point was right next to the FireTV stick. I am however able to stream other 1080p MKV's thats been compressed to about 10 to 15gb to my FireTV stick with out a problem. On the other hand, the Roku Stick was able to stream ALL my 1080p mkv's with no issues. uncompressed, compressed, on 2.4 ghz or on 5ghz. i'm guessing it the Roku stick does a better job at caching / buffering the videos..Hope this helps others out who intend to use PLEX to stream mkv videos to their FireTV stick", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Charlie C"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!
