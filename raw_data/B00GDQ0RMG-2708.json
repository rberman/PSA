It is extremely quick and easy to set up and you are ready to go in minutes.  Now let's look at some facts here...Pros:- Quick and easy setup- Easy navigation- Fire TV Remote Control App provides excellent- Excellent suite of streaming apps (Netflix, HBO Go, Showtime Anytime, Plex)- Sideloading for the adventurousCons:- Apps are slow to install/load the first time (after that they are plenty fast)- Fire TV Remote Control App functionality only extends to the main menu and Amazon-specific sub-menus. Netflix, for example, cannot be voice searched.- Remote is very small and easy to lose- Battery compartment is tough to get open (you feel like you're about to break it)- Initial setup puts games in your face but they require separate controller.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mass Daddy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy set up and it runs very well.
