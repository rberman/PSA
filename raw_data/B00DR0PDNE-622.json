[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this device! It was easy to install and it works perfectly for what I need it to. I primarily use it to cast Netflix but it also works great with Youtube and other video-streaming websites that I've tried (like Nick Jr. and Creative Live). I only wish that I could cast from my VLC Media Player program and then it would be absolutely amazing. As is, I'm extremely impressed with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "forhislove"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome device! works everywhere.
