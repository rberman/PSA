[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Im loving this fire tv. Has so much to offer. Seames to be fast enouph for me. My only beef is the usb port. Not sure what I can use it for. It doesnt read my media. But then I havnt tryed my sticks yet. Dont think it can read my file formats.I still have to use, my wd live media players. Thats a bother. More to plug in. But I really am liking fire tv. Hope the price doesnt shoot up soon. Having prime is also very cool. I buy a lot of things from amazon. The free 2 day shipping is great,  I dont have to wait untill I have $35 to get free shipping.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "evie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "very satisfied", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "vione"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I thought there would have been a wider range of movies.

This replaced the access to Netflix I was getting through my blu-ray player which was, at best, slow and clunky, and prone to failing at inconveient moments - as a signficant side benefit, the accessto Amazon Prime material is also very nice and something which previously was restricted to my PC only (couldn't get thee via my blu-ray player). The voice search works surprisingly well, but only if you know what you're looking for - if you want to browse a category, you can't say something like \"westerns\" ( let alone \"westerns between 1965-1980\") and get a list to review.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "T.

You cannot change the video quality. So if your bandwidth can handle HD then HD it is. We blew through our ISP's 500GB cap in 18 days and has cost me an extra $50.00 for my internet.Amazon a word of advice. Take a page from Netflix's rule book.
