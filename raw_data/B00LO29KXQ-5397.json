[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Sometimes we experience glitches from it, it will delay playing videos or shows or pause in the middle to load, and sometimes it will not open an app because of a malfunction so we have to restart it.  Also we were unaware it somehow syncs photos from your phone and displays them on the TV as a screensaver. It's a cool feature but not if you don't want your pictures displayed on tv!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A Jenkins"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love love love this addition to amazon", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very wow.

The Pandora interface (as well as other interfaces) are very basic looking. The apps are limited and there is currently no remote control app available for iphone.
