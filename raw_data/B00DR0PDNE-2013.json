However, since it only has WIFI connectivity (and a crappy slow one at that), I get a lot of stuttering playback with Plex streaming. Lowering streaming quality helps some but doesn't prevent the issue completely.My plex server machine is beefy with plenty of speed for transcoding (transcodes 6 times faster than required). So it's definitely the wifi connectivity of this device. Not suited for Plex streaming, which is the main reason I use it. I had to switch back to my Roku 3, which streams plex flawlessly because I hardwire it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Robert"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is an amazing device.
