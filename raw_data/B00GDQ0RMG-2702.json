[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I didn't realize this needed to be plugged in to the outlet in order to work.  Part of the reason I bought it was because it was so small but now I have a cord hanging down from my tv.  Also the cord is way too short and I need to use an extension cord!

I have a subscription to Hulu Plus but you wanted me to down load an app then charge me more per episode.  Do you ever think that some people might be on a low budget??", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "corinne cisneros"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I have mixed feelings about this. When it actually WORKS, it's great! It offers a nice selection of apps, it's easy to use, and it's a good substitute for paying for cable. The issue is,  IT NEVER WORKS. I can get it to work maybe 30% of the time? I constantly reboot it, and I even leave it completely off and unplugged overnight and it still doesn't work. It's not a wifi issue, as it's less than 3 feet from my modem. It even says under settings that it has a \"very strong\" connection, and yet nothing will load. It always says \"please check network settings\" but the network settings say it's fine! Restarting the apps and rebooting the system doesn't fix it. I mostly use it for Netflix and hulu; hulu sometimes will work when netflix won't but most of the time neither of them work.
