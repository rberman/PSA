My family was using our wii for Netflix. It took forever to load and the Xbox would cut out wifi signal. This hasn't done any of that. We used to think our internet was screwed up but this has excellent options for different streaming apps and the prime movie options are very good. We just purchased another one for our other TV and have down graded our cable service. It is very easy to use and picture is crisp and clear. Even older shows look great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mary W"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "YUNJUNG KIM"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Lots of options.

I bought this during the Prime member special before the item was released. This also was purchased to replace my Chromecast. Let me just say it did just that!The operating system works great and is very easy to use. You can buy/download apps on the device and most work just fine. The nicest part about it is that you can even get an app on your phone/tablet to make it a controller too.During the time I have been using the device I have had only twice where it refused to work properly and it had to be unplugged and reset. And the two times this happened was after an extended time of no use (2-4 weeks).This device really amazes me at how well a simple flash drive sized stick can perform. If you use Plex, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus etc. this is the device for you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David McCahon"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "nice", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "allen dorsey tripp"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Does not let you log into your Netflix account without paying extra for Prime!Don't buy to view Netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BK"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "great when used", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "william"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it it works great,I have Amazon Prime and I also get hundreds of movies free love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lynn Wells"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought this for my bedroom so I could connect to the internet on my TV - love how easy it was to set up and how easy it is to navigate between the apps.This is my first time owning something like this and I heard great things about the Fire TV, but I did not want something else to clutter my bedroom, so the TV stick solved that problem real quick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Danielle Ski"}]
