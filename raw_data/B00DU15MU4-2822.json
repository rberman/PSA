[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Great product. Definitely fastest in the market.We need more apps. I got this device hoping I could put MLB.tv and various other services on it. I read that these would be provided 'eventually' and made the poor decision in thinking that, since they were mentioned, they would be completed relatively soon. I've yet to see any progress on the Fire TV app store.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Thomas"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "First, this is a great addition to viewing TV. It is very easy to set up, the voice recognition works well, and is ridiculously fast compared to my ROKU -- which I spend more time waiting for it to load than watching content. It deserves a 5 Star rating for that.However -- at this time -- there is no way to load the TED Talks app. You can't load it from the Fire TV on-screen interface, and it won't load from \"manage your devices\" when you download the app from the Amazon app store. Granted, the TED Talk app will load to your Kindle Fire device, but not to your Kindle Fire TV.Amazon customer service says this is a problem in TED's court, not an Amazon issue. That may be the case, but why didn't Amazon talk to TED before launching Fire TV?Although I am glad to be rid of my ROKU, at least I could watch TED talks with it....well, at least when it wasn't loading that is.You will love the Fire TV, just as long as you don't want to watch TED talks. Let's hope the the TED app is available soon! I will be happy to give the star back...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sci Guy"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "They still have to do some tweaks in the interface- such as if one cant connect to the internet some of the instructions for troubleshooting are circular and sometimes do not allow you to get to the network settings.

This is an Android based device, there's and Android app for Amazon MP3, it can't be that hard.

Setup was so very easy (I have Prime) and Love the way you only have to press the enter button to turn on everything. Not only does Fire TV power on, but the Source selection on my TV automatically switches to Fire TV, making access immediate. The only negative so far is that Fire TV is so new that Netflix isn't synced to the remote's menu yet, so I can't turn on captions. I have a call into Netflix to see if there is a workaround but I'm sure that Netflix will be ready soon. Using with Amazon Prime is top notch, seamless, and easy-as-pie.
