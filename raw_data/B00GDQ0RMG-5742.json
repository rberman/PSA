I do not have expectations other than what they are described as being capable of doing.  While the Netflix and Hulu apps run alright, the live streaming apps (WatchESPN) are junk.  I have 50 Mbps internet and never have interruptions when I run WatchESPN through my Chromecast but with the Fire TV stick it is constantly losing connection.  I re-started my router and modem 10 times, made sure I had the latest firmware, and did my best to give this a chance, but it keeps cutting out every 20-30 seconds.Needless to say, I am back to streaming from the laptop through my Chromecast.  I am extremely disappointed.  If all you want is to run paid subscriptions on your TV, this works OK, but I would get a Chromecast and run it through a laptop instead.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "Steve Anderson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It fir d", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rusty B \"Rusty\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have not had tv for 15 years (there's never anything good on!), but it has gotten to be a hassle to stream everything from my Mac.

Haven't gotten Amazon Prime yet, I use Netflix and Hulu, but plan to get Prime.  Remote control easy to use... haven't found how to 'search' on Netflix yet, but over all... very cool.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michelle Young"}]
