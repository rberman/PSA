I am a person who isn't even remotely tech savvy but the fire stick was as easy to set up as plugging in your cell phone to the wall charger.  Very simple directions and since I was already a prime member it immediately loaded up knowing who I was and pulled all of my movies and pictures from my Kindle.  Its super simple to navigate even without watching the cute cartoon at the set up.  I started downloading different apps right away and spent a good portion of the night ignoring my family while I watched You Tube videos of crazy cats on my big screen TV.  I wanted this to be able to watch my Prime TV shows and movies without having to watch them on my Kindle (I love the Outlander books and purchased season 1 to watch in HD and on a larger screen.)  I highly recommend the Fire Stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Amazon Fire Stick was eazy to use.
