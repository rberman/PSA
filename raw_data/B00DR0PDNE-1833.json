I have an HTPC and an Office PC attached to two (2) TVs and prefer the chromecasts for internet streaming (they are that good that I got a second one!). I pay for cable, however, I do not have any STBs in the house  (I use the android app to watch tv). So I needed some type of streamer less complicated than having to open a web browser, a wireless keyboard to type in the netflix search box. Now I can use my Galaxy SIII phone to cast netflix, cast the watchESPN app, etc. There are a few disconnects with the WatchESPN but not a deal breaker and I did not take a star out as I don't think is the chromecast (none with netflix or HBO go). Make sure you have a dual band wireless router if you want to cast local HD content from your android phone with either allcast or localcast (telcon provided wireless router did not work for me, solved the issue with a new router that had 5GHz band set to 80 wideband).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Chromecast is awesome!
