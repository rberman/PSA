The chromecast doesn't do anything that ROKU can't do, It was not user friendly and quite frankly my ROKU is much easier to use.

Super cheap and has a pretty decent wifi capabilities to stream HD content from the existing apps.BUT, if you want this primarily to mirror your browser or entire desktop (yes, you can do that with this device except the audio), this product is in serious beta stage. I tried to cast Hulu (not plus) and the audio was fine but the video was not HD at all. Same with Netflix. I was excited about their Beta feature of casting the entire desktop but realized that in that case the video is pretty decent, but it does not cast the audio to the TV speakers.If Google keeps updating the apps and the hardware, I will definitely give their version 2.0 another chance.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alpha Nancy"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Too few apps to even use it. Cannot use it like Apple TV to beam my photo or movies or even music to the TV. Lucky only buy 1pcs. So will not recommend to anyone , Buy it and now I use once and total a waste of money. Buy Apple TV its many many times better then this unit.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Dennis Tan"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It really gives a new meaning to youtube. The device size is very small which makes it very easy to use. I used to have a HDMI cable for watching youtube in TV. But this changes it. Now I don't have any cable. Which makes my room clean.Only disadvantage is it does not support all. I think google is working on it and they will come up some solution soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Avijit Nayek"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "When I ordered Chromecast I thought I would be able to view my photos and videos on my tv.

Now with Chromecast, I can ditch the cord...only for internet related streaming at least. I love being able to move my laptop around without worrying about yanking the HDMI cord out of the TV or laptop. However, it would be nice if it allowed streaming for other PC functionalities, such as, Word Processing, Saved photos, PPT, etc. It also needs tab streaming from smartphone or tablet. Otherwise, it's still a good product worth buying.Update (5/5/2014): I recently noticed that Chromecast now has a BETA test for streaming your entire desktop to the TV. It works good but has some lag. Hopefully it gets better as they continue to test it out.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "CocoComplexion \"SexyNavy\""}]
