Super Annoying!  Because I can never watch anything! But amazon is working with me to attempt to fix the problem. So thats why it gets a 3 star. Plus Hulu only gets 1 star because 3 ADS INTERUPTING every 7 to 10 mins of watching shows, slowing down, stopping, because of abrupt ADS!!!! its amazing how the ADS don't slow down, stop, or kick me off!

Mostly Roku. The fire stick is OK. I like the layout. But it has issues with keeping connected to my wireless network. It sits about 5 feet from the router and for some reason it just slows down to a crawl and everything starts to buffer. So I have to restart the device then it starts to work OK again for a while. The Roku LT that it replaced never had any issue like that. Maybe I just got a bad one, IDK. But if it keep up I will probably just go out and get another Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kristin D."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Pretty dope little guy.
