I would prefer to pay an additional $200 annually for total selection of free movies. The Amazon price for movie rentals is higher than the Red Box movie rental service. As the weather gets better and I have a desire to rent a movie, at this point, I think that I will be using the Red Box movie rental service.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "The old one"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice product.

I watch a lot of netflix on it. One thing that I have noticed about it is that it needs to load a lot. Several times per episode of shows I watch. It really doesn't take long for it to finish loading, but it can be a slight inconvenience. My boyfriends mom came over while I was using it and she noticed that it was doing that and she said that hers does that as well. Also, I have used mine in different places with different internet providers and it does it everywhere I have used it so I do not believe that is the issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tonya"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was easy to hook up and gives lots of viewing options, a good investment", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "paul miller"}]
