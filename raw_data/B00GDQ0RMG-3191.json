There is no lag whatsoever for anything.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "matthew r rhoades"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This is a replacement for the first one that ran very hot and locked up in mid show, requiring power down to reboot.  This second one hasn't done that but it is messing up the TV somehow.  Interferes with audio on normal broadcast channel (we don't have cable). and sometimes pixelates the screen...so there is some type of feedback via the USB connection.  That all stops if I unplug it.  The Fire stick portion works fine, and gives HD TV, but it troubles me that it is a messing  with the basic broadcast signal too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dan K."}]
