[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "When it works it works well. Initial setup was easy. But way too often my device does not recognize the Chromecast on the network. It's been more frustration than it's worth.In retrospect, I should have paid up for a Roku instead.  It's annoying to have to control the pause through the iPad. Whenever I want to pause, I need to powerup the ipad, swipe the screen, sometimes enter a password, wait for the application to load.  So, unless you're willing to have your device on the whole time, it might take 10-15 seconds just to hit a pause button.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "V Ember \"V\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We received the Chromecast, and I \"installed\" it. I put quotes around \"installed\" because I basically just plugged it in and then named it. It did everything else automatically. I can play Youtube, Netflix, my Photo Gallery, Movies off my phone, Pandora, etc just by pressing the little broadcast icon that pops up. When I'm not using it, and leave the HDMI channel on, it has a slideshow of beautiful photography. Also, if I choose to broadcast when the TV is off, it will turn the TV on and play whatever I'm broadcasting. Great product, I highly recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dingo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT...

My 7 year old can cast from his nexus 7 with ease and so can I! Use it all the time with Netflix. In fact we bought a new TV and didn't get a \"smart TV\" as we knew we could get a chromcast for it and pay way less! Want more apps!
