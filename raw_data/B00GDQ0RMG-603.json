[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Although the fire stick was very easy to set up, I was disappointed in the number of features that were not free.  Also disappointed that more TV series were not available or came with exorbitant fees.  I purchased the stick with the intention of cutting my cable bill by almost 70%.  But there isn't enough free content to make this possible.It's a freebee with Prime, but I wouldn't buy the service if it wasn't free.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kyoko"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great device", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ignacio Ybarra"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my firestick!
