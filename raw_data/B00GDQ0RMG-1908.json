I regularly have to wait for simple tasks to complete and it becomes irritating after a while, we have two of these and one regular Fire TV unit, I prefer the regular unit for it's \"snappiness\", the regular unit just seems to be a lot more responsive with intensive apps like Plex and Sling.You can't really power it off the USB from your television set either, the processor slows to a crawl when under powered and Amazon recommends the unit be plugged in directly to a power outlet when you try to power it via TV USB.Had I known that from the beginning I might have just stuck with the regular Fire TV units, the price lured me in and they function well, just not as well as I had really expected or needed. I am still a huge fan of Amazon's original electronics and I see great value in the quality build and power inside of most their products but this one fell short in the usefulness department for me.Let me know if I was able to help you. ;)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mat C."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great stick...
