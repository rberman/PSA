Within a few minutes of un-boxing the unit, I had it updating with the newest version of the software. The hardest thing for me was getting the battery cover off of the remote to install the batteries.After a little investigation on the internet, it was so easy to add apps like tvmc and kodi to the unit as well as some games and other apps.Trust me, it's well worth the cost for a low price media center for your tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jon Dubin"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Greater than what I expected.

Who wants to do it twice? Amazon thinks we all do. Immediately after connecting it downloaded an update and wiped the login.Then on to type in amazon credentials.And now I am forced to watch a tutorial I don't care about.On to the phone app, to get keyboard access. Another forced tutorial to watch. Then you just get a blank area to swipe back and forth. This is awful,  because it behaves like arrow buttons but you are forced to swipe. If its not going to be a fluid motion or a mouse-like cursor,  why not just copy the physical remote? Making a touch screen move a mouse cursor is called a touch pad,  ever heard of it? I found myself holding both together; remote for selecting and phone for keyboard.And then of course you get fire apps (like PBS) which don't recognize the keyboard. I blame this squarely on amazon. Samsung also left this up to the developers and it is a disaster for the user. But what do you care,  I already bought the hardware, right? In every OS when a developer outs in a text box the OS takes care of the rest. It's not rocket science! Oh,  and no HBO Go,  even though Showtime's thing is there.In the end, this is the same old junk everyone else is making. Amazon missed a great opportunity to actually beat the competition.

Netflix on Apple TV, plugged into the same TV set, are crystal clear HD.Problem #2: Amazon deliberately misleads you to think there is no power cord and brick needed. All their photos of the product, including of it plugged into the back of a TV, show no power cord. And the descriptions lie by omission. No power cord mentioned. They want you to think you just plug it into the TV and it works. That's false advertising by omission. This product required a power cord and USB brick.Problem #3: Amazon designed the product so you can NOT use it right away after you plug it in. They instead force you to watch a cartoon character spend 5 minutes explaining how you use the product and spend money on Amazon Prime. If you try to go skip past this obnoxious tutorial the product will not work and it punishes you by starting the tutorial from the beginning.I might have lived with problems #2 and #3 but #1 was fatal.

That lasted about 5 minutes after plugging it in and finding it having connectivity issues.  Chalking it up to bogged servers (given it release day), gave it some time and, after a few hours, everything leveled out.Getting it functional is not why I bought the thing.  It was to replace/compete w/ my ChromeCast/Roku/XBMC.  And, it fails miserable.Example one, boot up PLEX to test streaming a movie.  Not only can it not handle it (choppy/freezing), the quality is much worse than my other devices with the same video/network!  Even Spotify Connect (b/c the full Spotify app isn't available on Amazon devices) wouldn't work correct.  It kept kicking the audio back to the controlling device.2nd, the interface is awful.  I side loaded an application (XBMC) and to open it, you have to go under 'settings', 'manage applications', 'XBMC', theeeen open.  There is no 'pin to home' or anything.  No customization whatsoever.Having 3 Roku's and a Chromecast, I would take those devices over this thing regardless of price.  Knock this thing down to $5 and it's what you should be paying.Going to return.  Huge disappointment :(", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "11/16", "author": "Chris"}]
