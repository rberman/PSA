As a member of Amazon Prime it is great to watch some of the good movies in Prime Video.  You can also listen to music via TV/ entertainment system.  The apps let me watch one of my favorite talk shows and I imagine will continue to create different ways to watch TV.  I can't wait until they figure out how to put local News channels on and then GOOD BYE cable!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alex in Springfield"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "best thing I ever bought.love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nancy Glover"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love it  planning on buying another one for our daughters ro", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patricia Kubicek"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jason"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lawrence Gill"}]
