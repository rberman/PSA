I an a subscriber to Dish TV, and the Dish wires are plugged into my Samsung tv in the  port in the back marked 1 so I had to put the Fire Stick on port 2 , by doing this I need the Dish remote , the Samsung tv remote and the Fire Stick remote do I need to use 3 remotes for different functions to operate the FireStock.  I need the Samsung remote to change source from Port 1 ( Dish tv) to source port 2 to activate FireStick, then the Dish remote for volume control. I am quite sure there may be a fix for this bUT I don't know if it is something Amazon can tell me how to fix or I need to contact Dish TV about a fix. I know I need the FireStick remote for Fire tv, 9 just wish I needed to use only 1 more remote for the rest of my needs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard Martin"}]
