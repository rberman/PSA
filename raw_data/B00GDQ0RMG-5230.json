[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Solid unit. Very simple to set up. Smooth streaming. I have not found any CONS that have anything to do with the unit itself.My only problem has been with MY Cable Service Provider: Comcast/Infinty.They don't allow access to many of the Apps available on the Firestick. (History Channel, Showtime, etc.)Since you pay for these thru your Cable Service Provider, when you try to access these apps, they ask you to sync/activate with your service provider via computer. There's a large list (drop down menu) of service providers. Unfortunately, Comcast/Infinity isn't one of them.Again, not an Amazon problem ... I blame Comcast.But if you are a Prime Member, you can't go wrong with this item. My library comes right up.
