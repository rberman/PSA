Not sure if it was because everyone and their mother were downloading the update, but it was slow! I received 2 of these in the mail. I installed on both TV's that I have. Here are the pro's and con'sPros:* I have all my favorite apps, like Netflix, iHeartRadio, and so on.* Great WiFi range. I was able to connect in both rooms no problem. the Chromecast had issues.* You can play games! woohoo* Love Amazon Music.* Super quick when not running an appCons:* Sometimes it runs slow, however, it could be the apps I am running.* Slow downloading updates* Amazon music doesn't have their stations on fire tv yet :(* Can not install the fire tv app on my Fire HD 7!!! WTH* Can't Mirror your device(See below EDIT2)All in all I really like it. I feel like it is better than Chromecast. However, I still have not tried out a few things, like the mirror screen. I would also like to mirror my computer screen. I do not think this does it, as i didn't see an option for that.For $40, it is worth it if you stream your movies/TV/music and play games.######EDIT:Just some updates. Not sure if an issue with everyone but it is recommended to plug the power cord into the wall, instead of the USB on the side of the TV. I do believe it just needs more power to run the processor. The length of the power cord looks to be only 6 feet long, which is kind of short to me. On my one TV it was fine, the other one, I had to do some stretching!I will update when I do some mirroring from device to TV######EDIT2:I have yet to get the mirroring to work on ANY of my devices. I have the Nexus 7(2013), Samsumg Galaxy S5, and the Fire HD 7. All did not connect. They acted like they were going to, but didn't. I am dropping the rating down another star because of this. it is advertised to work and it doesn't. I tried restarting device and router to make sure everything was running at optimal performance. Also, i noticed that my WiFi on one of my devices gets weak. they are both connected to the outlet, so they should have enough power. I may have to go back to google chromecast for my mirroring. plus i can mirror chrome on desktop with chromecast. I'm just a bit disappointed that this feature doesn't work :(######EDIT3:So I gave my other fire stick to my parents. They love it, as they just use it for streaming on netflix. They were using the Wii before, so this was sooooo much better to use. better UI. So if you need a streaming stick, this is it 5 stars. However, if you are a super user like me, it lacks in a few area's to make it a chromecast killer.Do note, that this is the first version, and only a week into using it. So, software and hardware updates may change this little device, and make it even better for super users! Until then, 3 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Joshua Pack"}]
