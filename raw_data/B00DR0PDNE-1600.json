[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "This product was great for several months until one day I tried to cast and got the message \"No cast devices found.\" which has happened before (just unplug it and plug it back in), but now it will no longer power on. So now 9 months or so after purchase my receipt has faded to a blank piece of paper and because I purchased it at a local (Google Authorized) retailer and paid cash I am SOL because both the retailer and Google's warranty require proof of purchase for an exchange which is long gone. I don't know if I'll buy another streaming device to replace it but from now on I'll stick with Google's software and avoid their hardware.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Brandon Link"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy with my purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Dean W Roberts"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Live Google chrome. I don't have a smart TV so I bought this and it's awesome. I have 2 one in my room and one in my family room. If my sister is watching in the family room, sometimes I mess with her and pause or forward what she is watching since it's controlled from a phone, tablet or computer. Great investment,  worth buying if you don't have a smart TV and want to be able to watch Netflix or HBO GO or other providers on your tv. Easy set up. Easy to use.

Super easy set up. You can broadcast anything in a Chrome browser (PC only!) tab onto the TV. (The ONLY thing I found you can't see is Quicktime videos, but that's an Apple thing...)  And I know a lot of people are wondering, it DOES work on adult web sites, and will go full-screen if a particular video player has the option. It's very Flash/HTML5 friendly!Also use apps on my Android tablet to control it.  There are many apps to even broadcast videos stored on your computer or Android device.  The standards are all there, Netflix, Hulu, HBO-Go, etc...My set-up is a 50Down/10Up Mbps internet connection, with Linksys Wireless-G router in the same room, and Chromecast settings set to \"Extreme\". Doesn't skip a beat!I'm super happy, and it's worth every penny for me.
