My Roku 2 feels slow and sluggish so I was looking for an upgrade.It's much faster than the Roku 2, however, I'm disappointed in the channel selection, especially news sources.  Probably will buy a Roku 3 and ditch this.Also I'm a lifetime Plex Pass owner.  I was quite annoyed to find they want another $5 for the Fire TV app which is getting lack luster reviews, so I'm not sure I'll purchase that and go back to the Roku 2 until I purchase the 3.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "L.
