No issues with wifi reception in the room, yet it could not connect to the network time and time again.  It may have something to do with it's size and proximity to the TV when hooking up to the HDMI port due to interference, but I couldn't get it to work for the life of me and the included documentation and troubleshooting provided absolutely nothing to address the issue.  Plus I soon realized the functionality is pretty lacking considering other devices currently on the market.  It was probably best to not be an early adopter in this case and to wait for the later model and/or upgrades to improve wifi reception.  I really wanted to like it, but it's just not very intuitive or useful.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S.
