The picture is awesome and has a solid Wi-Fi connectivaty. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I have not been able to put vudu on it and I have spent close to $2000 in movies and still can't watch them in my bedroom. If it is possible to have the vudu app. On it please let me know and will definitely go back and give 5 stars!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "punto de oro"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "unit works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris Bearden"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy install.
