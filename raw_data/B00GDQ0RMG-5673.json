Not so smart.  Slow, cumbersome, not terribly reliable.Chromecast:  Quick setup, tons of options, reliable (after updates over the last year; initially, not so much)... only frustration is that it's missing the ability to natively cast movies from Amazon Prime :\\.  And with a lot of the recent (Dec 2014) promotions, it's essentially free if you include various Play store credits, Play Music free months, Hulu + free months, etc.Fire stick:  Quick setup, reasonable number of options, reliable (so far), and a bargain at $19 (early pricing).  Android app is pretty wonky, though, and makes it WAY too easy to accidentally buy stuff given the poor navigation UX.  And I don't really see any advantages to the Fire stick over the Chromecast other than the ability to cast Amazon Prime movies.Bottom line:  If you're heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem, you'll likely find the Fire Stick to be quite handy and useful, and its usability (aside from the Android app) is pretty admirable.But if you don't have (or plan to get) an Amazon Prime subscription, I'd suggest trying the Chromecast first.DISCLAIMER:  I work for Google *but* don't work on anything remotely related to the Chromecast and the opinions above are mine, not my employer's :).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adam Lasnik \"Frim Fram Sauce Extraordinaire\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Current best TV stick out there", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "X.
