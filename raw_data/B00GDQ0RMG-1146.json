I so want to give this 5 stars. I love that I can watch TV for about $35/month instead of the $150 I used to pay Comcast (we have Sling w/ HBO). But, I can't give it all my stars since  have to reboot the thing all the time, especially when using Sling or the PBS app.These are what we primarily use with the Stick--it can be frustrating. Please update the firmware. I have a similar request for Sling.On a happy note, I am glad that I no longer have to dedicate my laptop to HDMI or Chromecast when I want to watch a movie or show on Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
