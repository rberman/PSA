[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "What a neat little thing. I really enjoy it. I'd give it five stars except it doesn't handle streaming video from a Chrome tab well. The sound is delayed so it's just too awkward to watch. Stuff like Netflix works great though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Reviewer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Concept is very neat but this device is not for basic everyday content streamers. I prefer a device that is not dependent on a smartphone app to initiate streaming. For example if I had a younger sibling or older relative who wanted to watch Netflix they would be required to start \"casting\" (streaming content to television) through Netflix for smartphones or through chrome on a computer vs other devices with standalone interfaces that can be navigated through entirely on screen with a remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jose"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works as advertised. Had a small issue with my router where I would need to reset the router if the Chromecast was turned off. Something to do with the dynamic/static IP setting. Other than that works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adrian Haye"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "In love with this device! I owned an Apple TV but I have an older version Mac without the airplay feature so it wasn't as useful as I'd hoped it would be.  Chromecast is exactly what I've been looking for in terms of functionality.  Between the available apps and several websites (while browsing on my phone (LG G3) or tablet (Nexus 7 2013 running 5.0 Lollipop)) having the \"Casting\"option built-in for video play back this device is awesome in my opinion.  Before you purchase make sure to research what it is you want to do with your Chromecast and how to accomplish those things and avoid reading some reviews by people who obviously don't know how to use it.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Working great on my Sansung note tablet, watching Netflix movies on my TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Does exactly what it says on the box.
