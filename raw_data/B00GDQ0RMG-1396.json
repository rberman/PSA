It occasionally will stutter but that depends on how long it's been up since a restart and also the service I'm streaming. Extremely responsive to commands using the remote, quicker to navigate than anything I've used before. The content options are great if you have a Prime membership but that's not required which is pretty cool. If you could adjust volume from the remote this would be just about perfect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "B.
