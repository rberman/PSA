Downside vs. the fire tv box, it is noticeably slower, and the remote it comes with is not quite as awesome.  Otherwise, like I said, amazing value, it does everything the full box can do.  I also plan to take this with us on the road so hotel rooms and grandma's house can also have my kid's shows readily available.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian F"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my Fire TV Stick......binge watching as I type this :)  Works great....setup easy....no problems!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Many reviews states that the interface was slow but to be honest, I don't think it is.

Everything in my house is running fine off the wifi...except this!!! It looks promising when its first plugged in.
