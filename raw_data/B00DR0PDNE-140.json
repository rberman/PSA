This is great for sharing videos, pictures, a computer screen onto your tv. It's easy and works well. Also with new apps there's access to netflix and many more service as well as chromecast games! The games are fun and improving slowly to have fun multiplayers games, by downloading the app on a smart phone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "hellocow"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Chromecast is pretty sweet. Plug it into your TV, use an app to cast to your TV and you're watching pretty much anything you want. The setup was quite easy and overall, the experience has been smooth. I have had issues casting my Netflix to Chromecast, which is one of my most used apps. However customer service provided me with a work around and things have improved.

We are an apple family, and you just can\u2019t do much with Chromecast with an apple device. I should have researched it a bit more before buying. I didn\u2019t realize that you can\u2019t \u201cmirror\u201d with an iPhone, iPod, or iPad (all of which I have). You can cast from the normal apps (Netflix,  YouTube\u2026.ext. but I can already get these on my tv and don\u2019t need the Chromecast to do it for me) however you can\u2019t just mirror a webpage or app. This is what I wanted Chromecast for. I have several exercise apps that I wanted to be able to watch on my TV rather than the small screen on my phone. So I have had Chromecast for two weeks and have yet to use it. But like I said, I will keep it just in case. It wasn\u2019t expensive and maybe I\u2019ll find a use for it later.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Patricia V.
