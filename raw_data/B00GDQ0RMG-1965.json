[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "All around great device!  Great being able to hide it behind the TV.  It even comes with an HDMI extender if you can't have it sticking straight out due to wall mounting.  WIFI range is outstanding and includes both 2.4 and 5 ghz.  App available that allows your phone to function as remote and works fantastic.  Amazon even has the stick setup to recognize your account straight out of the box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Public Reviewer # 1"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angie Hoffmann"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I absolutely love this device.
