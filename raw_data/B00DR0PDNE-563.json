[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received my Google Chromecast in the mail and it is fantastic! the versatility of how to plug it in along with extra extensions was very helpful as my TV is mounted on the wall with very little space to add cords. The setup of the Chromecast is very quick and easy with simple step by step instructions right on your screen.  Once set up, streaming has been flawless!
