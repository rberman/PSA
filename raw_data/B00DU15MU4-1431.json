Since it operates by connecting to our internet service via wifi, it has freed up our laptop that we had hooked up to our TV to watch shows on Hulu or Amazon. It is definitely easier to find Amazon Prime shows and movies on this device than it is on amazon.com.What would make it a 5 star product would be improved search methods of movies and shows on Amazon. I would like to be able to search for shows by rating (all PG rated movies, for example) and/or by genre like Hulu does and not have to scroll through every single movie to see what is available.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anita Craig"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I coul no believe how simple it was to set up..
