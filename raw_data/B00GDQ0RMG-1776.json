That being said I loved it when I tried it out and when we switch cable companies I will definitely purchase a new one. This turned my parents lower end HDTV into a Smart TV in a matter of minutes for just $40. The interface is fast (no lagging) and looks beautiful.. true HD and nothing flimsy about it. It was super easy to figure out and I could quickly teach my parents in their 50's how to work it. The Netflix app on here worked better than it did on my actual smart TV - rarely any buffering or errors. I'm genuinely upset I have to purchase a Roku instead just to use those apps!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ladysnakes"}]
