[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "An amazingly handy device. My tv isn't network-enabled in any fashion and my desktop is in a different room, so watching movies/shows from my PC was always difficult, either requiring to borrow a laptop or burn it onto a dvd. Enter the Chromecast, and now I can just open things up in a media center and stream it over. Also works great with various Android apps, allowing me to use them as a remote while watching shows/baseball, instead of having to get up and walk to another room to pause something.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jacob Smith"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "With this device, I can finally watch Netflix on the big screen TV. It was easly to install, and yes, you have to have wi-fi in the home for it to work. Out of the box, my tv input recognized it, and followed the prompts to connect to the wifi.  Once it configured, it works with everything that allows chromecast.  For the folks out there who are upset that you can't view your own videos on chromecast, I found that uploading your videos to utube solves that problem.  Its a great device and works like it should, and well worth the $35 it cost.

It seem that the reviews were mixed so I decided to try it out and see for myself.The setup was easy but there was a little glitch that caused some of the stations I tried to cast to show up red screen. After a complete reboot of my desktop computer (using the google chrome browser) I was able to cast from the networks as well as youtube and others that I had wanted to be able to use.The nicest thing about this device is I no longer have to have my laptop connected to the tv to watch my favorite shows.For the price it is a cool tool and I like it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Fourpoint"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We need to by two more of these so all our TV's have one.  We have been using the Wii box and an old blue ray player for net-flix and other services.  This is way easier and seems to do a better job of processing and the picture quality seems to be better.It's also great that we can wirelessly cast any web-page from the browser on the TV.  Fantastic and affordable.This is a huge step in the process of getting off the cable services.
