[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "The fire stick is ok. There are lots of movies and shows to choose from as well as different apps. My biggest complaint is the network connection. My fire stick is just above my wireless router and losses connection at least once a day. I have to unplug and plug back in and then it works fine again for a while. Also the fire stick needs to be plugged into a power source at all times to work, it would be nice if it just used a rechargeable battery. For the price it's a good device, but it still needs some improvements.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Just another Mom"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Worked first day.  Does nothing but drop connection now.  Wifi is strong as I can see the signal strength on my phone app.  Tried power cycling everything.  Doesn't help.  Read other posts and it appears that this is a very common problem.
