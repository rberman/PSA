We recently got rid of DirectTV and will not go back! The ability to choose programs that are commercial-free is priceless!The only cons are....... 1) tiny remote, easy to lose & 2) if the remote is accidentally touched, it will stop or change the show.The Fire Stick phone app is amazing! However,  For future upgrades, I would suggest a lanyard attachment for ease of storing or locating!!??", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is an excellent invention for those who don't use game boy consoles or buy a HDM cord to connect from laptop/internet to tv disabling your use of the laptop.
