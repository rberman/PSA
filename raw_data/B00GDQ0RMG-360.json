It'll start displaying the default screensaver while the sound is still playing. I had to hit any button on the remote to wake it up at least 5 times during one episode of The Wire. Can't find a solution to this problem in forums.Definitely will be returning this and going back to my Apple TV setup.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "V.N."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I purchased the Amazon Fire TV Stick mainly for streaming Netflix on our bedroom television. It was very easy to set-up, and I logged on to Netflix almost instantly. It is serving the exact purpose I purchased it for well. I don't care for the cluttered look of the home screen, and occasionally my streaming gets interrupted. I don't think this is a problem with the wiFi, as I have never had this problem with any other device. I also wasn't happy to see this go on sale for $19 on Prime Day, after I had purchased it for $34. Overall, it works well for our lesser used television.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This  definitely get my pick for product of the year.
