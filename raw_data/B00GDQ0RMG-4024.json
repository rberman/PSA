I had an Apple TV, but it wouldn't run Amazon Prime, whereas this unit runs Prime, Netflix and many other apps. With Apple TV I had to point the remote directly at the unit to make it work. Fire Stick works anywhere in the living room. I would say the picture quality is the same as Apple TV. I am hoping the software will improve for Netflix, as it is not as easy to navigate as it was with Apple, but overall I am very satisfies with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Westcoastgirl"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Fire TV Stick keeps on losing network connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dave"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is easy to install and use.  The user interface is clean and intuitive. The problem that I am having is with the ESPN streaming app. It continually stalls out and it gives you a dialogue box that claims there is a problem with the network connectivity. I tried deleting the ESPN app I had and downloading another but the same problem presented itself. I use the Netflix app on the Fire Stick and it works perfectly.

The remote app for the iphone is especially handy for voice searching.
