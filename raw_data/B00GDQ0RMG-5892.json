I received the stick two weeks ahead of schedule (I ordered on the day of release but was scheduled for 12/19/14 delivery). I didn't have to install a software update, as many reviewers referenced, so they must have taken care of it before hand. I connected to my wi-fi easily and have had no issues with the remote response times nor with buffering or dropped connections. I wish there was a TV power on/off and volume buttons on the remote to integrate the FireTV further into the viewing experience but am still happy with the product as is. Can't beat it for 20bucks and I like it more than the chromecast I've had for years.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Josh L"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This is not a bad product by any means, but you should know going in that it is 100% centered around being a Prime Member. The interface is built to give you access to Prime & other Amazon content above all else.My issues with it:I have the Roku stick that I've had for a few months prior to the Fire Stick being delivered. The Roku interface is far super in my opinion, it gives all of your 'channels' equal ground and lets you organize them however you want. With the Fire Stick it gives you your most recently viewed/used apps at the top of the screen, then 'featured apps' - this would be fine if I could some how choose what is displayed in the 'Featured apps' area but now it just seems like a random order. Thankfully it usually has Netflix up there consistently so there isn't any digging for that.There also doesn't seem to be an easy way to remove apps/channels (maybe I'm just missing it?). I see that I can remove them online in my account (similar to adding/removing Roku channels). But in the online interface it warns that deleting them there would cause them to not work on any devices they were installed on, which to me says that it will not remove it from the Firestick, it will just cause it to not function correctly any more.The good:While I do have some initial gripes about it, it is a good product. It's just not as well designed as the Roku. It does perform well. Surfing through menus and lists is quick and relatively easy.I would recommend this to anyone with a Prime Membership. Otherwise I'd say just get a Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Phillip-PDX"}]
