[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I own apple tv and chromecast as well. This one is great if you have amazon prime browsing is kind of a drag on the tv, so it's better to look it up on the computer before and search for it on the tv after. However the benefits are that it's a ton cheaper than apple tv and way more user friendly than chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tiffany April Adue"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the fire tv stick.
