[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "EXCELLENT! I would give this a full 5 stars if there weren't occasional buffering problems in Netflix. My wifi is plenty speedy enough - I think there might be something internal going on with the stick, since it feels like Amazon's own entertainment selections buffer without a hitch, but Netflix is the culprit for buffering hiccups. These are not very long, just a few seconds, but when it happens 4-5 times within a couple minutes, it can be annoying when it happens.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AndrewOrbit"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Did not perform well.  constantly lost wifi signal, apps would freeze. videos would always buffer and stutter.  Other devices on the network including a chromecast all play video better than the Fire TV.

We have a Roku3 on the primary TV, but this little thing is quite the competitor. The slide show feature turns our TV into a picture frame while not in use.Only drawback is that Amazon and Google don't play well together; no Google Play movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AmazonJoe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "have the chrome cast and I can asure you fire stick is much better...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "v bngmfnzxxhsgxyjxybnxgfncvgvjnxnxv kfmkdkgxhhn nchdhnvbxhgubuvbhhvhtbdgbvy hfgbmdjbmjfjbj"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick has us watching TV again.

They had tried to watch free streaming movies by plugging a laptop into the tv with an HDMI cord, and the buffering ruined all movies! Slowest loading ever, no matter how we changed the loading settings on the computer. The Fire stick totally solved this issue. The sound quality is a little different on the tv, but it is great to get through a movie without a 20 second pause every 5-10 minutes. This is the only feature I can speak to, but it is great and we know it's good quality because it's Amazon. Also, I ordered during the holiday backup, and it arrived a week or so early!One thing we didn't know is that the stick has to be plugged in to a wall outlet with an awkward cord. It makes the tv layout a little odd, but it works so we're happy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Reviewer 1"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Out of the box it was junk. trouble finding and keeping connected to router. I decided to order an HDMI extension and place it anywhere but behind the tv and it worked, no more streaming problems. What I ordered was \"Aurum Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Extension Cable Male - Female (6 feet) With Ethernet - Supports 3D and Audio Return Channel\". I removed the stick from the 4\" extension provided with the stick, connected the extension to that and the stick to the end of the extension. KAZAM!!!!!!!! Works like a champ.
