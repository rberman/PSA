Honestly, I wish I had known about it before I had gotten a Chrome Cast. I love the bluetooth remote and that you don't have to point directly at an IR sensor. I'm just really bummed that this doesn't have some sort of volume control. I have a big computer monitor that I have this plugged into an HDMI switcher, so I have no volume remote when watching TV. It's not a major deal, but the over-simple controls loses a star for me.Pros: Bluetooth remote, good apps for video/movies, clean UICons: Remote doesn't have volume control and is very minimal", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aaron Kelley"}]
