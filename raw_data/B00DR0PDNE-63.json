It is an easy way to stream media to a TV. Quality is 100 times good if the media has an app (such as netflix, hulu, youtube etc). Other media quality is o.k in my opinion.

We always used our ipad with a $10 USB cord to connect it to the TV.

We still need to use our ipad to operate the worthless Chromecast that won't even play Amazon Prime Videos. Don't buy it, use the $10 cord instead. Very disappointed, make sure to read the fine print before you purchase!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeana Lam-Pickett"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sunilkumar R Kheni"}]
