I am SO tired of proprietary ways of doing the same thing.  If it supported miracast then I could share from my blackberry 10, laptop, samsung or any other miracast enabled device.I have the same complaint about chromecast.The good is that they've put some serious horsepower in this thing.  If I had to replace my rokus I would probably go here but the only thing that would compel me to buy one right away would be miracast / WIDI support", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Dev Guy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is faster and works better, as far as I can tell, then streaming devices that cost $80 or so.Whether it has as many apps is a different question.Based on reviews I'd seen, I was afraid that HBO GO would not be there, but it was.

I've tried lots of tips/tricks to try to help it, with none having ay impact.  It's kind of a mood killer when you're trying to watch a show, only to have it suddenly stop, buffer forever, then say that it can't play back at this time and you have to physically reboot the Stick to get it to start again.  Some days I never have to do this, other days it's every 15 minutes, and some days programs won't load at all.This might be a device-by-device hardware flaw, sine a lot of people seem to be able to use their Stick without any issues.  All I know is the one I have is pretty much unusable and I'm not the only one who has these issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Craig Jacobson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great.
