[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "We are very pleased with Firestick. Previously, we had used our Samsung blue ray DVD player to stream Netflix through and were not able to get closed caption or Amazon Prime movies. With the Firestick we are able to stream movies from Netflix, Prime, and numerous others. The best thing of all, is that they all have closed caption now. Being hearing impaired,  this is a huge plus for me!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Edyouk8or"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install and use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patricia L.
