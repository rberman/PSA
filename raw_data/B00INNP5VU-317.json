I like the Roku brand, and have had a number of them. The UI is really good, and it works as advertised. The only thing I don't like is that when the sleep timer turns the TV off, the device keeps running. So shows in a series will continue to play, even though I cannot see them. Then I need to go figure out what episode I really watched each night. Maybe this is a Roku thing on all devices? I never noticed before. Otherwise this is a great little device, especially for the price. It beats the heck out of the useless applications that come with Vizio TV's.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sean P. Moran \"spmoran\""}]
