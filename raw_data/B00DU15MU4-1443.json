I thought this would simplify the task for my wife, but it just turned into a headache as the unit wouldn't turn on, I would replace the batteries in the remote, it would work for two days, then not turn on the next time. Frustrating. I'll return this and we will go back to using the Wii which is always reliable if not easy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Craig A DeLoughery"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I LOVE the Amazon Fire TV.

We're not techie at all. It just doesn't matter with the Amazon Fire TV.  Instructions are clear; we luckily already had the required cable; set-up was easy; we're enjoying our free month of Netflix.  The only problem we have had is not telling our son we have the Fire TV before Christmas--he gave us another brand (Roku).For folks who are used to streaming to any type of device, the ease of the Fire TV may not be a big deal; but aging Baby Boomers should love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cindi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to setup and use.
