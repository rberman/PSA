[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I purchased this on sale for Prime members when first released.  I also own two Roku 3 players and two AppleTV players.  I cut the cord on cable, so anything I watch on TV is either DVD/Blu-ray or a streaming service (iTunes, Amazon Prime, Hulu+, Netflix, HBO Now, etc.).  This is a decent streaming stick, and is very much like and AppleTV.  If you're an Amazon Prime member, Prime video and music seem to stream faster than on the Roku 3.  Amazon Cloud Photos load fast as well.  You can access your Netflix accounts and Hulu+ on this, but like Apple, Amazon's FireStick is a semi-closed ecosystem.  You won't be able to access your iTunes library on this much like you wouldn't access your Amazon library on an AppleTV.  It's still a great product, I love that it comes with a remote or you can use an app on your phone to control it.  You can optionally purchase a voice-controlled remote from Amazon, which I haven't tried, but seems pretty cool.The FireStick has two problems with it that prevent me from using it more than maybe once a month: the interface and lack of UltraViolet support.  The interface is just a bit messy to me.  I'd take boring and streamlined compared to its current look.  The lack of support for UV (UltraViolet digital copies that often come with the purchase of a DVD or Blu-ray).  This is where services like Vudu, Flixster, CinemaNow, and M-Go excell; they let you access and purchase digital copies that can be used across devices.  The FireStick has no support for any of these services, so if you have a digital library outside of Amazon's, you have to switch streaming devices.  The Roku devices end up being clear winners when it comes to streaming devices (they support UltraViolet libraries, Amazon's prime libraries, and many more channels).  The benefit of Amazon's streaming service is that they have a lot of movie rentals not available anywhere else, however, you can access them with a Roku.  As a stand-alone device, it pretty good and super-fast.  But it's lack of features and support for other technologies prevent it from being a great device or even In the competition.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Morgan Newton \"Super-Dad\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product, only be fore-warned, if your WiFi is not a reliable wonderful connection, don't bother.

I have an Apple TV and purchased through the Sling promotion (which is in itself disappointing) to get further to reaching my \"unplugged\" goals.  The set up was ridiculously complicated, i.e., the USB line to the Stick to the plug to the + HDMI cord to the Stick to the TV.  Are you serious?  I thought it was just a plug and play.  Not that impressed with the actually functionality, it is not smooth and the interface feels complicated.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ABC"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use.

We cut out the expensive cable pig a while ago but missed having movies or shows to watch other than on our phones or tablet.  Simply plug it in to TV follow the prompts and use your existing Prime membership to watch about any movie or show you want.  Of course some are only on Netflix or HBO but so what.  Very inexpensive way to enjoy TV and movies old and new.  Thousands of free ones included in Prime but you can also buy or rent new and old movies or shows whenever you want.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jason"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "natalie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "With the recent upgrade, it now works in hotels with a \"login screen\" on their network.  Since I've gotten the upgrade, I've only tried it at a Hyatt House and a Hyatt Place, but both used a \"login screen\" and it worked fine. Video quality was very good and it was a pleasure to be able to watch Netflix, Hulu and Prime in the hotel room.  I'll probably try to determine a better packing method, but I just put the stick, the remote and the wires into a zip lock bag to keep everything together.I wasn't able to get the remote app on my Android phone to connect, but I suspect that may have been due to the hotel network.  I'll try to get it to connect at home where I have control over the network and then see if it works in hotels.  If so, I can leave the remote at home when traveling.At home I use a Roku.  I did try the Amazon Fire TV, but returned it for the simple reason that I didn't value the additional features, etc. (like voice search) enough for me to toss the Roku.  However, for traveling (which I do frequently), the Stick is terrific.  Very easy and quick to setup and connect in a hotel, then you have access to what whatever you want to watch - better than a Chromecast (I have one of those too).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
