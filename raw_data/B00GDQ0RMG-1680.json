[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Missed the part where it has to have a separate power supply. Not sure I would have got it instead of the actual Amazon TV box. Otherwise it works great, however don't use a phone charger for the power supply, it was making my Fire Stick overheat and it kept resetting. Otherwise, it's just like any other thing that makes internet go on your TV.4 stars is enough.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gregory Fairbanks Jr."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was everything I expected and more.
