Its use is pretty limited unless all you want to do is stream YouTube videos to the TV. The biggest problem is that you can't cast from the Chrome browser on Android or iPad. Video quality was mediocre compared to HDMI cable from a laptop on the same wireless connection.  Control over the stream could be better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeff"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We love our Google Chromecast.  I really like the fact that I can use my iPhone to control it.  I have it plugged into our tv downstairs and use it while on the treadmill to watch Netflix.  We even stopped paying for our satellite box in the basement because I spent my time watching Netflix on this the whole time anyway.  It's also nice because it is compact and can easily pack in luggage to take on trips to plug into the tv in the hotel / resort.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
