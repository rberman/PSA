The first months it worked great, I could play several YouTube videos without any issue; then it started pausing and resuming every second (yeah every single second) so it made it useless.I tried by resetting it to default and it did not work. I decided to try it with another TV and another wireless network, and got the same result. The annoying thing is the fact that I cannot pause the video once it gets in that Pause/Resume cycle and it starts at the very beginning of the YouTube video, the only thing I can do is to play another video and maybe I will be able to pause it at start so it can be buffered. Once I pause the video and wait for a while, if I play again the video may play normally. The problem is I cannot pause the video sometimes and it should not work like that.Hope google finds the issue and solve it one day. Should be an easy task. It is not a network problem, it is a Chromecast / YouTube issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "62/77", "author": "FROILAN MORALES"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good just plug and view on your TV.

I'm officially dumping my cable bill and this bad boy is helping out.  We've had our first one for quite a while and kept moving it between rooms.  My laziness has forced me to purchase a second.
