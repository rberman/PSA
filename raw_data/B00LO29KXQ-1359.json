[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am so glad I got this. I was reading and trying to deciede between this and the Roku or Google chromecast...I am glad I choose the Amazon fire stick for many reasons. Much free content in all categories. Easy to use format and uncomplicated remote. I cant say enough about it, Worth every penny. I saved money because I downsized my satellite programming because of the fire stick, as I no longer need all those channels since many are on the fire stick for free!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "char307 \"charky307\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The remote control lacks functional quality.

Or It rarely works. It worked when we first got it, but frankly the performance of even streaming netfilx was so shoddy, that I was better off using the netflix app built into the TV than using this device. Meanwhile the apple running on the same wireless network, 3 feet away, runs just fine.

Three different phone calls for help and no one could help me get past the request for a password (not their fault. All tried their best) This was supposed to be an easy to install item. No instruction booklet, so if you're having problems, you're out of luck. Have high blood pressure, and had heart surgery this spring. Didn't need the aggravation. I'd return the item if I didn't  have to re box it and drive somewhere to mail it. Instead it's in the garbage where it belongs. Oh well, caveat emptor. While I'm at it, why is it so hard to leave a complaint about an order. I've wasted three or four hours on this issue. Cmon Amazon , you can do better. I'm a loooong time prime customer and hate to complain, but there it is. Easy to install? Not even close. Call me disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Donald L.
