I could not get through the apps store on my HTC Incredible. When I used my laptop to download the setup app, I received an obtuse wireless connection error message with no explanation of what was wrong or how to fix it. The Google Chromecast may be a wonderful product but the installation process is not ready for prime time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/5", "author": "Bob Poirier"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I like the product for watching Netflix and Youtube content. My main reason I purchased was to beam out of market NHL games onto my TV with the cast tab feature. Although it works, the picture quality is awful and the lag is horrific. I hardwired my laptop to our router to get a better picture quality. Other than that, I'm excited for future updates and newer applications. I love not having to run my PS3 just to watch Netflix on my TV now though .", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "interjector"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing product :) and is also cheap, easy to setup, my friends love it !!!Response times are faster than other similar prods (apple tv) oh ! and it's 1080 !! :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ed"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "great way to stream netflix and a couple other apps to HDMI tv.  big miss at this point is that I cannot stream everything from my IOS device to it.  no picture or browsers...all in all excellent device for netflix and pandora", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "McCloughan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works exactly as advertised and for an unbelievably low price.

I'm a techie and it's one of the better items I have purchased.  Buy it now before Google realizes it could sell it for 3 times as much.  The best part is that it's not a \"mirroring\" tool.  It actually casts the video so you are free to use your phone/tablet for other things.  You can even turn your device off!  Great for battery saving too.  USB cord can hook into your TV for constant power.  Only a few apps (Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and HBO Go), but you can be sure many more will be coming in the near future.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Tony T"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this specifically to use with Netflix, so I knew going in that the content that was compatible was limited, but that was fine with me. For thirty-five bucks, you CAN NOT GO WRONG. It's so easy to set up; took me all of five minutes before I was watching YouTube and Netflix.
