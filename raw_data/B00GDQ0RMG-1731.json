[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "Was so excited to finally order and get my Amazon fire stick in so I could use it in my room. I have been nothing but disatisfied with this product. I followed all the steps set it up and since day one has not worked correctly. Says it is connected to my internet with very good strength yet cannot play anything and when it finally does load it loads to 25% plays for less than a minute and loads again. I have good internet everything else in the house works yet this doesn't. I wish I wouldn't have spent my money on this and I wouldn't have had I know it would be more of a hassle than a blessing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.R. \"C.R.\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Great when it works.

The reason I am giving it 1 star is because it completely stopped working after that first week. I have tried a different Amazon power source and it still will not work. It is completely shot. I really love Amazon and have a Fire phone myself, but this is the first Amazon product I have been unhappy with.

It doesn't seem powerful enough to load a TV episode reliably.  Says \"not available\" a lot and I have to just keep trying.  Also isn't able to do captions, which I use regularly.  I bought it because I thought it would be faster than the old first generation ROKU that I was using on that TV.  By the numbers it should be.  The resolution is a bit better when it works, which isn't often.  Otherwise, going back to the 5 year old Roku.
