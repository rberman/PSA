It took awhile to set up because one of my hdmi ports didn't work. Once I figured that out it set right up. I don't like having to pay for movies if they aren't on prime. I wanted to watch Indiana Jones, but it was 3.99. I thought that was ridiculous for such an old movie. Amazon needs to address that issue and fix that.  It is way easier than my dvd to use. I can pause and forward without any problem. I still have lots of movies to watch, but would like to be able to watch ones not on prime. If there are 40,000 movies to watch on prime, where are they  located???", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "debbie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "All I can say is -amazing.
