Performance is also good. I'm ranking the Fire TV Stick only two stars because it constantly forgets/looses the Netflix and Hulu Plus password. At first I thought this might be due to software upgrades, but it happens constantly. The Fire TV stick does remember my Amazon Prime credentials just fine. Having to resign in to services such as Netflix and Hulu Plus constantly is unacceptable. Most reviewers here seem to ignore this issue but it is a serious time waster and although Amazon is not responsible for maintaining the Netflix and Hulu apps for their device, ultimately these apps are going to be very important to many buyers. I also have a FireTV (box) and it does not have this problem. I would avoid the Fire TV stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Janice"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "is better than the standard apps on my smart tv ....love it!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "edward"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent features at a reasonable price point.
