I received my Chromecast today at about 3:15 pm and was casting from Netflix, Youtube and from tabs in Chrome within 15 minutes.  If ease of use is important to you, then this is your device.Casting is done from the different apps that are found in the Chromecast universe, and not from a Chromecast app (the Chromecast app aids in set-up and adding new devices should you have more than one).  For instance, you open Youtube, pick a video, then tap the \"cast\" button which is easily seen at the top of each app.  Voila, your video appears on the screen!My only complaint is that Amazon prime is not a part of the Chromecast universe yet.  But, at a cost nearly 1/3 of all the other streaming devices, Chromecast is a welcome addition to my home.Performance will depend on the speed of your wifi network.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Be aware that you will need to have a smartphone or tablet to use first and act as a remote. The Chromecast itself is incredibly easy to use and set up, but it does not act as a receptor for your WiFi or as a console in and of itself. Rather, it will accept relayed content from your smart device and display it on the television or HDMI receiver.If you are looking for an all-in-one box that will browse Netflix, Hulu, etc., this is not the item for you.

Unfortunately the first one I ordered never came (said it was delivered but it never was) but Amazon was AMAZING and replaced it for me right away.
