[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought 2 of these - one for the kitchen TV, and one for a guest bedroom TV that doesn't have a satellite connection. They are easy to set up and connect to WiFi.

You are not able to play downloads movies but can stream thru netflix. I also can not view my home movies or pictures directly from my phone but can thru google+. I also have to broadcast my SSID, this will not work if you don't. I even got it set up and working then stopped broadcasting like others mentioned in comments but it will stop working. I can use my laptop with the chromecast plug in installed in Chrome and view web pages but not able to do that from my phone, at least i haven't figure out how yet. Youtube is supported and can easily view from laptop or phone. Since i don't have a netflix subscription i only use this when viewing pictures or i want to look at websites on a bigger screen. Would be nice if the software would be updated so i can stop broadcasting my SSID.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Orlando Cole"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It didn't do what I expected it to do.I sold it on ebay", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Smooth"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This makes your TV a Internet TV at a fraction of the cost of buying one with this option.
