I find it slightly easier to use than Google Chromecast because it has a remote control that you use to select the apps/shows right on the TV. I also really like that it is compatible with Amazon Prime videos (of course) and Showtime's on demand app. However, a HUGE deficiency is that it does not support HBO Go. I did not realize this when I purchased it and had I known that, I may have bought the Chromecast again (even though it broke several months into use). Granted, Amazon does offer HBO shows, but not anywhere close to the extent of what you can view on HBO Go. Amazon has a limited number of seasons and does not have the new releases, so unless you want to catch up on old HBO content it's pretty much useless in that regard. Hopefully it lasts longer than the Chromecast....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tori"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to set up and use....and cheap!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chris Chavez"}]
