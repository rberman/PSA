It is so nice to be able to watch different shows on my television now instead of watching on my computer via Internet. The price for this is really reasonable and I want to get myself another one. The fire stick can be good to give a way as a gift to someone. This is also good for people like myself who may not have a smart tv and it's so easy to get it hooked up to your TV and then your good to go. This is also good for people who may not have cable TV as well. I can't believe this little small device can really enrich your TV experience and I can listen to the radio through the TV via iHeart radio or Pandora. I just got this Fire Tv stick yesterday so I'm pretty excited right now...lol. Kudos to you Amazon for making this!...You have just outdone yourself this time. :-)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "HiddenandundiscoveredonAmazon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Better than chromecast", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Claire  pryce"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you have Prime... you need this!

After connecting it and using it for a bit I noticed the control would register more clicks than I had pushed at times. Like when trying to type something with the keyboard when i click right to choose a letter it would Like register 10 clicks at times. Happened randomly and not all the time but enough to be really annoying since when searching for something it would skip a lot. Got a remote replacement from amazon and nope same problem so I didn't have a faulty control its just sucks. A workaround is using the smartphone app client but if I wanted to use my phone as a control I'd use my Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ricardo"}]
