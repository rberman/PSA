[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Honestly, I love the Fire TV stick when it works.But therein lies the problem. This stick has HORRIBLE WiFi reception. You will not get good use out of this stick unless you have it in the same room as your router.

I own a Chromecast, Roku LT, and soon to get an AppleTV, and because of my kids attention span and my busy schedule, we stream across all devices often splitting movies and TV into 2-3 viewing sessions.  Besides the media streamers, we watch through gaming consoles, PC's, Mac's, Apple phones and tablets, and our most used services are HBO-GO, Netflix, Watch ABC, FOX Now, and our DVDs via Plex.  Unfortunately, the Fire TV Stick is not quite ready for primetime.  On a positive note the device has a nice user interface, and the voice search, when it works, is convenient.  However, for one, after trying several times, can't get YouTube to pair efficiently with my iPhone 6+.  It seems to connect, but then won't search through phone, and won't cast.  Secondly, Amazon's HBO-GO app does not have my cable company as one of my providers (which is probably the cable company's fault), but it's now the only device that won't authenticate my HBO access.  Sometimes Netflix won't play videos, so although the hardware is strong, the firmware still has bugs for me.  Perhaps I will repurchase at a later date.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul S. Rojo"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Not loving it. We have a high grade router and wifi set up and my smart tv in the bedroom does fine. Using this on the non-smart tv in the living room and it takes 10 min to start up properly and then buffers constantly. Add to that, I finally figured out that this thing is what has been making my entire system slow down to a crawl. Unplugged it and my pc acted like new again. Going in the trash. Don't have the patience for it. Will go back to Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Grace"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Worked great for a few months then went blank.
