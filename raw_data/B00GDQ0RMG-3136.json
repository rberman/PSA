However, the prices to rent a movie are extremly high, because its a rental the rates should be like $2.50 for a 5 day span and then removed so the renter can no longer have viewing capabilities.  No one wants to pay $6.00 to rent a movie when you can purchase the movie for a few more dollars at walmart and have it to watch over and over again.  My only other concern was that if you do not become a prime member you are limited to what you can view and by offering the 30 day trail new members see how vital to your service prime is and has no choice but to purchase it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "raquel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great gadet", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mitchell J.

I guess I'm disappointed in Amazon TV's offerings. My cable provider offers more programming On Demand and more titles are free to me via my cable provider than via Amazon TV.
