With that said I decided to try the Fire Stick and while I wasn't disappointed in the hardware or performance I am not a fan of Amazon's interface (also not a fan of Kindle Fire interface). That's a personal preference though, there's not necessarily anything wrong with the interface, it's just overly busy for my taste. Everything seems perform snappy after the initial setup which was quite laggy for several minute or more while apps and preferences were synced and downloaded.

We have an Apple TV in our family room but I wanted something to watch in my bedroom while my hubby is away.

I have Amazon prime and, in my opinion this unit would be worthless without it. The unit is seemingly designed to flow perfectly with the Kindle fire HD and a prime membership.With prime I am able to watch full seasons, or even full runs of my all-time favorite TV shows, and I have watched multiple movies that I never had the opportunity watch before. The only reason I would give this unit four stars, is that occasionally the unit will indicate that there is no network connection. This would not be a problem, and I may assume that there actually was a network issue, if I did not have six other wireless devices telling me that the connection was stable. Apparently this is a known problem and the solution (given somewhere in a chat forum) was to simply unplug the unit and plug it back in. I have done that twice when it has locked up, and it is come back within moments each time. That said, this is a rarity, and given the quality of the TV and movie experience, the ease-of-use, and all of the features, I can handle an occasional restart. Between this unit and my Kindle fire HD, I am considering dropping my cable service. It's amazing how far technology has come!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "GreyNC"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "wish there were more free movies", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "T.
