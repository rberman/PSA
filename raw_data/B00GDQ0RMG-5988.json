[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "A very straight forward device. Very easy and quick to set up. We have already watched movies and tv series. Also, the Amazon PC web site for the Fire Stick makes for a powerful and easy access option for reviewing and adding items to the watch list.All in all, a great product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "MaryAnn Werner and Edward Werner"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "it is very easy to hook up and it works great .

Greenwood Jr."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Whoever designed the remote should be shot.Simplicity in design is one thing and is a virtue that all industrial design should try to achieve.However, not including ANY grip features on an all-smooth plastic back or DIRECTION ARROWS on WHICH PIECE should be sliding is MORONIC. Remote design fail.I'll update this review once I figure out how to PUT THE BATTERIES IN!!!Update...30 minutes later....Okay, managed to pry off the battery lid and installed the batteries. Sheesh, talk about dumb design. ARGH! Enough ranting...CONNECTION of the Firestick was surprisingly straightforward and idiot-proof. Connected it to back of my Samsung flatscreen was not too difficult, albeit I had to use the enclosed HDMI extender because of the tight dimensions. A PLUS! Thanks Amazon for including the hdmi extender dongle!WIFI connection was straight forward until it wouldn't connect because my wireless router has MAC filtering on. Had to turn mac filtering off for it to connect. Still haven't figured out where the MAC address of the Firestick is printed or encoded. Will re-enable mac filtering once I find it's mac address.SOFTWARE and USER INTERFACE was surprisingly very well laid out. KUDOS to the user interface team! (I still have a bone to pick with whomever designed the remote control.) All pertinent controls are well placed, Since this is an Amazon product, the Prime Video and related links take center stage. There are links for Movies, TV, Watchlist, Video Library (instant-video movies and tv shows you bought ) Games, Apps, Music, Photos, Settings.I was happily surprised all my Prime iCloud photos showed up and I was able to run a slideshow on my big screen tv!SOFTWARE APPS CHOICE was a bit limited. I'll chuck this up to early adoption syndrome. Hopefully as the product matures, more apps will be available. I was disappointed that VUDU app was not available. While the FLIXSTER app was, VUDU is the other half of the inane marriage that is called the ULTRAVIOLET ecosystem. Some movies only stream via FLIXSTER, some only stream via VUDU, WE NEED BOTH.VIDEO QUALITY streamed from Prime HD sources were surprisingly good. KUDOS Amazon! I cannot say the same about FLIXSTER stream quality. Quite dissapointed with Flixster stream quality. Much compression and artifacts. Boohoo!Video quality from NETFLIX is comparable to Prime HD, pretty good. Yay NETFLIX !OVERALL IMPRESSION is a good buy! For the money spent $19 (two day launch special) even $39 price is a good deal; I find this a very good value! Small inconspicuous, inexpensive device that can add new life to HDMI capable tvs.HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Brooklyn Bumpkin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am really shocked.This little thing is amazing!!!I paid $19 on the 2 day promotion.I am so glad i did.Its super fast,  loads netflix and Amazon Prime Movies with hardly any delay at all.Faster than any of my other devices.And i have ROKU 3 Apple Tv  PS3 xbox 360  Blu Ray players WDTV Live, all of which can stream  and none of them apart from ROKU 3, come close to this Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stuart Scott-davis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very satisfied with the Fire TV Stick.  It operates smoothly and quickly.  I have two ROKU 3's in my home, and the Fire Stick is just as fast if not faster when navigating.The remote is small and attractive and easy to operate by feel.  This is being used on a bedroom TV.  The included HDMI extension was needed because of the limited clearance to the wall at the HDMI connector, a nice touch by Amazon to include that accessory.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anthony2102"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love.

WiFi drops all the time. Every second time I try it it says lost connection. Netflix can't connect 3 out of 4 times I try. Constantly tries to load and fails. I installed Plex, very slow, disconnects etc...I thought problem with the router(I have attached modem with WiFi) I replaced it with netgear 3500  same problems. So I tend to believe its a stick itself. I'll ask for a replacement or refund.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Alided"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Used it only once so far and it worked perfectly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S. SILVERMAN \"Steve\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I had no problem installing this product, and all features work well.The only issue I have with this product is the placement of the Home Button on the remote.  For some reason whenever I pause a movie, I somehow hit the Home Button instead of the Pause/Play Button, which brings the display back to the Home screenThis requires me to go back into the  app (Netflix) I was in.The Home button should be positioned in a different place on the remote. I highly recommend this product to others.
