Honestly there is not much but a few things you should think about before buying one.If you are just wanting Netflix and could care less about viewing photos, mirroring displays, renting or buying movies and TV shows or playing music then Chromecast might be a better option for you. It's also less then half the price of an Apple TV.There are other options out there such as Roku. Roku is more open and has access to a bit more content, but that content is more obscure for most people and Apple TV has all the big players on board.  Where Apple TV is better then a Roku IMHO is interface and usability.  Roku is great but the interface can at times be slow and annoying. Apple TV has it's issues here and there as well, but using both for the last few years I get far fewer issues with my Apple TV, and Roku is very slow to update when issues arise.  So if you are the kind of person that has to have every single content provider under the sun a Roku is a damn fine device. If you are looking for all the best mainstream content with a lot of extras and a smooth interface then Apple TV may suit you better.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "R. Windsor"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I tried this and the Roku. I found that the the Roku had WAY more channels (apps), but in the end, I opted for the Apple TV since I probably wouldn't even watch 1/16 of the media available on the Roku. The AirPlay functionality really sold me, as I am able to stream my Xfinity online media to my TV, as well as all the media that is not on the Apple TV yet. So who cares if I don't get the Korean News channel or the vintage horror movie channel...Between Hulu, Netflix, HBO, PBS, ABC, and the AirPlay option, I'm all set.The device itself is true Apple...High quality, great UI (Way better than Roku), easy to  use, and the remote is small, functional and works well from a distance. If you own a Mac, the remote also doubles as a remote for the computer as well.Great functionality with iTunes and Home sharing, as well. I am able to play my entire iTunes library through the Apple TV, which then goes through my sound bar.I love it!
