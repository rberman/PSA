I wish there were more games. I wish I could find something to use my 2nd controller for - as I got suckered into thinking  I could use two.  There is no customer support or forums for this thing, unless you're a programmer.  All in all i really like the system but there isn't too much out there for movies or television unless you pay for it.  And yes, I'm a Prime Member.  Netflix is a better option for movies and tv shows but Fire Tv excels at games but there aren't many out there and forget about playing against someone at home unless you have a Fire Tablet of Pad (not sure what they call it).  I am hoping things get better, I'll wait another few months before putting mine up for sale.  This will have a big influence on if I decided to renew my Prime Membership. I like it but think it could be better. There really should be better support for this thing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "Joseph W Burr"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Seriously, I give this a 4 star rating due to it not being really any better than my old school roku for about a 1/3 more money. I do enjoy my roku but other than the voice feature the Amazon fire TV did not do any better job than it.

I own an Apple TV which is fabulous.  I decided to get this for my mother because of voice activation.  Well it only works with Amazon programs.  Then it would say it couldn't understand her.  She has excellent diction.  She was never able to get it to work correctly.  It would slip in and out of Netfix.  We had numerous techs try to help.  I bought this in June.  After 5 months I figured it was a $100 down the drain.  She now has an Apple TV which is light years ahead of this product.  It works perfectly for her every time!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/12", "author": "Kathleen B."}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It wasn't made clear to me that the streaming video was NOT included with the free six month prime trial for students.
