[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've had my Fire Stick (2 of them, actually) for more than 2 weeks now. I'm totally please by this device. It functions so quickly. The remote is small and simple to use. Many Apps are available for both common streaming services as well as unexpected ones. I especially enjoy the PBS app. And Amazon Prime Music is awesome via the Fire Stick. If you have wondered if this is worth its small cost, wonder no more. It's absolutely worth it. Try it!  I've had a Chromecast for nearly a year, but the Fire Stick blows it away.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "2 Alarm Guy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it...and so do the kids.

I have owned the Chromecast since it first came out and it does great even on a slow internet connection. So since I'm a prime member I would get the stick and it would be twice what I can do with the Chromecast. But on,The Fire stick is choppy and there is no way to adjust the settings so you can use it on slow internet connections . It's a shame, they say they have so much more Technology than chrome on the side by side comparison but when it comes down to frustration free entertainment they are losing the battle. I travel for a living and I like watching what I want when I get to my destination. I really wanted to like the Fire Stick and does great at very high speed connections . Unfortunately not every place has that option. I have only ran into a few spot the Chromecast failed but the Fire stick fails 3 times as much. If your going to use the Fire Stick and you have a good internet speed your going to love it. But if you have slower internet connection it will only frustrate you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "J.
