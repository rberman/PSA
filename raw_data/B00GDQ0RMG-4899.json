No more waiting for my iPhone to reconnect to the Chromecast so that I can pause or rewind my movie! I'm keeping my Chromecast for the various apps I have that connect well to it, including the one that lets me cast from my browser, but I will be using the Fire most of the time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott Eldridge"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "nice", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Vitaly Klyarfeld"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy install and works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Russell Esau"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great! - Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Dempsey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love love love it!! Super easy to set up upon purchase; does have to be updated upon first use so it took a little but longer than I would like. We watch prime videos and Netflix, primarily. I find it very easy to navigate to what I want (we do not have the voice upgrade.) My children are able to use it no problem, (ages 10, 8, 4) and it has parent guard so they cannot purchase anything. We have used it for about six weeks now. Streaming is fast unless watching during prime streaming hours (when it will be slow on any device so it is not fire stick related.) I only experienced one technical issue and I was able to resolve it by unplugging and trying again.  Love it and recommend to anyone who heavily streams from Netflix like our family does!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I loved the Fire TV Stick because its the exact same thing as the Fire TV but smaller ,but a tiny problem at first was the wiring but it got easier.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ginny Orzell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic device, so much faster and more stable than our Roku2 was, apps are nicer too, more responsive and feature filled.
