[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is great in terms of value as I only got it for 19.99 during the 3 day sale. But if I were to pay for it at 39.99, I would think it is a little pricey, as it still has a lot of bugs and crashes often. I'd probably pay more to get the Fire TV instead for a better build quality.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SK2O"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "At first I loved the fire stick.  It was easy to set up and connect.  But then came the problems.  It has trouble playing anything other than Amazon Prime videos.  When I try to use Netflix it is laggy and rarely loads, same thing with Showtime Anytime.  I know it isn't my internet connection because when I use my computer or other device it works just fine.  Even episodes on prime instant video are starting to get buggy and slow down now as well.  I hope this gets fixed soon or it is going to be thrown in the trash.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Steve"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy to install and use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jim"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Not what I expected , you have to pay for everything not satisfied at all !!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mitch Soto JR"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "What an excellent gadget.

Until this supports Google or Google supports Amazon (or I want to bother with a Roku), I have to have two devices.My real issue is just how the interface is designed for AMAZON so heavily.  It feels like you have to go out of your way to do anything unless you focus on Amazon services.
