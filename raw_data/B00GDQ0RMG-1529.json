I didn't want to spring to run satellite to my basement, so bought the Fire Stick as an alternative.  The reviews were so glowing I thought it would be fantastic.  Once I had it plugged in, however, most content has to be purchased.  If you are not an Amazon Prime member (which I now am), you really have very little access to a decent catalog of things to watch.  Yes, you can watch YouTube and a couple shows on apps like the History Channel, but by and large, I was far better served to purchase a cord to run from my Kindle to my TV and watch everything on that.  Disappointing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Laura \"Laura M\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "After comparison shopping Apple TV and Fire TV Stick, I chose the latter both for its cost and the services offered. I hold memberships with both Netflix and Amazon Prime, and I'm happily streaming away. The Fire TV Stick saves me from adding another cable box for the ceramics studio in my detached garage.
