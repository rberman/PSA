[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my fire stick so much I purchased a second one for another TV.  A week before purchasing the first fire stick I bought a google chromecast and it was very difficult to set-up and had to use my computer to control what was being streamed, now it is in a box in the gadget drawer.  The fire stick was awesome, just plug it in, enter passwords and a little cartoon guy pops up and explains everything.
