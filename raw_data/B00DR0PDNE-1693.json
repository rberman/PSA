Then it would connect. Back and forth. No changes in my set-up. It was just fickle. I think I watched maybe about twenty hours or so of content. Now it doesn't work at all and I can't return it.

I'm sending it back.  It doesn't work with Google's own products.  Yes, it and stream Netflix and YouTube, but that's about it.  I have it on my laptop and on my ipad.  First, it doesn't work well (or at all) with Google Hangouts.  If you are Chromecasting and someone calls you on a Hangout, that opens in a new window which doesn't have the Chromecast extension button on it.  I found a post online that said you could set up (from the Hangouts page -- NOT from the Hangout icon), then, once you've set that up, you copy that url into a tab on your chrome browser then make the Hangout call.  That's a lot of extra work to go through just to do a Google Hangout.  When I did this, the sound from the party I was calling didn't work (even though it did work when I called them through a regular Google Hangout window).On the iPad, it's worse.  I downloaded Chrome for the iPad, but the Google extension doesn't go to the Chrome Browser on the iPad.  The only thing I can get it to work with on the iPad is YouTube.  Google Hangouts on the iPad don't work with it either.Why would Google make a product that doesn't work with its own products and app?  I don't see what everyone is so excited about.  It is hugely disappointing and limited.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "S Patterson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The best web for TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jos\u00e9 Diniz Gon\u00e7alves"}]
