I was a little disappointed with how many things you have to pay for with the Fire Stick. I planned on cancelling my pay channels with DirecTV and using the Fire Stick for movies, but after using it for a week I think I may keep my movie channels and use this occasionally when new movies come out. All in all I like the product but was hoping for more movies and shows to be included with my Prime membership.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jason"}]
