We also use it to stream movies from our Android phones to the TV.  Down side for us is we have to use the TV remote to switch from one HDMI input to the other.  Good news is the unit only turns on when you switch to it's HDMI input.The NFL rewind stream is not great.  It'll chop and blurr from time to time.  I probably need a computer with a better processor.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Fish Hunter \"Eddie\""}]
