For $39 getting it was a no brainer.  I got my Fire TV stick on December 24 and installed it within minutes on my HD TV. The remote works like magic.  The stick is all it was claimed to be. As an Amazon Prime member I can watch quite a few free movies and rent others as well at competitive rates.  I am very happy with the Stick so far and plan to watch of a bunch old episodes of HBO programs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chakrakodi R.

It's a pretty simple setup (though I wish you could skip the intro video). Most of the apps run pretty fast and work well. Some apps do cause the entire device to restart on occasion; Plex has been the biggest cause so far. It's hard to place blame on the FireTV Stick, because I think a lot of this is the app's fault.One thing that the device is not very good (which is unfortunate, because it's your only option on the Stick) is the wifi. Granted this will vary heavily based on router type / setup, but in one particular instance where I've had my FireTV Stick installed, the wifi performance was horrible. I will place some blame on the FireTV Stick itself, as a cell phone on wifi in the same area performs just fine. The FireTV Stick will often disconnect from the wifi when behind the TV in this scenario. I found that using the HDMI extension cable and trying to hang it to the side of the TV helps a little bit.Something that works extremely well, that I think a lot of people will be happy about, is Kodi Media Center (XBMC). You have to enable dev mode and side-load the APK; but that process is pretty easy (for a techy person). The other pain is that you need to go into settings and manage apps to get to side loaded apps. Other than that, Kodi itself runs very fast and well. 1080p / 720p HD videos stream from a NAS with no lag or issues. Way, way, way faster, in fact, than Plex on the same FireTV. If you're looking for an inexpensive way to get Kodi on your TV, look no further than the FireTV Stick.On another note, I like that you can search for media and it offers alternative sources to play the media from (such as Hulu Plus). Though I don't recommend bothering with Hulu Plus. I setup a trial as a result of it being shown as an alternative source to play a TV show I searched for, but just as soon as my episode finished, I cancelled the trial subscription. Hulu has good content and streams high quality, but the ads just ruin it; and with no plan available to disable ads for a higher price... Anyhow, that's a rant for another place/time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S. Clyde"}]
