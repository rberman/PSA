[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Fire Stick does a great job how I expected it to perform for Plex, Netflix, and Hulu. However, it does not support some audio modes for Plex (AAC 5.1). Also, the main reason for 4 out of 5 stars is that it sticks Amazon Prime videos down your throat. I don't want or have Amazon Prime so give me an option to hide or re-arrange my menu and it would be all good. The way it is, I have to click too many times to get through the Prime clutter to get to my apps that I want to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Mathias"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Install was painless, super happy with it so far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lisa Weisensale"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice to have but it wasn't as easy as it says to install it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "L.

What a mistake! It constantly loses internet connectivity (I do have it plugged in to power as it recommends) and buffers for five minutes then plays for 1.

I love the fact it comes with a remote.  I received the product when promised and it was very easy to set up and begin using.  Over the course of about 2 or 3 weeks however the remote would seem to stick.  It got to where when I tried to scroll up, down, left, or right to make selections the scrolling would not stop until it went as far in one direction as possible...can't just scroll 1 item as a time.

It can not keep network connectivity at all. I have no issue with other devices at home, but this streams for a couple minutes and then freezes or buffers. I have now read multiple reviews with the same comments but not anything from amazon on how to rectify. The box might be better to correct direct but the stick is not a good purchase if you want to stream off wifi. Boo amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jesseca L.
