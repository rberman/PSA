[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like the fire TV features and options. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had a power button and didn't have so many issues with Netflix App. Which is the main reason I purchased the fire TV. When you call to report the issue one tech will tells you that you have to reset the entire device which means you lose all data you have on the device. Another tells you something different.

As a Prime member, I had rarely taken advantage of the Prime instant videos since my \u201csmart\u201d TV is apparently only smart if one is only in elementary school and I was forced to view the Amazon content on a laptop.  FireTV seems to compliment Netflix well since it has a lot of content not found on Netflix and I find the Prime content has enough choices to make the purchase of the FireTV worthwhile. It should be noted I subscribe to Prime mostly for shipping, so Prime instant videos are a \u201cfreebie\u201d for us.Installation and setup: I have to say, installation and set up was a snap. I used the TotalMount system to mount it on my TV, and because the FireTV doesn\u2019t need line of sight to the remote, I installed the box on the back of my TV. The setup was anticlimactic since I expected to \u201cfight\u201d with getting the box to work and all I needed was the password to my router and it connected in a few seconds.Ease of use: While having to keep track of \u201canother\u201d remote wasn\u2019t appealing to me, the included remote is uncluttered and works well. The voice search function on the remote is top notch. I tried several searches, all successful, then handed it to my wife and it had no problems with the voice change. I bought a game controller for the FireTV, so I haven\u2019t tried to use the remote for gaming. Prime choices are clearly marked on the home/navigation screen with Prime Movies and Prime TV and are free to stream. However if you want to purchase them it will cost you.Loading: Loading of the initial games took a bit of time, but after first use they didn\u2019t seem to be any slower than loading a game on a PS3. We have watched several shows with the FireTV and have had ONE incident of a program buffering during the show, compared to Netflix this is a VAST improvement.Image quality: ExcellentAll-in-all, I\u2019m very satisfied with my purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "khagan1227"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Amazon Fire TV is great addition to our home entertainment system.
