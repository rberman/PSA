[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love. Love. Love this! The only disappointment I have is that Gary Busey wasn't the cartoon character on the guide through video.When looking into this before buying I was a little skeptic about how easy it would be to set up. Or if I would need to buy more just to hook it up a use it. But it came with everything needed right in the tiny box! Having a blast seeing and trying out every option and free app it has. Synced it with my phone and kindle. It is so user friendly. Can't wait to call the cable company and cancel all those useless cable channels. Going to save so much money in the upcoming years.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Kathy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Amazon Fire, it's become my entertainment center.

Pluses?  Yes. Great interface.  Beautiful picture at times.  But, like others reporting here, I'm getting a frustrating number of connection drops (it's not my wireless connection) and other hiccups.  Moreover it seems to suck up a lot more broadband than my other device (which I've had to go back to using).  I couldn't recommend this to a friend or neighbor...or you.  I hope Amazon does better with a later version.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Joe Oliver"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I bought this when it was first available, and soon gave it away. It's alright, but to be quite honest, given the fact that virtually anything you connect to your TV these days, if not the TV itself, does everything this device does and more, I'm not sure there's much of a point for most people. Do you have a Smart TV? Then you don't need this. Do you have an Xbox 360, PS3, PS4, Xbox One or Wii U? Then you don't need this. Do you have an Apple TV or a Roku? Then you don't need this. Do you have a Chromecast? Then you don't need this.The list goes on. There's nothing wrong with it per se--it does what it's advertised to do--it's just that, so does everything else these days.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "J.

We had Google chrome but figured it was worth trying out since I was offered the initial discount pricing for it when it was coming out. I love all the apps it offers, that I can have Hulu, prime, and Netflix all included along with history channel, ect. We actually cancelled our cable because of this thing!! I didn't like that with the Google chrome I had to stream things from my phone or tablet to watch them and my boyfriend couldn't get the hang of that (he doesn't do tech stuff). This is simple to use, has a remote, and functions very well! We haven't had more than 1 issue with connectivity and I think that was our internet.Overall it's a GREAT BUY, you can get rid of cable, includes a ton of apps, and has a wonderful interface. The only change I would make is if they could set up Netflix a little more like the iPad and desktop apps where you can search for things. The search feature on the home page only seems to pull up Amazon prime stuff- and sometimes the things you have to pay to watch on prime are free on Hulu or Netflix,", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica Meagan \"girl_w_style\""}]
