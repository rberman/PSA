If you don't like paying for tv then this is the item for you.

I didn't realize it sends a signal back to google's server(?) - presumably so they can track even more of what I do online.  So it doesn't work with a VPN which we have to use b/c we are stationed overseas (military) - unless we buy a new router which then tacks on to the price and my hassle.  So we can't watch netflix which was one of the biggest reasons I bought it.  Also it doesn't work with \"older\" equipment, which apparently my computer is now (it's not that old).  Also it was kind of a pain to set up.  I think if I understood the limitations before I bought it, well, I wouldn't have bought it, but also I wouldnt' have been disappointed.  But google paints it as amazing and working with everything.  It doesn't. I'm not sure it even works with the regular internet but only certain apps - I'm not positive about this, I haven't tried it since I need the vpn. Blergh. It maybe was worth the $29 I paid, but not more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cat7il"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It wouldn't work with my Sony Bravia TV. I called customer service and learned they had some unresolved issues when used on this brand and series. They don't know why yet. However, it would work with my wife's Panasonic TV. Unfortunately , that's not the TV I had wanted hooked up for Chromecast. If your considering this purchase, It may be a good idea to call Google's Customer Service (quite knowledgeable) first to see if they've had any issues with your brand. Had this worked, I would give this product 5 stars for doing what it says it will do. But, I don't know how much of a need there is to broadcast shows from a computer or cell phone to a TV. Why not just buy a Roku 3, it has a simple remote that is very easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MAGstar"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "however most hotels have a firewall preventing use on their tv's.  easy to set up from ipad or laptop.  that's all I got.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mary Palmer \"pilot\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I purchased the Chromecast player for my \"dumb\" TV.
