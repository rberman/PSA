More than anything, it's fast.  I'm used to waiting for load times using apps on a bluray player, this works almost instantly both for amazon video as well as netflix and other apps.  Plus, it is small and unobtrusive so it ends up feeling like it is just built into the TV.  I got it for $20 as a prime member before they went on public sale, I wish I had bought 4 of them so I could have one on every TV in the house.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christopher C.
