Nevertheless, we have the occasional glitch in which the signal is dropped, and we usually have to turn off the TV and start from scratch to reconnect. Annoying! We bought the Fire TV Stick in hopes of avoiding this problem.So far--2 weeks--the Stick has performed reasonably well, although jumping from the TV remote to the Stick remote and vice-versa is inconvenient. And the black-on-black navigation ring and select button are impossible to see in a dimly lit room. One possible advantage of the Stick is that when we still have the occasional glitch, we don't lose the signal. Instead, the video stalls while the audio continues. After a matter of seconds, the video recovers and races until it catches up with the audio again. Disconcerting, but less inconvenient than having to turn off the TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Stue Potts \"shippee\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So glad that I bought this!

The only thing it shows you is plugging it into the TV, but it doesn't show whatto do with the other end. Is the USB cable just to charge the stick. I thought this was suppose  to be wireless. I can't really see the difference.  CAN I PLUG IT INTO MY NOTE BOOK AND IF SO HOW?  HELP PLEASE", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Kathleen M Ives"}]
