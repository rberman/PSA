[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "My Chromecast has replaced a combination of an Xbox 360 and a Mac Mini, in terms of streaming capabilities, and now instead of having to chase down a controller or a wireless mouse and keyboard whenever my wife and I want to watch something (bonus difficulty: a small child will have been playing in the living room, and is guaranteed to have moved everything lighter than the couch at least twice), we just pull out a smartphone or the iPad. It might not seem like a huge deal to save a minute or two of searching, but those minutes really add up over a week or month. Add that to the fact that, by the time you've finally gotten through your day and shepherded a child through the bedtime routine, a question as simple as, \"Hey, have you seen the wireless mouse?\" can be soul-shattering, and the Chromecast is suddenly worth its weight in gold.Setup was easy, using it is very straightforward, and it is supported by all the streaming options we have wanted to use. We have had our Chromecast for nearly a month, using it at least a few minutes of basically every day, and I am extremely happy with the purchase. This would be a great value at a significantly higher cost.There are a few small issues that annoy me, but none of them are major and they do not make me regret buying the Chromecast in any way:1) The screensaver has some text on it that doesn't move or change, making it not really a screensaver so much as a destroyer of plasma TVs. Turning the TV off when we are done streaming is a pretty easy solution to this problem, but it's sort of silly having a screensaver that is actually worse at saving my screen than if I were to just leave a video on loop. Word is that an update in the near future should allow for some sort of customization on the screensaver, which might fix this issue.2) Sometimes, during playback (it seems to happen mostly with the WatchESPN app) the casting app will lose contact with the Chromecast. Generally this isn't a huge problem as the video continues playing, but it means I have to toggle the cast button to regain control of playback. It's just as likely that the app is misbehaving, rather than the Chromecast, but I can't really say for sure and either way it's a minor annoyance.3) The setup, while easy, is not extremely flexible, in that you essentially pair your Chromecast with one wifi setup and then pair any devices you have (smartphones, tablets, etc.) to your Chromecast. This is perfectly fine on its own, but it presents a minor drawback. For example, if I bring my Chromecast to a friend's house, which is otherwise extremely convenient on account of it weighing like ten ounces, I have to do the full setup at their house, and then re-do it again when I go home, instead of being able to just add their wifi setup to a list like you would with your smartphone. This lack of roaming capability seems like more of an oversight than a technical hurdle, and could absolutely be fixed in an update, but I haven't read anything indicating it is being worked on.Again, these are all minor issues, and have not prevented me from loving my Chromecast. If you use YouTube, Hulu, HBOGo, WatchESPN, Netflix, or Plex on a regular basis, the only reason I could come up with for you to not get a Chromecast is that you do not have a TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
