And I'm wondering if this is just one more thing that they'll get people to buy...only to stop any real improvements within a few months.  I really wish they would put the investment in time and money into the GTV devices.In reality, because of the 3 months of free Netflix, which brings this price to about $12, it is worth it just for the \"play-around\" value or for that 4th TV you have in the guest room.  However, this is not a 5 star item.  Just because it does what it says it will, that alone does not cut it for me.  Someone could sell a pet rock on here and say, \"all it does it lay there\"...but is that reason enough to give it 5 stars?  This is a media streaming device and you can't ignore how it compares to other streaming devices.Many have already listed pros and cons, here are a few that I haven't read about yet.1) Only TV Speakers - This plugs into your TV, so unless you have a setup audio setup that brings the sound from your TV to your stereo, you will be watching Netflix only through your TV speakers2) No Surround Sound - In an attempt to get the audio to my speakers, I plugged the Chromecast device into the HDMI input on my Logitec Revue.  (I don't run my Dish receiver through it anyway) It actually worked.  The sound did route to my stereo system, however, it was not surround sound...only stereo.  This same movie playing on Netflix through my PS3 was surround sound.3) Poor Browser Streaming - Streaming HBO GO from my Windows 7 computer's Chrome browser was less than satisfactory.  Obviously, this can be improved if you hard wire your computer to the router, but for many, that's not convenient.4) HDMI Port - Obviously, it takes up a HDMI port, however, Google did a pass through on their Revue Google TV device, why not do it here as well.To be fare, it does what it says, but what it does do, is pretty underwhelming.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "4/25", "author": "gkbuls"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For around thirty-five dollars, you can't beat this streaming device.  The ability to kick off a YouTube video or Netflix film from your phone or tablet is convenient and fast!  Luckily, I was able to snag one of these devices early.  But there's lots of questions as to what this can and can do:(11-17-2014: Updated to remove some outdated information)What do I need to use this?You need an iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) device with iOS 6 or late or an Android device with version 2.3 or later, and a WiFi connection in your home.  You'll probably also want a subscription to a streaming media service like Netflix or Hulu, but it's not required.Does this use my phone's data plan?No, your phone and and the Chromecast must be on the same WiFi network.  Most communication happens between the internet and the Chromecast (and not your phone).Won't this drain my phone or tablet's battery?Streaming from officially supported services (Netflix and Youtube) happens from the cloud.  Your device only serves as a remote, so it won't drain your battery like typical streaming would.  However, streaming a webpage from the Chrome browser on your PC or Mac does happen from your computer, so it would likely drain your battery faster.Does Windows XP or Linux work with Chromecast?No, not at this time.  At launch time, Chromecast tab streaming only works with Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7. and 10.8, and Chrome OS on the Chomebook Pixel only (other Chromebooks MAY be supported in the future).Do I need a certain processor, amount of RAM, etc for Chrome Tab streaming?Google recommends Core i3 or newer, or a Macbook Pro 2010 or Macbook Air 2011 or later to stream standard quality video.  Please note that \"officially\" supported apps (Netflix and YouTube) stream from the cloud and do not require certain hardware on your computer.How do I power the device?The Chromecast comes with a power cord and a power adapter to plug it into the wall.  If your TV has a USB port, you can try plugging the Chromecast's power cord in there instead.  It may power your device without needing to use the power adapter.How do I setup the device?The setup process is easy, but you will need a computer with WiFi (like a laptop) or your phone to setup the Chromecast.  Just go to the website that the Chromecast shows on your screen when you first plug it in.What services are supported?Netflix, Hulu Plus, Crackle, YouTube, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and a lot more.  You can find an official list on Chromecast's website.  Sadly, Amazon Video is not supported at this time (and since they have their own streaming stick, it likely won't be supported on the Chromecast).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "31/41", "author": "Ryan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Had this plugged in for a few hours so far, and love it!  Plugged it into the HDMI and USB (for power) on my TV, switched to that input and it fired right up!  Used my phone to quickly configure it and go!  So far zero issues.  Streams YouTube well from my phone, tablet and desktop.  Right now streaming some Music from my tablet, and no issues.  It is nice enough to move the album art around the TV about every 20 seconds to prevent burn.I am using the extender right now, but may remove it.  I believe I have enough room.A note to people: You have to use a wireless device with the Chromecast application to do the initial setup.  That is a WIRELESS device!  When you do the initial setup it seems to do a point-to-point wireless connection to the Chromecast device so that you can join your home wireless network.Overall, from unboxing to using, took me less than 5 minutes.  Chromecast doesn't seem to support the 5GHz wireless spectrum, so I had to join it to my 2.4GHz network.  Not a huge issue, but be warned if you try to connect to your 5GHz wireless network.Another tip: make sure to install the \"Google Cast\" extension for Chrome on your computers and the \"Chromecast\" app on your mobile device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "10/15", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I picked one of these up from Best Buy today. It is a great product at a great price. I received an email with my free Netflix code before I even left the store. The setup was extremely simple and took maybe 3 or 4 minutes. I am using a Samaung Galaxy Tab 2 and it works effortlessly, although when I tried it on my iPhone 5 it said it is not yet supported on this device. Netflix and YouTube worked perfectly without any pauses for buffering which I frequently got on the Xbox 360. The surround sound worked perfectly as and the videos were clear and crisp with no fuzziness or distortion. The free Netflix code worked fine on my current account which I think is great. It is a great device for the price and I am excited for them to add more apps soon. For those complaining about the Chrome mirroring not being perfect remember that Google specifically states that it is in Beta which obviously means it won't work perfectly as it is still in test mode...

To stream from Chrome on a laptop you just download the app and can then cast whatever tab you want to your TV.Netflix and YouTube on the iPhone are already good to go.Testing some videos from YouTube and Vimeo, the quality is fantastic.Another nice feature is the Chromecast automatically kicks over to the HDMI input if you're watching regular TV and click cast. No need to find your TV remote and press input.Semi-downside - Need to power via a USB port. Good news is that a USB port on the back of my TV makes powering the Chromecast a snap.Downside - Sites like Vimeo etc. don't have the ability to cast yet, so if you want to view fullscreen on the TV, you can't switch to another tab.Should be interesting to see what the app developers come up with for this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "16/23", "author": "Grant Gannon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Picked up my Chromecast at Best Buy today ( I also have one on order with Amazon ).

Specifically,the image is \"zoomed in\",resulting in the top, bottom, left, and right being cut off. This is particularly noticeable in videos with text near the bottom. I tweaked all the settings (Full Screen Zoom, Auto-Resize) but neither remediated the issue. Worth noting that I tried this on three separate devices (Nexus 7, Galaxy S3, and Chromebook) and all had the same issue.VOLUME:It would really be a lot better if the volume when chromecasting would stay consistent. Regardless of the device it goes to max volume when you cast for the first time, which means you have to scramble to reduce the noise to manageable levels. Worth noting that the Nexus and Galaxy allowed for adjusting volume through the default volume controls while the Chromebook did not.The volume issue is manageable, but the zoom problem is a big deal. I'll be troubleshooting with some other TVs to see if the problem persist and will adjust my score accordingly if it is just THIS TV that is the issue.7/26/2013 Update:It turns out it is specific to the TV. I tried it on a second TV and had the same issue but it was easy to resolve with by changing the display setting from 16:9 to \"Scan\". Unfortunately no setting tweaks were able to resolve anything for the TV downstairs (only has 16:9,Zoom, and 4:3 options)so I don't think there is a likely solution. The TV is likely the guilty culprit as opposed to the chromecast, so raised this to four stars.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "14/22", "author": "Jaegan"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "UPDATE: I wrote the review below when the Netflix promo was going on.  It seems that promo has been canceled, so just disregard mentions to it.I got the last one at my local Best Buy (sorry to everyone behind me).  If you are currently paying $8 per month for Netflix than this Chromecast will effectively cost you $11 after you apply the 3 months of free Netflix to your account.  For $11 I rate this between 4-5 stars.  I want to rate it 5 but I'm having 1 issue with it that I'll get into in a minute.Setup is easy.  Plug the unit into the HDMI outlet of your TV.  If your TV's HDMI does not supply power (mine doesn't and I just got it last month) you have to use the included USB power adapter (or you can plug it into your TV's USB port if you have one).  After switching to the appropriate HDMI input on your TV you'll see the Chromecast prompting you to visit a website on you PC.  At the website you'll download the Chromecast setup app, run it, it will detected the Chromecast(s) on your network (if it works), name them, enter your network key, and you're done.The app will automatically install a new Chrome browser extension on your PC.  A little button that you can click to mirror the webpage onto your TV.  I tried it on some simple webpages and some streaming media sites.  The simple text websites mirrored perfectly.  The streaming media mirrored but was a bit choppy (they were Flash format I think).  Using the YouTube and Netflix Apps on my Iphone to stream movies to it worked without problem.Another really cool feature is, if your TV is CEC enabled, the Chromecast can turn on your TV and/or switch to the appropriate HDMI input when you send a stream command to it.Now for my one issue; the app you need to download to your PC to activate the Chromecast on your network did not work on my desktop PC.  It's a Win7 pc connected to my router via Ethernet (router is dual-band).  So I tried the app on my Win7 laptop connected via wifi to the same network and it worked.  Once the Chromecast is activated you don't need the PC unless you want to mirror something from Chrome.  Google's help page states this issue may happen on dual-band routers and I should deactivate \"AP (access point) isolation\" in my routers settings.  I couldn't locate any setting similar to that so I have a help request pending with Google.All in all this is good for $35 and Epic for $11.  It won't replace my Roku, but I'm excited to see all the Chrome extensions and Apps that will be designed to work with it in the future (XBMC I'm looking at you).PS: If anyone finds a work around for that setup issue please comment.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "9/13", "author": "Ld"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Nowhere does it say you cannot setup Chromecast with an ios device.

Sometimes it seems to lose the iPhone, but just shutting down the iPhone and restarting connects them up.  The streaming is working very well for me, even on an average DSL connection.  Hopefully I will get the Netflex rebate, time will tell.  I had ordered well before the cutoff time.  Other than the setup snafu and occasional burp with the iPhone I am every happy with it.
