I am a movie junkie, and being able to link my prime, netflix, hbo, showtime, and starz all into one place, with one remote.....Amazing! I would have paid over $100 for something like this, and I can't believe it was only $39! It only took like 15 minutes to set up & link all of the accounts to it too. I highly recommend this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "James Farmer"}]
