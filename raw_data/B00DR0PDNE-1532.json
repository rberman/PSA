We had to move the router within 15 feet since we have all of our electronics in a cupboard. The dongle itself does not have a very good wireless card in it at all, and its signal will disconnect a million times and make you pretty frustrated if it isn't in range or in an open area to pick up the transmission. Luckily we didn't mind moving our router into the closet, and will eventually get a Powerline Adaptor (Adaptors that plugs into your wall outlet and uses it as an internet line) so we can move it out of there to let the further points in the house get back their higher signals!Definitely worth it. We don't have cable; just internet. Kid loves it!
