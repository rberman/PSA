My wife and I bought the Fire TV Stick to replace an old, ailing Roku box, and we're very pleased with it. Set-up and connecting to our home wi-fi was very simple and took only a few minutes, after which the device checked for software updates, then we were ready to go. We're using the Fire TV Stick primarily for streaming Amazon Instant Video to our TV, and it works great. I installed the Fire TV app on my Kindle Fire HDX 7\" tablet, and it also works very well. I especially like being able to search for movies and TV shows with voice commands from the app, which you can't do from the Fire TV remote control.I haven't used a Google Chromecast or Roku Streaming Stick, so I can't compare the Fire TV Stick to them, but so far I'm very pleased with the Amazon product, which is ideal for anyone who's heavily into the Amazon environment of instant video, music, and games.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
