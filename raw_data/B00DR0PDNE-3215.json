The set up was easier than expected (and I expect a lot from Google). Within 5 minutes of plugging the device into my TV, we were up and running and watching a show on Netflix. The picture was much better than the same show being played thru my BlueRay device. I am gobsmacked. I'm now closer to \"slinging\" all my shows from my devices (iPad, iPhone, Nexis 7, and various laptops). Shortly I will be able to cancel my AT&T; Uverse account!
