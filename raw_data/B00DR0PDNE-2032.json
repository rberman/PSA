Wakelin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I had originally purchased one of these for work where we now use it to drive a large 50\" monitor in our lobby as a welcoming display.  It worked so well that I decided to get one for my home.  Plus I'm a gadget freak and couldn't pass it up for the price.There seems to be a lot of confusion about what this does and doesn't do.  Let me try to help the cause a bit here.  You connect this to one of your tv's HDMI inputs.  [To note, at home I have this connected through my Onkyo media system].  The device also requires power...here you have two options: 1) use the included power adapter and plug that into a standard 110v household outlet, 2) use one of the USB ports on your television (if so equipped) to power the unit.  The cable included with the Chromecast serves both options.Once connected and powered on, you switch your television's HMDI input to the one that has the Chromecast inserted.  You are guided through a series of very simple steps to configure the Chromecast to use your home WiFi and apply any updates that may be available.  Once configured, the device goes into a default mode which displays beautiful and interesting photographs from around the world some of which are quite breathtaking.  But of course, you're not buying one of these just to look at pretty pictures (or maybe you are :) )OK, so here's the long and the short of it: the Chromecast is a WiFi signal RECEIVER to which you SEND a signal from any device capable of running either Chrome browser or Chrome OS (read: Chromebook).  This includes tablets, phablets, phones, Windows laptops, etc etc etc.  There is a Chrome extension (or app depending on your device) that allows you to broadcast either the current Chrome tab OR your entire device's screen.If you can see and hear it on your device...you can see and hear it on the Chromecast (vis a vis your television).Overall, I have found the performance to be very good both at home and the one at work.  Depending on the speed/performance of your TRANSMITTING device, any WiFi issues, and the quality of the video/audio being sent to the Chromecast you may experience some stuttering or hesitation at times.  I have not found this to be a major drawback.So what are the uses?  Well, here's just a couple of examples from my experience.  As mentioned, at work it drives a customizable graphic display in our lobby (like you see in banks) which shows a series of slides about the company and any specific welcoming messages we may have for special guests.  At home, we use it to watch catch up's of our favorite TV shows that are available online.  I use (and love) my Chromebook [yes, using it now] and \"broadcast\" the tv show from the site on my Chromebook to our 60\" television via the Chromecast connected through our Onkyo media system.  I am also able to use this configuration as an \"external monitor\" for my Chromebook such as when I'm doing research on ancestory.com.  By broadcasting to the 60\" screen I am able to actually READ the fineprint of documents that are available online.Simply put, you can use it for just about anything.  More and more sites/apps are providing built-in support for the Chromecast (e.g. Netflix, youtube) which display the Chromecast icon which you just click on to begin broadcasting.For it's low cost and what I anticipate to be continual upgrades and improvements from Google, you really can't go wrong with this purchase.

Using this dongle your stuck with Googles limitations. As in limited to certain streaming websites. There is also no remote so you have to have your host device next to you, laptop, desktop, phone, whatever, to use it as a remote. This dongle also does not support all popular video formats so good luck streaming your local media.
