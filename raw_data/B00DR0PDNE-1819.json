[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I returned this product as I felt cheated. You can't play any desktop videos. You can only play the streaming videos.What really bothered me was that I couldn't use my extended desktop feature with this. When I use normal HDMI cable, I open Netflix in a a new window and drag it to the extended desktop screen that's connected to TV while I still could do my work on the laptop if I wanted to. Long HDMI cable comes at 5-5 dollars.

It's okay.  It's a great solution for people who want to stream things like Hulu or Netflix occasionally and don't want to spend very much.  The biggest thing to realize is that the Chromecast itself does not play content, it only receives it.  So in order to watch content you have to connect another device such as a computer, iPhone, Android etc. and stream it from your device to the Chromecast.  For everyday viewing I would find this annoying compared to an AppleTV or Roku where you can just sit down, turn on the TV and navigate to what you want to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Pharaohman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it--simple to install.
