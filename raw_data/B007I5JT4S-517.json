My only frustration with this is that only Apple ID can be used to control the Apple TV. This is annoying for a mixed family with music, apps, etc. on different devices. Yes, it is easy to log in to the remote app with the one Apple ID, but I really would prefer that weren't necessary.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kayla"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I first bought a ROKU for accessing Amazon Prime but wanted another device for the other TV. I decided to go with the Apple TV. By using a remote desktop app like splashtop or logmein you still can share your movie playing on your computer through your ipad to the Apple TV..quality is not to bad.

Don't believe me look at the latest breaking news on the product that Apple is working on a deal with Time Warner Cable, WTF?
