[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "In my short experience with this device, I was able to watch movies/shows from Youtube, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Rabbit TV quite seamlessly. It's not for games, it's for video-watching. If I worked for the cable companies, I would be very afraid. One night, after recording Grimm on our Comcast DVR, it wouldn't play. It kept hanging up when we tried to play it.I brought the show up on Hulu Plus, and was watching it in minutes. I really believe that if your a bust person that watched TV when you want, the combination of Netflix/Hulu Plus/Rabbit TV/Chromecast will keep you happy in couch potato mode for as long as you like.Of course, you need good Wi-Fi :-)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "well-read and still learning"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have bought one of these for each TV in the house.

I gave mine away to a friend that doesn't have those things but I may buy another one just to have for vacations. I do travel quite a bit and think this will be perfect for that.

Here's the thing: if you own/going to buy a Smart TV that has Netflix and Youtube on it, then the Chromecast is a WASTE of money. The Chromecast plugs into the tv allowing you to stream stuff to your HDTV. I do believe that Google will be allowing other services to cast eventually.I saved alot of money when choosing my HDTV because I already subscribe to Netflix. I don't need all the extras on a SmartTv. Setup is easy, and don't forget the plug-in at the very end. Got one for my sister as well.There is another thing the Chromecast can do: you can wireless stream your local files to your HDTV. Google Chrome has an extension that puts the Chromecast tab into Chrome and some minor setup. I've done it on mine. But there are some flaws.The streaming is sometimes slow, so watching videos gets choppy or buffers randomly. You can turn your TV into a HUGE desktop if you wish.I've even managed to get my Kindle Fire HD to Cast my content onto my HDTV. I'm not going to get into specifics. I've had all that set-up since February of this year.Reminder: If you have a SmartTV-----NO Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "B.
