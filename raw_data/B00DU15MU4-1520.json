[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This makes watching movies so much easier. We were watching a cartoon version of Anastasia and someone said \"lets watch the Yule Brenner version\"... In under two minutes we were watching the movie.  This totally trumps the \"smart tv\" functions on my tv- at least the tv is still a great high resolution monitor.My only beef is the voice search does not work on other platforms. When I search Netflix I still have to toggle through the keyboard. I understand this will probably help Amazon generate additional revenue due to the lazy factor but it is annoying when the title is not available on Amazon and needs to be searched in Netflix or another source.  Please fix that Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott Rudd \"LSRL\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far so good.
