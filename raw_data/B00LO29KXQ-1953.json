I love the user interface,and how easy it is to set up. Not only am I able to stream different apps like Netflix and Hulu Plus. I can also use AllCast to stream movies from my phone to my fire stick. My one negative would be that it often loses connection randomly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "julius johnson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works really well with SlingTV!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Laura P"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mike"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Conrado Contreras"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Its only limitation is the wonderful programming that is an additional charge from Prime and Netflix limits to DVDs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

Great being able to hide it behind the TV.  It even comes with an HDMI extender if you can't have it sticking straight out due to wall mounting.  WIFI range is outstanding and includes both 2.4 and 5 ghz.  App available that allows your phone to function as remote and works fantastic.  Amazon even has the stick setup to recognize your account straight out of the box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Public Reviewer # 1"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angie Hoffmann"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I absolutely love this device.
