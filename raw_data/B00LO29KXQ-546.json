The stick behind a big screen tv seems to loose communication with the remote, so you press ti button once then when in the sling tv app the stick will think multiple presses have been made. So thinking use the extension short cord that comes with it to get it away from the tv so it can get a better signal still no help. So the stick is a great buy with smaller tv's or better placed HDMI ports, i have a 50 in Vizio UHD.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sean"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "5 stars nuff said", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian Myers"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Thrilled with my new Amazon Fire TV Stick.
