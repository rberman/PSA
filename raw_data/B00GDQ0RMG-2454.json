Also, why is there a \"rent now\" on a movie/show that is also a \"watch now\" in Prime... makes zero sense.  The UX of navigation of what is prime and what is to buy/rent needs to be within it's own categories of search... that would gain a 5th star from me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Randy B."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Its really nice not having to run movies and TV through a gaming console.
