It had to download each time I used it  and was very slow. After turning it on the third time it took me back to the point of being new and just purchased.Being so frustrated in attempting to use it I packed it up and returned it to the store.I even had the assistance of my 21 year old, who also was disappointed in the performance.Later we were informed by 3 different people that Roku was better and more user friendly. At this time I will continue to use my Kindle Fire with a HDMI cord connection. Works and very user friendly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joy R"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It doesn't Works outsider US", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Claudia Perez Rueda"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Megan DeGrote"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lynn"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great stuff, easy to install and provide too many more apps than other devices like apple tv", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cristian Encina"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The stick works great!
