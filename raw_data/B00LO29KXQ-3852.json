I previously bought a miracast dongel and found the setup very complicated.  This was basically plug and play.  The only downside that I have to report is the VIDEO LIBRARY AND WATCHLIST can't be separated from films and tv shows.

It's small, feature-packed, and affordable. What I dislike though is the WiFi streaming issues it has - my Fire TV stick is about ten inches away from my router, and regardless of whether or not I have it on the 2.4 Ghz or the 5 Ghz network, I routinely get Netflix quality drops (where it goes from HD to SD) and it stops to re-buffer. I see no such issues on the Roku units I use. I don't know what the issue is exactly, but overall I don't find the Fire TV Stick to be reliable at Netflix streaming, which is the primary reason I bought it. I'm hoping a future firmware update will improve the reliability. It also doesn't have a UFC.tv app, but I don't fault Amazon for that yet - I'm assuming they're working on that, and many other, partnerships.UPDATE: Well, it's been a few months now, and nothing has changed. The Fire TV sputters and stutters regularly, making for a fairly frustrating experience some days. Amazon really needs to work on optimizing the video playback experience.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jason Dunn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic, as advertised.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "juanita grinter West Chester, Oh"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "A little slow to hook up each time with network, but otherwise works fine", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John L.
