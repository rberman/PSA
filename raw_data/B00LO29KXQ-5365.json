But I really was looking for an easy way to watch Amazon Prime content and also listen to Spotify on my TV.  When the Fire TV Stick came out, I couldn't say no. It was super easy to set up and the remote and on screen menus are excellent.  I really enjoy this product and since it also supports Netflix I rarely use my Apple TV any longer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steve Cornelius"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really like the fire stick.

Dickinson"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Amazon made me believe on their advertisements that their Fire TV Stick was simply plug in and use. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In addition to plugging the device into your TV, you must also plug in an ugly wire for a power adapter directly to the Fire TV Stick. At this point, I feel like I had been deceived by false advertising. Aside from that, the device is fine, though I still prefer either the Roku or Apple interface. Can't beat the price though, as I picked it up with the extra initial discount being a Prime member.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bennett"}]
