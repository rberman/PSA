I have been a long time Amazon Prime member and this gives you easy access to their services.  The other thing I like about it is that you can easily view photos and videos stored on your Amazon cloud drive.  I don't have Netflix so I can't speak for that but the ease of using this device is great.  I also have a Roku 2 and have not noticed any significant differences in the quality of the sound or picture between the two.  This one is definitely much easier to travel with also.  The only thing I don't like is having to plug the stick into an external power source although I'm not sure there is much you can do about that.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a streaming stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dusty F."}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Netflix quit working, Amazon tech support could not solve problem.

One issue is that it keeps signing me out of Netflix which requires me to enter in username and password.  I think this might be intentional to steer me towards Prime Video rather than Netfilx.  While the Prime Video library is close to Netflix there are some things over and above Netflix Originals that aren't on Prime ... like Dexter.It also has one click to Amazon videos and requires you to sign into Netflix and then browse the Netflix library.Missing HBO Go and Rdio (and others ... see the Wired review which compares sticks and streaming players)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Richard"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Meh.I'll keep my DirecTV.  Sure, it's expensive, but I don't have to wait, in some cases, weeks for new shows to appear.  I've instead gone with an IOGEAR HDMI signal repeater, and just transmit to the upstairs TV.Don't get me wrong, I like the idea, and the audio/video quality of the two movies we watched using it was just fine, it's just not up to channel-surfing, yet.  Probably in another few years, though there is a very definite hurdle with programming costs, commercials to pay for said costs, and the fact that right now, you can record something, then just fast-forward through the commercials at a quite rapid rate.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "kellyb"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Much more user friendly than google chrome.
