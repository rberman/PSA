I was under the impression that it operated like the Google Chromecast where you could project what is on your device's screen to your television that the Stick is plugged into. This is essentially no different than a Roku. It's great if that's what you want, but it is not at all what I needed. I personally when with the Google option as I am able to view literally ANY content through the Google Chrome web browser and spit it directly to whatever television that the Chromecast is plugged into. This way, you are not restricted to just apps. If you can access it through the internet, you can see it on your television. In my honest opinion, go with the Chromecast, you are allowed way more freedom of content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Freezes!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Beth Heltzel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lori Culley"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Have trouble connecting to wifi at times", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "natasha potter"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I only have 3G on my cell so I can't get uninterupted reception.
