Spends more time buffering than it does playing.Tried contacting Amazon Cust. Service and no results. I am glad i got it for 19.99 because at 39.99 I would have been terribly upset instead of just genuinely dissatissfied. If there was a warning to be sure of it was that they picked Gary Busey to hawk this sea shell, I would have to be as crazy as he is to ever consider buying this.I will sell mine for 19.99 you can get it for half off the selling price since IT DOESN'T WORK....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "raymond beers"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I plan to update this... but it worked great until after Christmas.
