[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Incredibly simple to set up and it works great.  Combined with our Amazon Prime account this has saved us the cost or rentals and trips to red box.  I really like who it automatically loads on to the TV when I hit the home button, without having to a different line in when I want to watch a movie or video.  Great product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert G.
