I have read online that this is a common problem with streaming anything other than the few sources that are promoted for the product (Netflix, etc). I have very high speed internet and stream videos at the lowest quality and it still doesn't work. Once you set it up, you find out this is only the beta version of their software and that says a lot. I've had this product for about 4 months now and still no software updates. Not to mention you can only stream from Chrome, not other browsers, nor from iTunes, and Chrome on Apple barely ever blocks pop-up ads - very annoying!It is a waste of money until they fix their streaming problems.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Wiren"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this device.
