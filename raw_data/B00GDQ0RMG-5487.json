[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I'll consider this little thing \"beta.\" For the $19 pre-order price, it's just about a value, provided Amazon will do some updating.Pros:- Decent UI. Best option I found for streaming Amazon Prime.- Small.- Can't complain too much for the price.Cons:- UI stutters and hangs frequently.- Every -- and I mean: EVERY -- episode or movie watched will stutter for a few seconds until the buffering is done.- Ridiculously poor placement of the power-supply (microUSB) jack. Take a clue from ChromeCast! Placing it on the side will inevitably restrict where the FireTV Stick can be used without blocking the HDMI port next to it.- Remote is unreliable. I often need to press it a second or third time to wake it up.- Wifi dies regularly... video playback will stop, the device will suggest going to network settings, and not a single network will be found. Needs powercycle to recover.- No way to stream locally hosted videos without PLEX -- which costs $5 and requires their spyware/server running inside your network.- Restricted to Amazon's \"app store\" -- so if you already purchased certain apps in the proper app-store, you get to buy them all again.- No decent way to provide shortcuts on the home screen -- i.e. weather? Favorite item from the watch list?- Haphazard parental controls and no filtering capabilities at all -- yes, we can restrict purchases, but what if I want to block/hide all content rated PG-13 and above? I personally don't watch R-rated garbage either, so I don't want to see it, thankyouverymuch, and certainly not have my children exposed.One of the two stars here is value-for-money. A streaming Android Device for $20 is a decent value, even though it's lacking quite a few features. In practice, it's restricted to playing very limited content, and really just Amazon Prime Video -- and for that, it really ought to be free. The other star is unbridled optimism that Amazon will take the feedback seriously and improve this thing... and if they don't, that the major gaps in functionality will be filled by fellow app developers.Amazon -- work with Plex and make it free, or develop your own.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "F. Lastname"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The first couple days I was frustrated--it was disconnecting and I was only able to play a couple of brief videos.  Then I connected it to a TV in another room and it came to life.  So, even if it says your wifi signal is very good, it may not be good enough.  I bought an HDMI extension and put it back on the original TV and it's working great.  It's now worth seeing what Amazon Prime movies have to offer and I'm up to Season 1 Episode 5 of The Walking Dead on Netflix with no buffering or hitches.  And I'm even playing a cool pinball game on my big TV.  Very cool.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "justmytwocents"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "When I received my Fire TV Stick the streaming was terrible.  Every couple of seconds it stopped to \"buffer\".  Tried turning all devices using WiFi off and it still struggled.  I rebooted the stick with no luck to better streaming.  I also added in the HDMI extender cable, again with no luck to better streaming. I called Amazon and the wait time was nonexistent. They helped me obtain an update and now it's working perfectly. I'm glad the customer service was great!  I do wish this had the Rhapsody app though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amanda Essink"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Chromecast pales in comparison.

I've never had problems working with them before.The device behaves as follows: Device initializes/boots, prompt to press the play/pause button to continue, scans and finds available WiFi networks, I select my WiFi network and enter the correct password for authentication (all other wireless devices in my household connect successfully, so yes it is the correct password), the device states it successfully connected, and it checks for updates.Note: At this point there may be an issue as it just moves right along as it found no updates.Next the device asks me to select my Amazon account or to use a different account, and I select my Amazon account. The device states \"successfully registered\". The next screen is \"checking network speed\" after this it displays a blank screen for several minutes with no error messages, codes, etc. It displays nothing.The device reboots, and redirects back to the very first screen (press play/pause to continue) as though it is starting up for the very first time. Then it proceeds to go through the exact same first-time initialization steps that I just outlined.I spoke with Amazon support, and they walked me through the motions of basic troubleshooting. I have disconnected and reconnected the device several times with and without the HDMI extender/adapter. I have power cycled my network several times. I have tried the device in two different TVs, on every HDMI port available. I even tried with and without the HDMI adapter on all of those ports, and power cycled my network during that process several times.It behaves the same way every time. I even requested an exchange, and instead I received an email from Amazon stating I should try to troubleshoot the device by power cycling the network which I already did. They also recommend checking for updates through the settings menu, but as I already pointed out I haven't been able to get past the initial setup! I can't get the the HOME screen.I'm returning the device, and I guess I'll stick with my Roku which works perfectly fine connected via WiFi on my network.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "Nathan"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Missing some major Apps like Vudu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Winthrop"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Its a Snappy Device and easy to setup. i have a few so so feelings..wish the controller didn't click so loud when u hit a button and i'm not really into the User Interface Menu set up, would like if i could customize it and make it look cleaner. navigating to stuff is a'little messy.
