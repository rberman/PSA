I searched sporadically for quite some time on the web to see if anyone else had the problem and what might be the solution.  It seems that a many people had the problem, and many suggestions were offered, but no one had the solution.  Today (June 20, 2015) I ran across one person on the web who stated that he had solved the problem by replacing the USB cable that came with the Chromecast.  I decided to give it a try. I replaced the furnished cable with one that came with an Android mobile phone charger, and Voila!!, my problem was solved.  Works great (now).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "John E. Norris"}]
