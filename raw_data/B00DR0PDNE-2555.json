The Chromecast just simply doesn't do enough and it is frustrating.Using a Google tablet, I expected the Chrome browser to \"cast\" web pages onto my HDTV via chromecast.  Wrong - that only works with a laptop.  It won't work on tablets or smartphones.The Chromecast doesn't support Amazon Prime's Instant Video.Chromecast loses connectivity when used in conjunction with an iOS (iphone) device - a fairly well known problem now.I wanted to like this gadget but it is simply not up to do any real heavy lifting.  It plays Netflix and HBO GO.  Youtube, I don't use on the HDTV - it's something I use on the phone or tablet or computer.I felt misled - I thought this thing could project a web browser's content to my TV using a Google-branded Nexus7 running Chrome browser.  I guess not.  It does project a web browser from a laptop but even then, video content, local video files, just don't play.In the end, it's just not a useful device right now in its current state.  Needs more support from popular content streamers the way Roku is.  Not being able to cast a website, photo, or video clip from a tablet or smart phone kind of defeats the purpose for me.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "J.
