I use a Roku that was given to me as a gift and I recently purchased Prime and have been watching both Netflix and Prime on my Roku and Fire Stick with no problems.  I think the remote isn't as user friendly as it could be especially if you are watching YouTube but it's doable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "marylynn"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William Sutton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this thing!

THERE ARE APPS YOU CAN BUY FOR .99 - 6.00, ONE TIME FEE. BUT I AM SO BUSY WITH WHAT I HAVE ALREADY I DONT THEM. OH, DID I MENTION ALL THE CRIME SHOWS, DISCOVERY ID, EVIL KIN, ETC.  THE STICK IS THE SIZE OF A CELL PHONE, PLUGS IN TO TV AND WALL, AND THATS IT.
