They have a featured apps section and a new section.. but i just want a list of apps in alphabetical order so i can see what you have, maybe a \"by catergory\" section as well.  Did i miss something? because i had trouble finding some of the apps that are listed in the advertisement.Youtube app \"casting\" from phones, computers, tablets .. does NOT work.  it pops up a youtube symbol like all my other devices as if it's about to load (the device casting thinks it's playing or about to play on the fire tv) but it just doesn't.  It goes back to the regular youtube screen.  For now my work around is to play the item in question for a few seconds on the first device and then reload the history section on the fire tv so I can play it on the tv.  Annoying ... all my other devices work beautifully for that.  I love being able to throw stuff on the tv when showing it to friends. And they can do the same so long as they are logged on the same network. Now only I can do it with my work around as both the fire tv and your other device has to be logged into the same youtube account.No HBO Go ... prolly would still give it 5 stars without this.. def 4 stars if they fix the other two.
