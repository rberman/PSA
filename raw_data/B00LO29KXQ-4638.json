My one gripe, and the reason I've knocked stars off, is that performance wise the device is a little underwhelming. It might just be a case of poor internet connection or maybe something wrong with the device, but I often notice screen tears and stuttering while watching anything on the device. Considering the thing is literally about 2 feet from a modem, I don't know how it wouldn't be receiving a proper signal, especially when it's in use, nothing else is on that would sap signal strength.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "thistimeitswar \"semaJ\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I truly love this new Fire stick.  I purchased this when Amazon offered it to me for only $19!  I guess because I'm a Prime member... Now I wish I had ordered two or three for that price, because on the Amazon website it's showing they won't have any in until the middle of February.  My daughter's Wii stopped working back during the summer, so I had to find another streaming device to watch Amazon Instant Video and Netflix.  I went to Target and found the new Roku stick for $50.  I didn't want anymore streaming boxes, I wanted something that was more convenient and quick and easy to setup.  The Roku stick was ok (it kept on \"pausing\" a lot) until I got my Fire stick in the mail and set it up.  My Fire stick streams faster than the Roku, the only time it pauses is when it's raining real bad outside,  and the set up was way more convenient than Roku...I guess since I was already a Prime member, I didn't have to go through the steps that I did with the Roku stick...with the Roku I had to go online each and every time to setup Netflix, Amazon, HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, etc to watch anything from those places.  Instead of me putting in my Username and Password and start watching with the Fire stick.  I truly hope Amazon send me another deal on this stick like they did before, I would love to buy one for my daughter (I gave her the Roku stick), purchase one for the family room, and purchase 2 more for my sister and a family friend.  Also, If you don't want to use the power adapter they provide to you and if you have a USB port on your TV, then you can forgo plugging it into the power adapter so that you can more room on your power outlets.  GREAT PRICE, GREAT PRODUCT!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Lauren"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Get a Chromecast instead, lower price and better feature. Amazon is keeping Google out of its platform by refusing to make an app for the Android platform, but Amazon uses the Android platform to build its operating system. To use this sick, you will need to buy the apps even if you already bought the app for use on your device. This device is in a box unused as it another way for the company to try to extract money for you to buy apps you already have on your phone or tablet, Apple or  Android.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "mrsucram"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!
