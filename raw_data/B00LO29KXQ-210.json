[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product if you want to stop using gaming systems as a streaming system. The software responds fast, however it does have an issue every now and then where it can jump around the menu without you pushing a button, however that is rare. I like that you can tap into other networks apps to stream their content. Otherwise a solid product. I took a star away because i feel the firmware needs some bug fixes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Geoffrey \"Steel Toast\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Good tool for accessing free or cheap content online.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jon D.

The menu is fast and responsive, the videos load up much faster than with the TVLive.  We had tried the chromecast as well, but since it's not a stand-alone device, we were just frustrated, not only with the interface, but with the performance.  One thing I miss from the TVLive is the ability to browse a network share, but since I put a plex server on my network server, this has become a non-issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "nelmstr"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use...highly recommend!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sherry L Miller"}]
