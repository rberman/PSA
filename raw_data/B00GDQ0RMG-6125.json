I decided to try the Fire TV Stick because (1) it also had all of the amazon prime streaming and (2) the pre-order sale put this under $20.  Thus far I'm pretty happy with it.  The interface is pretty fast and I've had minimal issues streaming content.  Having played around with the chromecast thingy, I think I like this more since it has a remote and can work standalone.  The only thing I see lacking at this point is a good app of iOS (which is supposedly in the works).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Chris Covel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far so good.

I found the setup to be easy and the intro video very helpful.  Picture quality is great.  It did require an immediate update when I plug it in on the 20th November.  If you do get one of these, be aware that you need to use their micro usb cable and power adapter for it to work properly.  That is fine, but I wish the micro usb cable was longer. (The reason why I am giving it 4 stars). Be aware of that when you are setting the fire stick up.  If you are looking for an inexpensive way to use video streaming to your TV, this is a very good option, however, I would think the Fire TV or Apple TV is better if you want to spend a little more money.I would recommend this device or Fire TV to anyone who does not have an iPhone or iPad.  The apple users may want to go to Apple TV due to the airplay capabilities.  Apple users can actually use there phone or iPad to play content from Amazon Video on their Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Joe Long"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I think this is a very cool product. Howeve,r there is very little new programming available that doesn't have a fee involved. I thought I would have more access to free programming or at least discount priced programming from some of the affiliated companies/ channels/ links. Still, it's a pretty versatile tool. Admittedly, I am new to this sort of thing. Maybe a little more time and I'll feel better about it.Either way, I'm only out 20 bucks!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "bryan stewart"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Received Fire TV Stick from Amazon on time and it was very easy to setup.

Setup was a breeze, although I did have to reposition it to get the wireless connection to my router. After that it performed a software update before allowing me to connect. It did know that this stick was tied to me, would have been nice for me to setup all of my apps/accounts via my Amazon profile ahead of time.

The Stick is capable of working with Amazon prime, Netflix, Pandora and many other services. Plus games, music, photos and more. I plugged mine into my A/V receiver but it should work the same plugged into your TV. It gets its power from a USB port on the side of the stick. If your equipment has a USB port the power can come from that. But it seems to need a little more power than a standard USB. It comes with a small wall power plug to USB adapter. When I plugged it into my A/V receiver's USB it did work but warned me it would work better with the included power adapter. It also failed to do an update when power came from the A/V receiver. Although everything else seemed to work ok. After using the included wall power adapter the update went fine.The menu system gives Amazon preference which is not surprising. The menu is laid out along the left side of the screen. Movies, music, watch list, new releases, etc. these are all from Amazon. There is also a home choice. From Home you access Netflix, Hulu Plus, Pandora,,etc.  So you could think of it as having Amazon services on the first tier of the menu and the other services on a second tier.The navigation controls are very responsive. I like the remote layout. It's very much like a Roku remote in size and layout. The big difference is there is no ok button. Instead it has a more conventional arrangement of a select button in the center of the navigational up, down, left , and right buttons. Video and sound quality are very good.I have not had any video stuttering or any other artifact showed up. One feature I did like was adjusting the screen to your monitor. When I first used it, it displayed 4 symbols at the edge of the display, at the top, bottom, left, and right side of the screen. You can then adjust it so the picture is sized right for your monitor.As mentioned there is an android app. iOS coming soon they say. It turns your android device into a fully functional remote with voice control. You must turn on the androids Wi-Fi for it to work. It does everything the basic remote does plus adds voice search. The voice search works very well. The voice search always searches  Amazon. In other words if you're in Netflix browsing and you use voice search it takes you to the video but in Amazon video not Netflix. You can use voice search from anywhere but it always searches Amazon.Video playing features: If watching a series it will auto play the next show after a small wait. After watching a movie or at the end of a series it will recommend similar movies/series.So far I've had it freeze up while navigating the menus a few times. This happened while quickly pressing the nav buttons. I've had no problems while watching videos. I had to unplug the power to reset it. As this is a brand new product I don't find this terribly concerning as many manufacturers seem to release products before their time and fix them with updates. So I assume this will get better with age. If not, then I recommend installing it so you can either get to the the Stick or the power plug easily making resetting easier.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Craig Youngman"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I tried this on 2 separate TVs with the USB plugged into the TV for power. Both times the device kept restarting without moving beyond the Fire TV logo. I haven't tried with the USB cord plugged into a power brick yet. My power strip is full so I was really hoping the USB power would be enough. This is the reason why I'm rating this at 2 stars. The process to get this working is not as smooth as I was hoping.Also, the port for the USB cord on the side of the stick is in an awkward position. If you have multiple HDMI ports next to each other, then the Fire Stick would need to be on the very right so that the USB cord does not interfere with other HDMI cords. They include an HDMI extender in the box, and I think it's there to help with this issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
