[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Chromecast is freaking AWESOME for $35!  I spent more on my LG 'Smart' TV and the Netflix/Hulu apps are rarely stable and constantly force me to re-sign back in.  Same goes for my Panasonic Blu-Ray surround sound (which sounds great otherwise).  This thing is far more stable, loads faster and overall has been much more used than the TV or Blu-Ray apps since I got it a few weeks ago.  Sure I'd like a few more applications to work on it (PLEX PLEASE!!!) but so far it's exceeded my expectations, ESPECIALLY FOR $35!!!  The only thing I don't like is Pandora doesn't do the screensaver thing that Google Play does (but that's not anything to do with the CC itself).If you have issues with your current hardware like me you'll absolutely love CC.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ZK"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Limited, causes disruptions in Wifi, had to remove its power to get home network working\u2026..I would not buy this again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jim Cromwell"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The Chromecast doesn't yet work with Chrome for Android which was one of my main use cases.

It worked ever since.. it works awesome.I personally don't have it plugged in my TV now, but in my sound system's hdmi port. works great and now I can enjoy the surround sound of Netflix etc.I just wish Google would release it in the Netherlands officially so more apps would be available.. now I'm stuck with Netflix, Google Play Music (works great also) and Youtube..Google please release Google Play Movies in the Netherlands... thank you and goodnight", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "chris"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very good, works like a charm! However, lack of apps made me give only 4 stars. Definitely needs more support from apps.
