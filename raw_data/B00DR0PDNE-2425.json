[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I got this to \"cast\" netflix from a tablet or a pc to my tv.It was supposed to come with a couple of free months of Netflix - and DIDN'T. I'm a little annoyed about that. The promotion ended just as I placed my order, I guess.It works flawlessly with casting nexflix and youtube from my older ipad and android phone to my tv. It makes my XP box and my chrome box work a little harder. Runs beautifully in the background on my iPad.I was really hoping it would work with more things- but I guess they are still developing applications for more features. I'm looking forward to that.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joe"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I paid for it but never received it.  I now understand that if you buy something that is shown on amazon you are not always buying it from amazon. Sometimes It comes from a third party. AMAZON DOES NOT STAND BEHIND IT they just take a % of it. IF the turd party goes belly up and does not send you the product AMAZON STILL TAKES YOUR MONEY. So for your movies and all your entertainment needs go to NETFLIX. That's what I did. At least you get what you pay for. I'm only $30 dollars but that will  be the last of what they get from me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Arch E Vanbelle"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I purchased this for my husband for Christmas and we were surprised at how easy it is to set up.  We have had no problems and I only have two concerns:1 - We have a 48\" TV that is mounted to a wall in an alcove.  The chromecast sticks out enough that we have to be very careful if we turn the TV that we don't bend the chromecast device on the side of the alcove.2 - This isn't really a concern with the chromecast, but I find it ironic that I purchased this item on Amazon, but I can't use it to stream Amazon Prime.  We ended up buying a Netflix subscription so that we would have SOMETHING to watch with it, but I find the programming much better on Amazon Prime and would love to be able to watch that on our TV instead of on our iPad.All in all, I'm glad we bought this--given the price, it is probably the best device out there.  I just wish I could watch Amazon Prime with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "WestMetroMommy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player 's very Good!!!It is very good, I very like it, thank you,have a good day", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "roc595"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "No reason to regurgitate the list of what this device can do.

As long as the Youtube videos are HD, the play quality on a large screen will be fine. If the primary video is of poor quality, the display will be poor (as expected).
