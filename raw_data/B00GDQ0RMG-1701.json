I love them both. After just setting it up and logging into Netflix to watch a movie, I can't tell the difference between the two devices. I'm not sure why anyone would by the $100 fire TV when this less expensive option does it all.The only thing I can tell for sure is loading time seems to be slightly longer. Is that my internet tonight? Is that Netflix's limited bandwidth on a high volume time? Or is it the device quality itself?
