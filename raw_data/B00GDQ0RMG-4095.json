[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "The device itself is friendly with an easy to navigate interface. What is disappointing is the amount of Apps available for Fire TV.  If Amazon and the major TV networks can't reach an agreement to include their Apps, I don't believe this technology will last long.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire Stick has performed as advertised.

The only difficulty was getting it from behind some wires so that it could get a clear signal.  Since then works well.

We have binged watch a huge variety of shows and makes Prime a much better value.

Ease of use and functionality is that of apple quality, with the added benefits of your prime accounts.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric Neusiis"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very easy to install.  I have amazon prime and it is loaded with all the amazon prime benefits of movie and music selection, even is synced with music that I recently downloaded.  My only disappointment is that hulu and other apps like that such as netflicks are a little trickier to find and use.  Well worth purchasing and plugging into your tv to watch amazon prime movies, much easier than connecting laptop to tv with monster cable to watch movies on large screen tv...would recommend", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JMH"}]
