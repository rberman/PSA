Locked up the first time I used it to where I needed to pull the power. I watched a movie and after 2hours out of 2.5 the device just stopped playing back saying it had connection issues blaming the internet connection ( I think the device was overheating), However I was able to use my phone and laptop to continue to play the movie on the same connection. overall it needs software help, but for the price I paid it is alright as a beta product.
