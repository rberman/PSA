[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "You can already get Amazon Prime on other devices.  Devices that cost less.This is no different than Roku, Netgear's device, Vizio, Sony's devices, etc, etc.  All of them lock you down to their own service.  You want something they don't have... to bad, you can't go to play store and get it.  They are all doing this crap, and you are always locked down to what they offer you.  Oh, and the remote is crap... the cpu not that great.  Really, it's just a locked down rebranded solution that others already offer.  Hell, with the crappy game controller, this looks like an Ouya.Go buy a generic Android TV device.  Amazon sells them.  One that has a better remote, a keyboard for example.Want to play good games, ones that support the default android multi-touch?  Then go get that.  One that allows you to chose the games you want from play store, not one where they chose what you should have.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "7/30", "author": "BackAssward \"BackAssward\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very east  to install, immediately watched a movie.

I have not owned a Roku or Apple TV so am not an expert. It is easy to set up, really fast and I love that it is a controller (in theory as I haven\u2019t received mine yet. The only reason I didn\u2019t give 5 stars is that I wish the navigation was a bit better. I don\u2019t mean the way the remote works (it is excellent with Bluetooth connection, I\u2019m not fighting the normal IR fight) but the navigation of content. The Voice Search is great (which helps) but I wish it had the ability to filter solely by Amazon Prime movies and content. It does have what\u2019s new on Prime, but I wish I could filter by all Prime, or all games or possibly a customizable Launchpad like on the Dolphin Browser for all the Android users out there.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Haven't been able to stream anything from Netflix or YouTube without the app crashing or the video stuck loading forever.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "22/31", "author": "Sean Tanimoto"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I had a Roku 2 for some time and Fire TV blows it out of the water in performance. The picture and sound quality are superb. The voice command is effortless. The only gripe I have is that the voice command only works with Amazon content. I primarily use Netflix for streaming and although the netflix app works even better than Roku and the programing of Fire is a pleasure to use, I would rate Fire TV with five stars if the voice command was available to other apps. In terms of hardware and programming, this box is definitely worth a look.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Russell Olsen"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Every unit in the world has HBO GO but this one!!

After a few calls to customer support they said to use an Ethernet cable from the wireless router to the box.  That did the trick and it downloaded the updates and began to receive the wireless signal.  I could not be happier with the Fire TV.  The picture and sound are great and the microphone feature works very well. The selection of movies and shows is awesome and this unit has everything I will ever need and it adds more value to my Prime membership.

However, the Fire TV interface is far superior in terms of its ease of use, speed, and overall functionality. It makes my \"smart\" TV look downright dumb. For example:- Multitasking: On my Fire TV I can play music (Pandora, TuneIn, etc.) and then do other things with my Fire TV (like play a game) with the music still playing in the background. (My Samsung TV does not multi-task and will stop playing music as soon as I leave the music app.)- I can quickly pause/start/skip music via the Fire TV remote or game controller without having to navigate back to the music app.- The Fire TV's \"Recent\" apps section allows me to quickly start my favorite apps. For instance, I can get to Netflix with only a couple clicks of the remote, while my Samsung TV always makes me start from the Home screen and navigate to the Apps screen and then finally to the Netflix icon -- a minimum of 6 clicks away.- On top of that, apps open on the Fire TV almost instantaneously. Apps on my Samsung TV always take several seconds to load.- The apps and games available on Fire TV are far superior to anything on the Samsung TV.It's too late to return my \"smart\" TV for a refund, so I'll just continue to use it as a dumb monitor for my Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Seattle Steve"}]
