Just make sure not to cover it and leave room for ventilation.Overall: This device is affordable and adds a whole new ease of entertainment viewing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Alexander"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We have Chromecast for each of the TVs in my house and we love it!
