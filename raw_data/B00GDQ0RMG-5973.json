I do wish it would work with Serviio for streaming videos from my PC but Plex gets the job done.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Timothy L Lyssy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My FireTV stick arrived earlier than advertised, and it's bumped my power-hungry PS3 for streaming duties.Installation was simple: My TV has a USB port (an LG 50PJ550, it claims the port is for service diagnostics only, but it works) so I didn't need to use the included adapter.  The power adapter itself is a nice bonus, it's Kindle Fire-compatible (standard USB micro B cable) so I got a free tablet charger out of the deal.  In setting up my wifi I found it supports 802.11ac, so my fancy new router is getting put to use.  Nice!As for apps, Amazon Instant Video / Prime content is given center stage, but Netflix/Hulu/etc. are all easily accessible.  I wouldn't shy away from this if you're not a Prime customer.  The Amazon Instant Video app is more usable than the PS3's, and the Netflix app is pretty much identical as well.Video looks good, I couldn't tell any difference to my PS3's output aside from a bit of jitter/lag for the first few seconds the first time I watch a series or movie.My only concern is that the remote feels a bit insubstantial - all of the weight is at the bottom, so it has a bit of a hollow feeling in your hand.  Not a huge concern, but worth mentioning. You can use your phone a la Chromecast if the remote isn't your thing.Also, Amazon has finally figured out product packaging.  It's really pretty, if that matters to you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gidget"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "AWESOME! Answer to my streaming needs.

All our main machines (xbox, ps3, wii) are in the living room with the BIG tv. We didn't want to move any of those to the bedroom but wanted a cheap and easy not to mention small solution for streaming to our non-smart LG tv in the bedroom. We wanted to it to stream Netflix AND Amazon so Chromecast was out.

I had woefully underused my Netflix subscription, as well as Showtime app, since I don't like watching on a tablet/laptop, and hooking a device up to the TV each time is a pain.  (Lazy, perhaps, but true.)  I'm not a big techie, but The Fire stick came synched to my Prime account, and was easy to get onto my home Wifi and linked to Netflix and Showtime.  I've already started a couple of new series, have greater access to movies, and more on-demand kids' content for my toddler.  And with HBO GO coming in early 2015, it will only get better.
