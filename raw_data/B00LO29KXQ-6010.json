My old Roku doesn't have You Tube and is so sluggish. The Fire stick is great for me as I can stream Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus, You Tube, Netflix,.. with one device. The first thing you do when you get this device is the software update and then it's fine. Great product, kudos to Amazon for coming with a great product. PS. I do have chromecast, but I am using fire stick more.. hope more channels/Apps come to Fire Stick in the future", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Raj"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "getting \"unable to update your fire tv stick\" error repeatedly.  Initial update took forever and then the stick kept crashing.  Chromecast is much easier to use and much more reliable.  I'm returning this product and cancelling my preorder to the echo.

Got it today and love it. If you're a Prime member, and/or have a Fire tablet, you shouldn't hesitate to get this.I had been watching Prime and Netflix with my PS3 but won't any more.The Fire Stick does so much more than just let you watch videos. Your cloud photos and videos are instantly accessible on your TV as well as your music and Prime playlists.The only negatives I can see so far is that there's no off switch, only sleep, and it needs to be plugged in.Oh, and the Prime radio stations haven't made it onto the fire tv yet. Hopefully they'll add those in soon.Everything I've started with it, music, videos, prime movies, etc. has started quickly and played back perfectly.The Fire TV remote app is pretty great too. The voice search was able to decipher everything I said on the first try. La Dolce Vita, Alice in Wonderland, Transparent, etc.Amazon did a great job with this one!I've been using mine all day now and haven't had any problems with the wifi dropping.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "stacey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This item worked great.
