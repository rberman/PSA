The veredict: not very practical. Setting it up in a different wifi is too complicated (need a factory reset), had wifi signal problems where other devices worked ok, and the lack of a remote makes an unviable solution to give it to my parents.

Understand that it doesn't mirror everything on the laptop. I didn't realize that. But it does what it says it does, and it's easy to use and set up. Multiple iPhones can connect to it. I never need to reset it. It's cool. Worth the minor investment. If you have Netflix on your phone, you can travel with this tiny thing and use it anywhere.
