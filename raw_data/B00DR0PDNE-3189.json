[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I've heard it works great for Netflix and a few other services, but I bought it in order to stream from Chrome on my laptop. In that aspect this is terrible.* The video loses sync with the audio occasionally* The video pauses for several frames at times* The audio is jittery at timesWhen I switch back to playing from my laptop, everything is great again. I then switch back to Chromecast, and it's broken.Unless google fixes this with an update, I would say don't buy if you want to stream tabs from your browser.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Rahul S"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Not much apps on the device.

We already have a tv with netflix and hulu as an option. We also have a computer and a ps3 hooked up.  Yet this is my go to for netflix and hulu. Why, it is so much easier to use the apps on my ipad or galaxy s3 to find and play what i want to watch. Plus, they just keep adding to this. HBO is now available. I am just waiting for amazon to allow its video app to work with this great little device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "aaron williams"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Since I've chosen to never buy cable TV (I have rabbit ears) this device is basically perfect. I suppose my complaint would be that streaming local media can be challenging, and I've had to restart it a few times which also requires new setup. Setup itself was very easy for me.

But for this low price and simplicity as well as portability (bring it anywhere), You get almost seamless streaming that for me has worked perfect every time. I see a video on YouTube on my phone that I want to see better, share with others, etc. I turn TV on and simply start the video on my phone or tablet and press the streaming icon on that device. It is now playing flicker free on my TV. Of course you must have an HDMI port on the TV as well as a USB port (for power) or a wall socket avail for the power cord if no USB (Everything you need comes with unit).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "George Madden"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I will give it 5 stars when I'm able to use more apps with it.
