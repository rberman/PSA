However when streaming Netflix  or prime videos the audio quite often lags behind the video.

For me, this was really 0 stars, but I give it 2 for potential.I pre-ordered the Fire TV Stick for cheap.  I've owned 9 dedicated media players (in addition to dvd and blu-ray players that also handle some streaming).  Using the Fire TV Stick, I was never able to stream more than 20 minutes of a movie from Netflix, Amazon, or local media via XBMC.  The Fire TV Stick would get crazy hot and then show a wifi error: \"Connected with Problems\".  I would turn it off, let it cool down for an hour, and then try again.  I tried connecting to two different wifi routers (2.4Ghz and 5Ghz).  Same issue.  In the end, I returned the stick because I just couldn't make it work.I was plugging the Stick into an HDMI switch (via the dongle) and not directly in the TV.  I'm not sure if that could have caused the issue.As a comparison, I give the full Fire TV a 5 star review.  The full Fire TV adds ethernet (no wifi issues), optical out (my receiver doesn't handle HDMI), and supports IR (with a USB IR receiver).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "M.

Already preloaded with my prime, and the interface is intuitive.  Downloaded a couple of free games to play with my 4 year old, and Netflix account was easy to setup.  There's a ton of free stuff on Prime, and between that and Netflix, I'm good for about 15 years worth of stuff to watch.  Now I'm thinking about getting the more expensive Fire TV for the living room, and keeping the stick in the bedroom.
