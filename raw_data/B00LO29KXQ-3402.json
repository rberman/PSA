I've used it at home and taken it with me when traveling. I adore my Fire TV Stick. I have two monitors on my PC, but I decided to plug my Fire Stick into my extra monitor. I have Prime and have purchased some shows and movies through Amazon in the past and now I've got everything all together and I can take it anywhere and plug it in. I've run into issues where it's playing then boom, says I'm \"connected with problems,\" but that's usually when I know I'm in a room of the house that is barely in range of WiFi. Other than that, I love how it starts right where I left off if I have to pause and walk away for a while. I only have one small complaint - so I headed to Dallas and took my Fire TV Stick with me because the room I stay in has a TV but no cable/dish. But, I realized once there, I forgot the remote. Had I thought before I left, I could have downloaded the Fire TV remote app and voila. Unfortunately, I hadn't thought about that aspect, so I had a Fire TV Stick, but no way to connect to the WiFi without a remote, so I had to order another remote and rush delivery in order to use it while I was away. It would be nice if you could access it using the app even if you hadn't synced it before. I would think I could log into the app and pick my Fire TV Stick and boom, it knows - but that's not how it works... Without a remote, it's useless. So now, I have two remotes AND the remote app so no matter where I go, I should be all set.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TMB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.

I had a Roku stick and it would have trouble staying connected to wifi.  The Fire TV Stick stays connected with strong signal.  It's user interface is also much quicker than the Roku.  The screen responds to the remote control instantly unlike the Roku which had a slight but detectable lag.  This also comes with the HDMI extension cable.  I have 3 TVs and all require the use of an extension cable due to the placement of the HDMI ports.  I would imagine I'm not alone in this and Roku's choice to not include one is puzzling.  So in summary, as compared to the Roku, it's $10 cheaper, performs better, and includes everything you need in the box.  There's no downside...get this!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MJP"}]
