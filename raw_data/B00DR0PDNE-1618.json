[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I purchased this device in the hopes that I would be able to enjoy media on a personal TV in college; unfortunately, I was majorly let down. This device is not compatible with the internet security systems for my (and, it seems, many other school's) college and it was a waste of time. To get this thing to work requires more work and money than it's worth, and I'd rather just buy a device that supports WPA2 Enterprise internet. Sadly, I will be returning my Chromecast and looking for other options.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alison Bemis"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works with Netflix, HBO Go, You Tube and Pandora.  I can't use it with Chrome as casting from a mobile device is not supported.  The quality is just okay.  It's definitely not great, but I suppose for $35, it's not bad.  I probably should have spent a little more money and bought the Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

It was a little slow and sometimes paused to buffer when my tablet and the Chromecast where connected to my Xfinity wireless n router.  So I dug out my old wireless g access point, connected it to the network and put it next to the TV and connected my tablet and the Chromecast to it. It seems to work fine now so it might have been the Xfinity router and not the Chromcast that was the problem.  Who knows it works now so all is well that ends well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mbs"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "We have two, and we enjoy them so far.
