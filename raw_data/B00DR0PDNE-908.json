[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Disappointing \u00a1!!!!!!!!!!!!! Works with very little.  Yes I streamed that stupid interview movie from YouTube.  Thought that was cool next tried streaming amazon prime instant movies,  nothing but problems,  my computer laptop screen showed on TV but the area in middle of computer where amazon movie was playing would not sure up,  so tried my cell phone,  keep getting messages from Amazon about some stupid amazon app that I needed to download to stream movies from,  after lots of warning messages got it downloaded, guess what still did not work,  so 4 hours later got it to stream using a beta feature of an app on my cell labeled  chromecast.  Acted like a beta feature to do basically what miracast does,  which is what I should have bought instead,  finally got cell screen to show on TV,  movie streaming was choppy,  I was not impressed.

All I've kept hearing is that if your TV has an hdmi port then Chromecast is for you. That's just not true.Setup on my other television was a breeze. I've watched a few shows and videos and it's a great gadget to have.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "yoursmineoursfam"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install.
