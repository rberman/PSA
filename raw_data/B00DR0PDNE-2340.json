It is fantastic in how simple and effectively it works. There are only 2 things that hold this device back: One is my crummy internet connection and the other is the relatively limited number of apps that work with it. However, it has Netflix, Hulu+ and HBO GO, so the only ones I am really lacking are Amazon Instant Video and WatchESPN. However, I am sure that in the near future Chromcast support will be nearly ubiquitous.With Chromecast, I no longer need cables (or Cable). In its simplicity it is the best electronic device I have ever used.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Trey Williams \"Trey W.\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just make sure you have a good internet speed and take it anywhere...CONS...Google don\"t be an apple...get more apps that access files without chrome  browser.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "vicbush"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I bought this on kind of a whim, but am surprisingly pleased with it.  I can now stream video directly from my WD My Cloud drive to my television.  It was very easy to set up and get going.  I realize that some people have had issues with getting their personal files to stream to the TV, however I had no such difficulties.  I run the video through my Zeki (cheap) Android tablet, using the AVIA software.  There is a minimal charge to enable the Chromecast feature in AVIA but it is really inexpensive and works well.There are only 2 issues that kept me from giving it 5 stars.1.  Avia does not currently support streaming AVI files.  This is possibly a licensing issue of some sort.  Hopefully this is something that will be corrected in the future.2.  If you have a slow WIFI/Internet Connection, the playback could be choppy.  Strangely enough, my cheap Zeki tablet streams flawlessly, while my Dell Laptop does not do so well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kenneth V.

I use the chromecast to play movies, netflix, and youtube. I love the fact that I can stream the videos while still using my phone. It occasionally buffers but that may be due to my wifi. Overall it is an excellent buy for those who wish to stream media wihtout using a game console or another expensive option.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Khiry Sutton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely loved this product.

So I ordered it went to hook up and come to find out it does not WORK.SO IF YOU HAVE A KINDLE HD 7\" 2013 DO NOT BUY THIS DEVISE.Now on a good note, returning the item so far has been easy enough. I followed the instructions for returning products. Now I'm waiting on UPS to come pick it up from me so it can be returned. Amazon instantly gave me credit .
