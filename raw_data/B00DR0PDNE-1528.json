[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my chromecast.  Since I travel a lot, it's way more convenient than an AppleTV or a Roku due to it's small size.  It's about the size of a large thumb drive.I watch a lot of YouTube videos on it.The app and connection on iPhone is a bit quirky, but you get used to it.  It won't directly connect to a network that requires you to go to a web page and agree to terms to activate your connection.  So I bridge through my laptop.  This way, I also don't have to reconfigure it for a new wifi hot spot every time I change locations.Obviously it requires a certain amount of bandwidth to function properly.  But all things said, you won't beat the value.Grab one of these and you wont be disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeff C"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really enjoy using the Chromecast.
