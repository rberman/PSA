[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "It gets the job done, but I did experience a few things that were less than satisfactory. The first, most annoying issue that I have with it, is the lack of an on/off button on the remote. It's annoying to leave it in idle mode all of the time, especially when your TV had Regza mode and automatically switches to HDMI input if it detects a device that is on.The second issue I had, is that sometimes there is a lag when the pause button is pressed, and on one occasion, it continually paused and played itself without me pressing any buttons at all. I had to unplug it to get it back in track.Third, Amazon advertises the ability to mirror or cast your tablet/phone, but that isn't actually possible without third party applications. I have learned now that Amazon devices can cast without third party applications.All around, I'm dissapointed. But, it does what I need it for. The menu could use some work, and the parental features aren't the greatest.The most annoying thing is that all if the advertisements show the device without a power cord, buy it does require external power. That was really deceptive on Amazon's part, to show it in televisions without the power cord.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Josh"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing.

No free time for my kids which is why I bought it... Terrible idea Amazon to leave this feature out, which set you apart, from this device. Now I have a device that I cannot use. I will most likely be sending it back. Mighty greedy of you to expect people who care about their kids to shell out $99 when you could have added it to you $39 option. Now I will be canceling the free time plan as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Robert"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "uses too much bandwidth.  We have to purchase each episode.

Great quality, easy setup, and love the easy access to Prime Instant Video and Netflix.  Also really love the Android app that I downloaded for free, which turns all of our phones into fully functional remotes including voice search.  Initially I was disappointed that the remote included with the stick doesn't include Voice Search (the remote that ships with Fire TV does), but once I downloaded the app I got voice search for free so no longer care about not having a physical Voice Search remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kurt"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I purchased for quicker service on my Netflix acct but it slow and throws me out of Netflix I checked my network and my wifi is connected and very good so its not my wifi? and I try use all the other free apps and you have to pay for most of all movies I would like it to work with my Netflix as that's the only app I like and prefer", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ANGIE"}]
