[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "The Firestick connected Amazon TV with my second Television set, no trouble at all.  However, there was no voice command function for the second TV.  A very tedious process requiring on screen spelling of instructions for second TV functions is required.  I recommend buying an additional Amazon Fire TV box for each additional TV so voice command is available at each TV or you'll go crazy selecting additional TV functions using on screen spelling for functions.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Henry Stanley"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am very happy with my family to watch an limited edition i remedy for everyone", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "freweyni gebrehiwet"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tony Mundy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's good but you have to pay for most of the tv show I love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "betty scott"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Everything has a cost to watch.
