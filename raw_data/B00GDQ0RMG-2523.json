I was tired of watching movies on my computer so I read all the reviews on this and the price was right so I ordered it.It came very fast and was easy to set up.Just do not forget you will need a power outlet on it as it does not show the cord.Wonderful product and I would recommend this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sandra Cieklinski"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Love the features.  My only concern that is that alot of times I see the error \"lost connection\" even though my signal says very strong.  I am not sure if I am going to return it or not. I have alot of music stored on the anazon cloud so that was my main reason that I purchased it.  If I can thus probkem fixed, I will bump up my stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "swampbuggy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "the fire stick is a great device with a great value. Amazon Prime was a great boost for me with this device it had a few movies that I liked but could not find on Hulu and Netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Devon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I will begin by saying that when I ordered the Fire TV Stick I already owned the Fire TV box.  The Fire TV box is in the living room.  There have been occasions when I wanted to watch TV before going to bed.  That was solved by ordering the Fire TV Stick.  I love it!  Amazon makes everything so easy for you with the installation and even better, as a Prime member it was registered to me when it arrived.  It does everything the Fire TV box does except the remote for the Fire TV Stick does not do voice commands.  I did not find that a problem since I can use the voice command option with the box in the living room.  If you want to add this to a child's room there is an option to control programming too. The operation for either Fire TV products is easy and really intuitive.  The only regret that I have is that I wish I would have ordered it sooner.  Highly recommended.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alice M.
