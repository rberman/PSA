I bought more when they were on sale for 24.99 still a great deal. They are normally $39 which I think is still a decent price. It compares well with the Chromecast which I also use. The addition of the remote and subtraction of Google services is worth the price premium over the Chromecast.The two mains reasons I bought the Fire TV were for the remote control and for the Prime Video capability. They are the two main things missing from the Chromecast which I also use and own. I use the Fire TV mainly for Netflix and Plex which behave much better on the Fire TV Stick than with the Chromecast. The Fire Stick is much quicker at loading, Fast Forward/Rewind, and seeking.PRO: Has a remote control. Works with Prime Video. Faster CPU and more storage than Chromecast.CON: The main issue is the sound glitching problem that appears to be widespread. It seems there is an issue with the power adapter, really surprising that the product shipped like this.A couple minor issues are occasional freezing and restarts. Another minor but nagging issue was getting the remote batter door open was difficult. I would not give this to someone who might be old/young or have hand mobility issues without putting the batteries in for them.It also does not work with Google Play Music (or apps/services to the best of my knowledge). I also prefer the Chromecast for Youtube as it seems to work more smoothly.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gavin H."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was simple to set up & took no time at all to start using.

Did it manually and it now works ok, though not flawlessly (occasional disconnects) - the Stick and HDX 7 (Fire OS 4.5.2) are less than ten feet apart.

Unfortunately it has such a slow connection to my Apple Airport Extreme.  My just did speedtest.net and had 13x13 speed.  My samsung phone, iphone, ipad, and IMAC all connect great and run well.  For some reason my Fire TV Stick has such a slow connection that any show pauses for 20 seconds to load the next 10 seconds.
