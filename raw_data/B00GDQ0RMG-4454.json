It isn't so overly technical that they can't understand it and all the apps work as advertised with minimal set up required.Pros:- small size, so fits unobtrusively on the side of the tv (usually)- plethora of apps- fast, crisp video playback with little lag- easy to set up and useCons:- will not work without packaged AC adapter- AC adapter plug is in a weird place that causes the cord to stick out from the side of the tv (not a huge problem but can be unsightly)- remote can be a bit awkward at times (the universal circle input can be hard to use)- battery cover on the remote is all but impossible to get off amking changing batteries a chore", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great deal love the little thing", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dean Waters"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Good product.
