Would rate 5 stars BUT...Had to reboot (power cycle) after a few days because of wifi problems. Several other wifi devices on my network were fine but the Fire Stick said \"connected to network with problems\".  No option to reconnect either. Also,  screen casting from my Nexus 5 (lollipop) is iffy at best. Lots of pops and clicks and eventually the connection is dropped.

I have to say I like them for different reasons. For playing amazon prime content this works great! Other programs, such as Netflix, work just fine! The youtube app was the same as on the Roku which is sluggish and not worth using the space with.For the movies they start more instantaneously than any other platform I've seen. Granted I do not own an Amazon Fire which is probably faster. The reason I gave this 4 stars is only because the youtube app is so bad that if I want youtube I use my phone, computer, or move the chromecast back into the room.Other than that it's a great device and I love the remote! It works like a charm.Lastly thank you Amazon for using a QWERTY keyboard in the software. it is so much faster than those that only use an alphabetical list.!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "cortescurtis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've only been using it for a few days but it seems so much more responsive than my Roku.

Also had to go online to figure out how to put in the batteries in the remote. There is no clear indication on how to unlatch the back cover and most users are afraid that they would break the remote with too much pulling/pushing.When you turn the tv off while watching anything from amazon, and then restart, and change the tv input source to normal cable, the fire would automatically switch to its own input source after maybe a minute. Annoying as heck.The smallish remote has keys that appear too stiff, and the onsceen search functionality takes some getting used to.Screen would routinley go black and the stick will routinely restart/reboot in the middle of playback- not very frequently but often enough to be annoying.Once a video is launched, then it plays smoothly.Can't recommend at $40 but at half the price, during thanksgiving etc, it might be just a barely ok accessory.Just has too many pieces in motion, unlike say the chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The remote is iffy...

We played Tetris and a few other free games with the little remote and it worked fine. Prime movies and shows also play beautifully.
