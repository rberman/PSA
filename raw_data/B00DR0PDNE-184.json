It has very limited capability and the \"live\" or \"mirrored\" streaming from the PC, tablet, etc to the tv isn't the greatest, it freezes quite a bit. I don't have this issue with other products. This also has VERY LIMITED apps. Just check it out before you buy it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gerald F. Juneau"}]
