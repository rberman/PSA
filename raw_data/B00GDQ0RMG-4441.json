Then came the extremely busy and annoying menu system, this device is little more than a gateway into Amazon offerings.  Lots and lots of repetitive icons all over the place.  There is an issue with audio popping on many of the streaming apps.  I do not have Prime so I cannot comment on the audio quality but I assume it will pop as well.  Overall I am not happy with this device and may return it.  I have put in an order for a Roku and if I do not have any audio issues, the Fire TV Stick is going back to Amazon.  Also, the remote feels extremely cheap.EDIT:  Removed the Firestick extension cable and moved the device to another TV.  The sound issue went away, not sure if it was the cable or the monitor it was plugged into originally.  I have never had a problem with that monitor with any other HDMI connected to it.EDIT 2:  Comparing this to the Roku stick, I like the Roku better only because their interface is much cleaner.  The Fire stick is much faster than the Roku, but the interface is horrible.  I also bought this for Plex, it is the first device I had to pay for the Plex app, it also has the worst looking Plex app.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MattyD"}]
