You can mirror the entire screen for some devices such as the HTC M7, Nexus 5, Nexus 7 2013, Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and LG G Pro and a few others which I have not tested. For other devices you'll only be able to cast the compatible apps such as YouTube, Netfix and so on. You can even cast whatever you are doing on Google Chrome from your laptop.
