Good product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Ordered under the $19 deal Amazon had going and mine arrived over the weekend.  So far, I love this thing!  Easy navigation, access to most content you'd want to stream, fun games, good parental controls.  I'd give it 5 stars except I found the YouTube app to be extremely low quality and there's no HBO Go.  I'd like to see more cable network streaming apps available.  Also, more games.  Overall, pretty cool and well worth the money.  So far, I like it better than Chromecast and Roku.  Great product!  I'll be picking up another one if I see it go on sale again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

Streaming Amazon or Netflix through my TV or Blu-ray player always seem to buffer quite a bit with my Internet connection which is not the fastest. I have watched several movies since receiving fire TV stick and it has not buffered at all, picture is very clear and the sound is awesome through my sound bar! I use my phone as a remote and it works flawlessly. Set up was a breeze and I was up and running within 10 minutes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "KIBILL"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great does exactly what I expected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fast setup  connected to network with no problems wish there were more apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "tomb1013"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Faster than my apple tv, great buy specialy if you have Prime.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gleasca"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "A good start; now make it better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gary Thomas"}]
