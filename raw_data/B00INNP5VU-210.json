I have had a hard time with Comcast and I got this. Love that I can stream channels on this.  Now that Sling TV is out, I can watch regular TV after work with a lot of great channels.  The channels are getting better.  Wish I could get HBO or Showtime.  You have to have cable or dish service already in order to utilize those channels through the ROKU.  That's kind of the point - this is our new service.  I am sure they will have a solution soon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shannon"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Apple TV is better.
