[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "This is the first device of this type that I own, but I've wanted one, so I'd been researching them for for quite a while. Set up was quick and easy and it seems to work well for me.The only problem that I have is that after a while, things just won't play. At first, I thought my internet had slowed down, but when I checked the stick, it was very warm. This happens even when it's in sleep and not being used -- simply from being plugged into the power source. If I unplug it from the power source, it'll cool off and then work great again.  Some people have complained about streaming freezing up even though it worked fine previously, so perhaps unplugging it could solve this problem for some others. I plugged it into my TV's USB port, but that didn't solve the overheating problem.Overall, I really like this type of device and would have considered purchasing Fire TV for another room. However, now I'm hesitant because I don't know if it has the same problem, so I'm going to look into getting a Roku; lower specs but I haven't heard any complaints about performance because of it.If it weren't for the overheating problem freezing it up, I'd rate it 5 stars. It's not worth the $39.00 price tag until they address the issues.1/7/2015 editShortly after writing this review, my fire stick updated, which seems to have fixed the overheating issue. It's been a couple of weeks now, and still no more problems with that. Programs will still freeze up sometimes, but not as often, so it's not entirely related to overheating. It does seem to eat up more bandwidth than streaming from a computer. I've upgraded to 4 stars based on them fixing the issue so quickly and the device functioning so much better now that it isn't overheating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dawn"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Set up is easy. I like that it has a remote. However, it buffers all the time. My wifi with my wii and chrome cast do not have this same issue. I've tried to look at the troubleshoot guide, which says check internet connection.

Plus, it feels poorly made (very light). While it works fine, it isn't particularly fast.

They keep telling me to go change things in the properties, but you have to be able to finish the registration process to get to the properties.  When I try to complete registration, by logging into my amazon account, it tells me that there is a problem with my user name or password.

I was concerned that the upstairs TV might be out of the range of my router which is in the basement.  In fact I was able to get some very helpful suggestions on line to resolve the problem if that were the case.  As it turned out, this little device works great and connected to my Netgear 300N perfectly.  I already have Amazon prime and Netlex accounts and all I had to do was enter the password.  The buttons on the remote are easy to use.  Easy hook up.  This is a great device and I can see why there has been a delay in ordering them.  I noticed recently that even Best Buy was on back order.
