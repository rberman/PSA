When compared to my Roku 3 it is grossly lacking in available content.  In all fairness it has a nice compact size and offers some decent features, but is still too limited in terms of available channel content.As stated, I like its small size and portability as it seems like it'd be great for taking on trips.  However, in my book, it currently cannot compete well enough with my Roku 3 to consider it a viable replacement to it in my home theatre system setup.If you're an Amazon Prime content \"die-hard\" this might be your \"go-to\" streaming video device.  Otherwise, I'd do some more shopping around.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D. F. \"Spock\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am so glad I purchased this!

I prefer using Fire stick for Netflix and HBO GO apps (as opposed to my LG TV apps which are outdated). You can pick and choose which apps to download and install. So easy to stream the Amazon Prime movies & TV shows as well. Plus any pictures or videos on my Amazon cloud play through the stick.
