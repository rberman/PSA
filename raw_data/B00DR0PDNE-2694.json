Although it is good for the price, there are a few things I should note (Caveat Emptor).-It may cause internet connection problems since it is its own WiFi-It does not play ALL YouTube videos (most Music videos in fact will NOT play)-A lot of other types of Media you can stream through your computer... does not work on ChromeCast. (it is selective)-I still end up using my computer for the same things I thought I would use on ChromeCastOther then those issues, its great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mac"}]
