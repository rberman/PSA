I ordered a new network cable and HDMI cable to set it up with and it all arrived together. Since I ordered the item from my account, the setup already knew me and asked if i wanted to keep my account or change it. I kept it, I also discovered a few ways to use my Kindle Fire along with the TV and that was fun. I got this device for my daughter at Christmas so I already knew I would like it. I wanted an 'on demand' way to watch TV in my bedroom that has just a basic cable box.Only downsides I've found so far is the HBOtoGO does work on the Fire, but not with my cable company. (Comcast).and I would like to search for apps instead of going thru them all. Do I have only the options loaded? I was hoping to set up Acorn (British shows) but couldn't find it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "All Things Sookie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works Great !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LEE R.
