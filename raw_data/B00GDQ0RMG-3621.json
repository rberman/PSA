[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Absolutely wonderful.  This product works well.  I never have any stutter, it has made my \"dumb tv\" into a \"smart tv.\"  The apps are great.  I will give you a warning and state that if you have Directv or Comcast, alot of apps do not grant you access to their content.  Other than that, and the current lack of HBO Go, it performs admirably.I have attempted to sideload a few apps and a few Roms to play games from my Nintendo days.  It is really difficult to get the controller to operate properly on the sideloaded roms so I have since deleted them.  Overall I much prefer this fire stick over my Chromecast.  There isnt much to say that hasnt been written already.  It is a solid device with great support from Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Peter"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "it kept telling me my bandwidth wasn't enough.

The remote was a little difficult to open to put the batteries in.

The problem started by only downloading 25% of video then stopped.  This problem happened no matter what app I was using.  Finally, the apps quit loading all together.  My theory is the unit over heated because it is always on.  There is no off switch.  However, I am not an expert, so i could be wrong on why it quit working.If you buy this product you will risk product failure.  I had to send it back for a refund which Amazon did provide.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Danny Norwood"}]
