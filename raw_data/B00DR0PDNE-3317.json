[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "First of the good- the thing is tiny.  Compared to roku, apple tv, etc, this thing is super small.- it works.  It is very simple to operate and begin using- its portable.  Unlike other products, when you are done with it you can simply unplug it from your tv and go.- its power comes from usb.  This is perhaps the one of the best parts about this thing.  You do not have to plug this into the wall for it to work, but simply plug it into a usb port also on the back of most TV's.  the usb cable is included!- PRICE!  I mean come on, seriously... you can turn your tv into a smart tv for under 40 dollars!The not so good- There is only a very few apps that work with this so far: Youtube and Netflix.  (also it casts whatever is on your chrome browswer)Suggestions:- It would be great if they could expand the apps to also work with MLB, NHL gamecenter, and slingbox to name a few.In the end, you can not beat the price of this device.  Even with the limited app support I would recommend this product.  Once more apps are supported, this thing will amazing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MyReviewMyStory"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We are extremely glad that we bought this. No more hooking up the laptop to the T.V. Works well with Casting the tab from a PC.Only issue that we notice is that we cannot use Iphone or Ipad to cast the tab from Chrome.Would recommend this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Honest_Reviewer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy hookup to wireless network.  Can stream anything on your computer as long as computer is on the same wireless network.  Have to install the google cast add on to chrome browser.  However, if desktop is wired V. wireless, then streaming from the desktop might not work.  But who uses their desktop anyway, lol!  This device shines using your smartphone to control all aspects of viewing.  Cast youtube and netflix right from any smartphone.  The smartphone is your new remote control.  Doesn't run down the phone battery at all.  Once the video is cast, Google Chromecast player takes over and phone hibernates.  On old HDMI TV's you will need to plugin the Google Chromecast to an electrical outlet to get power (AC adapter included).  YouTube and Netflix both load up fast on a 10mb/s connection, contrary to other reports.  1080p looks as good as DirecTV.  Hopefully as time goes on, new apps will be added.  For $35 this is a home run!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Computer Guy \"Notebook guru\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "total disappointment! the idea is great Google but this device lacks reliability. the power adapter stopped  working in the first 2 mins of operation. I had to use one of my own adaptors. the software crashes randomly and quite often during playback. although \"ready to cast\" sometimes it is not discoverable and I need to reboot it. the video quality randomly drops from hd to low res with no apparent reason. and yes, I am an experienced electronics user. and no, it is not a fault of my tv or wifi network.  btw I use Google Nexus 7 FHD amongst other devices. sorry Google maybe a few s/w updates later or h/w versions later. I wanted my kids and wife to use such an idiot proof device but it is a waste of $35.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

Once there is more apps and support, it will be a much more powerful tool in home entertainment.Till it does, better to buy a Roku or other Internet Media Player.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.
