What I didn't realize was that you can't use a keyboard without some hacks.Pros- sideloading apps- Can watch xfinity and surf the internet but it's a pain.Cons- Amazon is the center of attention. Unless you buy a lot of content from them it's annoying.- Plex isn't free. I don't have to pay for it on roku. Didn't feel like purchasing the app since I already have it on tablets and free on Roku.- Working with sideloaded apps is cumbersome.- Busy home screen. I like the cleanness of roku better.Overall it's a nice product but is way too amazon focused. Amazon prime has a horrible selection as always and I don't buy video from them.If you're more of a Netflix or Hulu watcher and/or use plex, stick with Roku. The only thing I use my fire for is watching live channels on the  xfinity app.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.
