My favorite part is the search voice feature. awesome. Highly recommend this product. When using your phone to your tv, amazon fire uses the app, so if your watching something on you tube amazon fire you open the you tube app freeing up your phone for other things, apple tv just plays whats on your phone keeping your connected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Lee Castle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Extremely responsive and fluid.

I would watch favorite movies and TV shows on Netflix and had started watching Amazon videos since we now have Prime but this required being at the computer, and that's not preferred viewing of course. Now I can do that right on my TV in the living room on the couch! And I can watch favorite movies and TV shows while still working on my computer!  I like it that it's a one time charge and now we only have our regular prime and Netflix costs we already had. We don't have Hulu Plus and maybe one day we'll get that too. However, at this time we are quite satisfied. Also, we do enjoy our Sunday listening of Christian music via Pandora, which we can have on the TV and the sound is better than having it on one of the computers or phones which we often did in the past. I like the beautiful scenes we can watch during the music and during the pauses of the shows. We're busy with many things right now so we haven't looked  into some of the other features and apps, but so far what we are doing is sufficient and it's working very well, even though our wifi has been working poorly for a while now--that has not been an issue any more than it's been. Thank you for coming up with this product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Maxine Randall \"Speakable Gifts\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "On my Apple TV I am able to  stream to my big tv any of the music I have on my ipad and at the same time I see on the  tv screen pictures of the album or composer. The ability to do this seems to be lacking on Fire tv. I ordered 3 manuals from Amazon and none of them really cover this problem. For this reason I have given only 4 stars--although otherwise it should probably be 5 stars. I have Apple TV, roku, and fire tv--and except for this one thing, fire tv is clearly the best. Please let me know if Amazon is working on this music problem. Thank you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Harry L. Durant"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazon Fire TV is amazing.

It streams the entire Amazon Prime catalog.  The menu is not substantially different from android-based boxes, but it doesn't have any particular problems.  Setup was a breeze and I was watching Netflix and Prime immediately.  My Amazon cloud storage was immediately available, allowing me to view videos and photos stored there.  I really wish there was some way to access local media files as I have most of my videos and photos stored on a networked file server where I can access them from any device on my home network.  There is a paid version of Plex, I just haven't been willing to spend money to do something through the Fire that I can already do on my network for free.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kent L.
