Works great for watching videos and other apps, just disappointed (and should have realized) that we can't play Asphalt 8, Minion game and several others that the children love to play. Will most likely replace with Fire TV down the road and use this for portable movies etc. when traveling or visiting others.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
