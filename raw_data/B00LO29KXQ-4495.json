Anyway I have been a prime member for years (2010) and I love the amazon prime streaming services that they introduced last year included with prime.  Problem being that with my computer (~1yr old Dell XPS 13) seems to constantly skip or pause every few minutes which after 10 minutes becomes unbearable, hence, why I always check out Netflix first.  Bought this when they introduced (for 19.99) figured why not, and just trying this out this week.  This thing has been a lifesaver through my Bronchitis (Watching \u201cThe Americans\u201d good show).  The interface is simple and easy to use and the remote works flawlessly.  The skipping is non-existent with the stick and now I can enjoy the streaming services as they are intended to be enjoyed.
