I purchased two of these to supplement my Apple TV on a couple of other TVs in the house, but it falls a little short of what the advertise, in my opinion. Firstly it ONLY works with YouTube or Netflix, so forget streaming ANY content (photos, movies or anything else) directly from your Tablet or Smart Phone, currently ONLY YouTube & Netflix support Chromecast. I wish I had known that before I purchased.2. It stayed connected for a couple of days to my wifi. Now I cannot get it to reconnect to my wifi, to my tablets, nothing, no matter what I try.Update on Jan 4 2013. After a reboot of my Cable Modem and Cisco Router, I can now communicate to both Chromecast devices, so I am back up watching ONLY YouTube or Netflix via my iPad / Smartphone streamed to my TV, if I wish.Still would like the device to work with any content on my iPad / Smartphone. It currently seems very limited, but I will keep them for now hoping that they add more interfaces later.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.

Maybe it was my lack of expertise that caused this, if so, it will happen to most others also, I bet! I found very few sites that Chromcast, Netflix was good, but nothing from iTunes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James Turner"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this on Amazon before it was even advertised on T.V. and man do I love this product. I use it every single day and cannot wait until more apps are added. My T.V.s were bought back in 08 and do not have built-in Wi-Fi so this is the perfect fit for me. I like it so much that I purchased a second one. I like the fact that I can start a movie in one room, pause it and finish in another room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. E.
