Streams HD great without buffering.  Best bang for your buck considering it only cost 39.99.

It now works very well with no interruptions and is located 30 feet and through two walls to reach the wireless router. The other reviews solved my problems. The user interface is OK but I prefer the more complete ROKU interface.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Lisa Mac"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "fabulous, love the choices, easy to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kirk Polson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I just love the Amazon Fire TV Stick. The Fire TV Stick is truly awesome. I love how I can watch anything I purchase with through my Amazon Prime membership on any of my TVs in my home, no matter where I am at. I can also watch it on other portable formats as well. Great going Amazon. The Fire TV Stick is well worth every cent spent on this product. A great investment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jane"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like the fire stick it streams Prime Instant videos faster then my smart tv and with less buffering. Its great for Prime customers. I would give it 5 stars but the instruction are bad at worse, and there is no way to stream in quality less then HD. HD eats up the bandwidth. You have to keep a eye on the amount you use or you'll quickly go over your monthly allotment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mr mack \"the blues man\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far so good.
