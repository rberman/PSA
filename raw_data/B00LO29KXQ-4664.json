[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "If you are looking for a streaming device which freezes constantly, look for further! The Amazon Fire TV Stick is a delightfully frustrating device! It will require you to get up, reach behind your TV, and unplug the power cable to reboot the device at least twice before you give up and just watch Netflix or Amazon Instant Video on your Xbox. The controls are unresponsive, and navigating the menus will make you want to rip your own arms off.Seriously, this device is garbage. Don\u2019t buy it. The thing constantly disconnects from the internet, force closes apps, and the controller is garbage. Sometimes you click a button on the remote once and it recognizes it as one click. The next time it will recognize it as three. The next it won\u2019t recognize it at all. The next will be 30 clicks. The only way to turn it off or restart it is to unplug it, which is a huge pain if your TV is wall-mounted. The screencasting never works on any device. It does not natively support UMS or any of the similar protocols for streaming media from one device to another, either. I bought mine when it was only $19, and I still feel like I got ripped off.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jlawsonusmc"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I bought this in December didn't receive it for two weeks only received a two week trail period not very Happy with the limited free moviesThey want the money", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Marcia Robison"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Absolutely thrilled with this purchase.

This experience has not been. This product is garbage, dead on arrival... This product didn't work right out of the box. After troubleshooting w/ included questions such as does your TV have an HDMI input... Are you kidding me!?!?!? They are currently sending me a refurbished stick itself but not the cord... They will replace my brand new item with a refurbished one because \"statistics show I am less likely to have issues with it than a new one\"... I had issues with this due to the fact the problem could be in the power cord but they refused to simply replace the whole unit. Terrible experience and it isn't over yet.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works like Apple TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gloria Mahame"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I sent this back without ever getting it to work.
