[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "hopefully I will like this Fire TV stick better.  Disappointed after watching Boardwalk Empire, Season 1, that Season 2 would be a charge for each episode.

I never really warmed to streaming content until I was enticed by the price to try the Fire TV stick.  Prime membership means a LOT of content is available to me at no extra cost.Here's the downside, though.  My remotes have been multiplying like frenzied rabbits, so I want to go to a universal remote.  No dice! At present, no one seems to offer a universal that can drive both bluetooth and IR devices.so I can't incorporate Fire TV into the universal.  So what would be great is an IR relay accessory that receives IR codes and re-sends them as the corresponding bluetooth command; alternately, it could relay commands over the wireless link.The latter would probably work better because bluetooth can only pair,  It doesn't like threesomes.Besides, the Fire TV remote is too friggin' small for my massive mitts.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D.

But that's only happened twice since I purchased it (far less than my old roku did).It streams well and offers very good quality.  The only drawback is the search feature is a bit of a pain...  but it's no reason to not love this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Talgok"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great.If you have a Panasonic TV, and you get a weird flashing green screen after a few minutes of using this, TURN OFF Pixel Orbiter and it'll fix the green-ness.
