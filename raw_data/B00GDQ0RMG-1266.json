The setup was dead-dumb easy and everything worked right out of the box.  When we moved from the condo to a hotel later in the vacation, it was again easy to plug in the Fire TV Stick and immediately continue watching a Netflix series.  I can't imaging traveling without the Fire TV Stick on any future trips.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Kent L.

I can't totally do away with cable because you can't get everything with the stick, but I can use it on 2 of my 3 TVs and save some money.  Only downside is you have to plug it in and if you mount the TV on the wall, and your outlet is further down, there is no wayi to hide that big plug.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "John's Girl \"Mary\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Enjoying the movies and free channels.
