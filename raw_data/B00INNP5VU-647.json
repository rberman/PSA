I got an HDMI Swivel Adapter, plugged the stick in, attached the USB power supply (plugged into wall outlet, so it has power 100% of the time). The remote synced right away!  Did a little setup so I was getting the 1080P.  This thing was GREAT!  Then after about two weeks it started having problems, programs were interrupted, error messages on screen, audio out of sync with program and often the remote would not work.  At first I found that unplugging things and restarting fixed it for a while, but it got worse. Contacted Roku Technical Support (e-mail), explained this and was given some suggestions for updating the software, repositioning stick, etc.  Did all that and problem remained.  Decided it might be my router, so contacted router customer service, and updated firmware etc.  Streaming stick STILL didn\u2019t work.  After eight E-mails and two phone conversations with Roku, they suggested I send it back to Amazon for a replacement.Got the new one (Great customer Service Amazon!!) plugged it in, and I think it was even better than the first one\u2026for just over a week\u2026then the same things started happening to this one!  So I am going to send it back for a refund.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Dale M.

It had to be connected through an audio receiver in my case (perhaps an HDMI cable extension would have worked too). Otherwise the device works well and the graphic user interface is a bit easier to manage than some of the other internet TV devices that I have.

If you are seeking a smooth UI look elsewhere. If you like netflix the way it is displayed online and in other devices look elsewhere. This little device had me very excited until I booted it. I can see this being great for a guest bedroom/kids room or someone on a budget. If you have extra cash to spend on another device I would spend it. If not this is functional and has enough features to provide many happy hours of content.Pros:-Easy to setup-Cheap-Great for kids-Plenty of apps-Plex looks goodCons:-Netflix UI is clunky-Huge Adverts on the main screen-Recommendations that I do not want for apps-Difficult to find the content I wanted on Prime", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "online4ever"}]
