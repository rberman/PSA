Something seriously wrong as another buyer posted.After working for a few hours, suddenly whenever a button is pushed you MAY get your selection, OR more likely, the cursor will jump all over the screen - really, really frustrating and almost a deal breaker at this point, except that I don't want to return the unit I spent so much time setting up in the first place.I will contact Amazon and hopefully they will have a reasonable solution, as I don't see how this could be an isolated instance.I would seriously wait to buy this until the issues are cleared up.  Right now Google Chromecast is for sale at under $25.00 - it uses your phone as a remote - but it WORKS.I contacted Technical support today 12-11-14 - sadly, they knew more than anyone reading these reviews.  VERY frustrating situation that took over an hour to resolve, with one Tech actually telling me that the sticks on work with Samsung TV's!  Not!When I mentioned that I had given one as a Christmas Gift - I was tole \"no problem\" they can set it up and if it doesn't work we will exchange it - even though they KNOW I have sticks from an apparently bad batch.Their solution is to send me a new remote.  I KNOW that this will not help.  Sadly, the supervisor I spoke with acknowledged that the company is aware of problems and \"trying to fix them\" all the while selling bad product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "7/9", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I drove to two different Best Buys to snag the TV Stick.  Brought it home thoroughly excited and hooked it straight up to my Onkyo AVR and was greeted with nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Turns out the brilliant minds at Amazon engineering decided to make it not work with non HDCP compliant receivers and from other reviews some Samsung TVs.  So buyer beware if you had hopes of hooking this up to something Amazon never bothered to build it for.  Outside of that it works amazingly well.  Interface in nice, a little more laggy than the standard Fire TV but non noticeable to someone who doesn't own both.  The USB port is in an awkward position but is workable.  Setup was easy, however the intro video is amazingly annoying.  Would definitely recommend to anyone using on a TV or an HDCP compliant receiver.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "27/35", "author": "Albe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent way to make older tv smarter !!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mandar Waykul"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I purchased this for the special prime price of $20 but expected it to work very well and give me 1080p netflix in my living room, like the roku stick I have can do without problems, but no.

I don't want my HDMI ports riddled with sticks I have to toggle between, especially with finicky HDMI handshakes. I already have a great streaming media box, and while the Prime app on iPad is capable of streaming via Airplay to the AppleTV, it bugs out all the time. Very frustrating when you're trying to binge on a show. If Amazon would just release an AppleTV native app like Netflix, Hulu, Vevo, Youtube, Vimeo, and a dozen others I wouldn't have been lured into trying this. Oh jeez I guess their horrible plan worked. Fortunately I picked it up really cheap since I'll probably just leave it in a drawer now.STOP TRYING TO BE A HARDWARE COMPANY.Edit: because netscorer is butthurt over my review, allow me to elaborate on why this IS a review of the product. The Fire Stick and Fire TV are not innovative products, any more than their failed phone was. Even if you double the RAM of a Roku, it's not a new thing. By releasing their own products rather than adding their stream to existing, successful platforms, Amazon is not improving anything. They're creating ARTIFICIAL SEGMENTATION. That's my issue with this. I'ma Prime member, and knowing that Amazon would be 100% fully capable of spitting out a proper streaming app alongside Netflix on every existing piece of hardware, but doesn't so that can push their own plastic stick, is frustrating. I am a fan of Amazon as a service and a store, although I know they cause damage to other retailers in much the same way WalMart does. All I'm saying is, for the love of Jeebus just let it stop there already, and don't go out of your way to artificially make good, existing hardware platforms less useful.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "2/6", "author": "C.

Although I know it shouldn't matter, Amazon will likely not call this a verified purchase (even though my account is linked with the device), so please take that into consideration if Amazon flags this as unverifiable.Second, I am a happy owner of three Roku 3 boxes and have been using those for more than a year so I may be a bit spoiled or biased towards what I believe to be the Cadillac of streaming devices.Thirdly, I also own one Google Chrome Cast - a device which I am not really a major fan of.  In fact, I purchased the Fire TV Stick because of a couple of items that generally irk me about the Chrome Cast and is intended to replace that device.  The first issue is the lack of Amazon Prime streaming and the second is the requirement to use your phone or tablet to control the device.Now, on to my review of the device as I see it after having it for less than 24 hours.  I may amend the review as time goes on, especially if Amazon fixes some of the issues with Software Updates.1)  The setup process was not as smooth as it should have been.  After initially connecting to my Wi-Fi, it started to do a Software Update and then failed with a message saying something about being unable to connect to the service and to power-cycle the device.  After restarting the device, I had multiple failures of trying to connect it to my Wi-Fi even though my iPad was working just fine with it, so doubt that the Wi-Fi is truly my issue.  My strength is identified on the Fire TV Stick as \"Very Good\" and the router is about 7-8 feet from the device within the same room, so there aren't any major obstructions of the signal.2)  I have only watched one program on the device so far, and that was via the Netflix app.  However, during that viewing, the streaming was eventually interrupted and I was prompted to restart the device because it could not connect to the network.  After restarting it, I kept getting interrupted with Buffering issues and eventually dismissed the notification because it prompted me so often that at one point less it'd be less than two minutes between notifications.3)  Amazon really should allow people to filter \"Prime Video\" only within the Search option.  Sure, I realize that their goal is to Rent or Sell content, but when you search for something generic like \"Comedy\" and see a bunch of items available for rent, yet you have ZERO intention to pay to watch comedians that you've never heard of, it can be a bit frustrating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "14/17", "author": "Mr. Steven Fuhrman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great deviceNice and small with tons of benefits", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "pitangarang"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Though the stick seems awesome(just picked it up 3 days ago), I have some serious problems with the remote.
