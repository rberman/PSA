Unfortunately the only troubleshooting it tells you is to restart the device or move your router closer, I get full connectivity and after restarting I get the same issue.  I am unable to watch anything on this and have to go back to my old player.They also do not offer any other kind of troubleshooting, I wanted to go into the network settings and try to fix it but it simply only tells you connected with problems and there is pretty much nothing you can do to fix it.Edit: was able to fix it after a few hours, my suggestion is to keep restarting the stick and your router until it works.  It took me about 5 tries and waiting about an hour in between each time.Otherwise the fire stick is great once you get it working.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "anik9"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Streaming need alittle work", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "misha jeffers"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Overall I'm happy with the fire stick. But it does have a significant downside: the remote makes a really loud \"CLICK!\" sound with every button press--which I could get used to, but  my wife, not so much. I tried to muffle it (the remote, not my wife) by using it under a comforter and pillow, but that didn't help. Otherwise I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.

Tried it over and over on my TV in Hawaii. Ordered a replacement - same problem, could not connect to wifi from the start. Brought the replacement back to NC and it worked as it was supposed to. However, it was still much slower than my Roku and the descriptions of the movies do not load until you click to select the video which is really really annoying. Overall it works, I've been using it since I'm too lazy to change it back over, I like that you don't have to see it since it's behind the tv.
