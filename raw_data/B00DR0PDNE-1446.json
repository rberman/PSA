If you want to stream anything other than netflix, you better have a connection that is 75Mbps or more, as that is the speed I have in my house and it still has the hardest time streaming. The interface with netflix on iOS is attrocious and crashes the app constantly and required several attempts to get it functioning properly. Also, the chromecast does not support audio theough anything other than tv speakers, so if you want to run the chromecast into your tv and connect surround sound or a sound bar, forget about it.As far as the little streaming this device can do smoothly, it does it well, so I'll give it 2 stars. Had I of known of all of these short comings before hand I wouldn't have paid more than $10 for this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "trc"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product!!! I can listen to music on my tv, same with movies from either apps or browser, pictures, v\u00eddeos stores in my Mac or iPhone, etc. Not for everyone if you're looking for and a plug-n-play though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Patricia Solano Castro"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This would be 100% perfect if it supported Amazon streaming. I use a spare computer to stream Amazon like I did everything before getting ChromeCast, but if it did support it I could liberate the computer. Using my iPhone as a remote is very cool: the GUI for Netflix and Hulu is well designed and very easy to navigate. Also when I start casting it turns on the flat screen and switches to the assigned input source automatically.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Markus Unterberg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am in love with this product!!
