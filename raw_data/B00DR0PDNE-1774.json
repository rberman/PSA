[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Cannot cast to TV using Google Chrome for mobile on iOS. Unbelievable...I'm aware that it is compatible with a few iOS apps, such as Netflix, Hulu Plus, and YouTube, but to sell a product named Chromecast that cannot cast a browser window from Chrome is just ridiculous.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Megan F."}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "We bought two for the house, because we didn't want to spend the extra money on Apple TVs. Wrong decision. The whole \"no remote\" aspect is very very inconvenient. The vast majority of the time, the app loses the connect with chromecast after the screen shuts off. It takes on average a minute to pull it back up again. This goes for both of the chromecasts, which are run on separate wi-fi networks as well... So in essence, it's like losing your remote every time you start watching something. Sometimes, it flat out doesn't connect until you leave it alone for a while.To it's benefit, once the remote is up and connected, it loads fast and responds well to scrolling and pausing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Peggy Kyrkostas Ohanlon"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works well, but until it can display all regular websites, including streaming content, it is just a novelty that proves that even google is subject to the greed of media companies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matthew W Murphy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Came within two days use it all the time no problems at all does not connect to 5 mghz network", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mario"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great just wish it could handle more formats.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Charles Degen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to setup.

If you have great speeds, router, modem, and you use quality streaming sites, this will rock.Works best with YouTube and Netflix, but will work perfectly for almost any other site.Biggest con: shared WiFi network without individual passcodes. I gave one to each housemate who rents here, they can all use them equally, but all are visible on the WiFi network so any housemate can potentially hijack another housemates Chromecast and play 2 girls 1 cup or something of that sort. How good your honor system will define your experience.Also I got a HDMI to Component converter and double male ended cables to allow anyone to use the Chromecast on non HDMI televisions, and it works perfectly.The ability to cast  my entire screen makes it perfect for presentations and obscure websites that have players not supporting Chromecast", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Remrie Arrie \"\"I smile when you smile\" ~ Remrie\""}]
