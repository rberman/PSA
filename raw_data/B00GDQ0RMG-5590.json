[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "After getting it all hooked up and ready it works great. The apps and functionality are good, especially with kid related stuff. The little remote is also very easy for the kids to use. I'm waiting for the HBO go app and an Apple one and then it will be pretty much perfect.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jackie D"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is so easy to operate, my 2 1/2 year old can put on a show for herself! LOVE the creative galaxy show that is created for amazon, it has replaced all disney shows, thank goodness! Great that you can access music too! Perfect solution to high cable prices!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kyle"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "What is the point of the stick if you have to have a tv provider to watch any of the \"watch\" apps. On our tablet we can still get episodes and things for free with those apps but with the stick you have to choose a provider in order to get into the app or if you can get in it won't let you play anything. I also didn't like how it talked about having thousands of apps but I wanted the abc app and can't find it anywhere. So to sum up the only thing I can do with the stick that I cant do with my bluray player is watch amazon instant video but I could do this on our wii so this was a pointless purchase. So frustrated that I can get more tv on my tablet than this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Ashley Schwartz"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Interface is pretty good so far. Much better than the built in hub on my samsung smart tv...However, I am hugely disappointed that the showtime app is COMPLETELY USELESS if you are a Directv subscriber. If you have Directv and want to use the showtime anytime app tough luck. It isn't even on the subscriber option list. Therefore you cannot sign in and/or use the app. What a letdown.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BRIAN ROCK"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I bought this device to handle mirroring of my tablet to my television. It does not handle this. I guess according to the specs it must be a compatible device , I find that my ASUS memo must not be compatible. Sure I only spent $20 for fire stick but am not impressed basically all it does is stream a bunch of movies and tv shows from the usual sources , Netflix , Amazon instant video ans so on. Point is we all more than likely already have devices to do this. I do not have unlimited data on my internet so this is simply a waste.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Shirley crook"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Very disappointed. Not half as user friendly as a roku, the menu is a mess, and the first show I tried to play got stuck and I eventually just gave up trying to view it.

No matter where it is in the house you only get about 2 minutes of use and then it either freezes or just drops off. I loved the idea of a cheap small device that wouldn't take up space in my trailer but this is just too full of bugs to be useful.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Donald"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works just as good as roku.  Set up is easy and streaming fast and picture good.  I have used it mostly with netflix content and have had no problems.  I would diffidently recommend to anyone who is tired of broadcast networks with so many ads.  Amazon prime has many, many tv shows/movies available and none have commercials.  Just enjoy pure, uninterrupted entertainment with this little stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CAROL"}]
