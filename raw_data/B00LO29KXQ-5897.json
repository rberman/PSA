The interface is faster and better looking than my Roku. I like my Roku a lot, but I wanted to stream Amazon Prime on another TV, so I bought the Fire TV Stick because it was cheaper. So far I actually like it better. Only thing missing on the Fire TV Stick is the headphone jack on the remote that my Roku has, but that's not an issue for me on this TV, so I don't miss it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "YetiYeti"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "On Day 1, the Fire Stick was everything I dreamed it would be. Easy to set up and simple interface. I went on a Netflix binge for a majority of my day!  On Day 2-3.... It is about to be put in the box and shipped back to Amazon. It is poorly responsive at best. Sometimes taking up to a full minute to respond to just one click of the remote. Then it goes crazy and flips through pages like it is possessed. When I finally get to a show (which takes about 10 minutes of not so much patience and many expletives), it buffers several times. Not a wifi issue as I can stream the same content to both my phone and laptop with no issues.  Was truly excited for this product and am deeply disappointed That already I can't even use it. At least I got one day of Scandal Season 1 bliss from it, that is the only reason I gave an extra Star.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephanie"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Cannot view movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime.

I was lucky enough to get this for the ridiculously low price of $19, but even for $39, it's a tremendous bargain.This pushes Amazon Prime Content to your HDTV HDMI Input.  It's an amazing little piece of equipment.  The streaming is fast, almost instantaneous, and without lags or jumping or delays.  Of course, you need a decent internet connection.  If you have that, you are set.I love watching Prime Movies on my HDTV now, but it also streams great TV shows, HBO series, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, PBS, Crackle, and many others.  And, you get great Music streaming like TuneIn Radio, and Pandors.  Of course, all of your Amazon Music is pushed to the device.  I downloaded the \"Voice Recognition Remote\" to my Android Phone.  Works great, but the little remote that comes with it is just fine as well, it just does not do Voice Recognition to pull up videos.  Amazon has designed this device from the ground up to be SIMPLE and FUN to use.  What a GREAT entertainment accessory this is.  Sure beats viewing Prime on my Laptop, Tablet or Chromebook when I am home.One of the easiest decisions to buy in my experience with Amazon.  It's simply terrific.  Buy it and I'd be surprised if you were not completely satisfied.Thanks Amazing... I mean AMAZON!

Not sure why. Power from included USB power adapter and using hdmi extension with the wifi router 10 feet away.  The remote sometimes quits responding and is stuck on menu option and then jumps rapidly between menu options. Does not seem to matter what app I am using. Sometimes says it loses network connection. I thought maybe it was DHCP lease expiration but all other devices like my Kindle Fire TV and Chromecast work great. Hope there is a firmware upgrade that fixes the problem. I wish I had bought another full size Fire TV when it was on sale for $80 instead of the stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Thomas E.
