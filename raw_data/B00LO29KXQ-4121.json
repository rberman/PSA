Many of the apps freeze and crash. Load times are ridiculously long on some apps, but quick if you're accessing Amazon content. As far as accessing your Amazon and Amazon Prime content, there's nothing better, unfortunately I expected it to be more on par with Roku and it's not. Hopefully the next couple of months will bring some updates to the stick to make it more stable and bring the features advertised when I purchased it. There's promise with this gadget, but (as my grade school teachers used to say frequently) it isn't meeting its potential.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott T.

Had to call customer service for help.  After which, apps downloaded ok, but Netflix buffers a lot, and even get messages, unable to stream your movie at this time, please try again later. Very frustrating to watch movies when interrupted numerous times with buffering. I don't have that problem with Amazon videos. I have a fast broadband network with dual band Wi-Fi and never have that problem with my computer, laptop, or smart phone which are in same room as TV with fire stick. For the money, I probably shouldn't complain, but frustrating none the less.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "soonerbackhome"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works as advertised.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hootbro"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing and easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Justine McCabe"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great, easy install...Even shipped before original delivery date...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "fireman65737"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's a perfect option to convert your TV into an Smart TV.
