FAIL, you can only do this with Amazon video's. I like to watch CBS, ESPN, TNT..... and others.  If I am watching amazon on the tablet I would just turn on the Television and access Amazon through the stick.  I envision being able to do away with the an HDMI cable running from my computer to the Television or relocating my laptop, Definitely not what was advertised, going back to ROKU.amazon is proprietary: You cannot access GOOGLE store from a Kindle Tablet....., AMAZON should be careful or they will find themselves like BETA.

My son-in-law installed it in about 20minutes.  Apps are easy to get and use once you get an account with Amazon.  I like the idea of an RF wireless controller design as there's no issues with making sure you have to point it to the device.  The only down side to the regular controller is sometimes it double clicks which means you can pass the selection you want to make and you have to back track.  I'm going to get the upgrade controller soon because of that.
