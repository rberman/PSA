Amazon told me it'd be December 17th before I could expect delivery. I got it on December 6th ! UP and FULLY FUNCTIONAL IN LESS THAN AN HOUR ! And I'm NO TECHIE ! OUTSTANDING !I really like it allot. It took a \"little\" time till I figured out how to \"IT\" to my account; and a \"little\" time to figure out how to tie my  6 inch Fire HD to the Fire Stick / TV. My wife was ASTOUNDED and thrilled....My grandson, well, he put down \"his\" Fire HD and played the game apps on my Sony HD TV via Fire Stick...he loves.I highly recommend it. Easy set up; easy account synchronization; east sync with Fire HD tablets. (Our house now has [3] three.)
