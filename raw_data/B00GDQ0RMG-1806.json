My package containing the fire stick was two days late, which already put me in a mood, but I quickly turned my frown upside down when fedex finally dropped my fire stick off this afternoon. Downloaded Netflix, woo, yay, this is fun. Okay, what now... Hbogo, of course. Okay... Where is the charter login? Nope, don't see it... Okay, where is the xfinity log in, then to sign in my boyfriends account. Nothing. Google the issue and imagine my surprise when I have read several reviews and specs of this fire TV, that this stick naturally does not work with charter OR Comcast xfinity. Okay, not a big deal. I have my iPad, I can just keep do what I'm doing with plugging my iPad into my tv to stream... Okay. Showtime! Yay! They have xfinity. Okay, go activate that on my iPad. Showtime does not accept fire stick TV. At this point I have little hope my xfinity or charter is gonna work with anything else. If I had known this previously, I would've gone with chrome cast. If you're a Comcast or Charter user and you wanna use this app for anything other than Netflix and Hulu, you mind as well look elsewhere.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "AB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It was so easy to set up and it works great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Betty Boop \"Melody Skurdahl\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Its great I can catch up on all my programs and watch great movies, there's a variety of choices; very satisfied.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Redfeather"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works nice", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "james myers"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brenda Campbell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought as a gift for my mother in law.

This leads to it lagging and sometimes freezing, as it cant really be turned off and sleeping helps only a little it has to be unplugged to cool it off. Putting the device to sleep prevents that in the long run but as its used as a cable replacement in the house it often is being used while we are dozing off. Long story short to be a 5 star device all it needs is a sleep timer like most TVs have had for the last decade.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hobbs"}]
