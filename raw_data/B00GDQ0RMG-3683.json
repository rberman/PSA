My wife has an iPhone and I have an Android device which we have used for Chromecast viewing.  While the Chromecast has some limited uses for us, the Fire TV Stick blows it away in typical viewing.  By typical viewing I mean Netflix, Amazon Instant Videos, Sling TV, and more.  While I consider myself a geek and high tech, as others would consider me as well, the simple but effective remote for the Fire TV Stick just blows away using your smartphone.  There is just something nicer about navigating and selecting what to view on your TV with a the Fire TV Stick remote versus picking it out on your phone and submitting your selection to your router and sending it onward to the Chromecast.  We always have our smartphones on us, but it just doesn't feel the same.  The viewing experience is greater and better.  Choose this over the Chromecast for your high tech husband and especially everyone else in the world who isn't a geek.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Peter Roberts"}]
