I was concerned that my 2008 Samsung HDTV wouldn't be compatible but I had absolutely no problems. My wireless is set up on the other side of the house but, again, no problems at all.Be sure and set up the Amazon music app if you've purchased any music through Amazon. Be cautious when adding \"free\" apps because most have a subscription. I do stream Netflix but I'm also using completely free apps from PBS, Smithsonian and YouTube.

I feel it worked flawlessly, and turned any regular television, that's not connected to cable, into a loaded television with all kinds of opportunities ( yes, it will work on a television that has cable as well.) The games are fun to play, it streams very well, and has a wide range of choices; both free and pay. For the price I would suggest it over any competitor.  Also, ordering is very simple to do. Just click on the item you wish to pay for and the bill goes right on your Amazon credit card, or whatever credit card you have registered.
