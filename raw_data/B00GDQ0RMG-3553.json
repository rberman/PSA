Everything was working properly and I was recommending it to everyone I knew. Now a few month laters I wish I hadn't said anything. First of all, the main reason I bought it was so I could watch Netflix's. I have Prime as well but I do not like to watch movies and TV shows without subtitles because at times it can be very noisy in my house and I don't want to miss anything in my shows. Anyone, slowly at first it would give me a hard time to connect to the internet or would freeze but I figured out how to reset it and everything worked fine once I did that. But now for the past month, it won't let me use the Netflix's app. It's beyond irritating and I just want to throw the damn thing out. Everything else works ok but it keeps saying \"We're having trouble playing this title right now...\" no matter what I do, the app just won't work.I guess if you don't use Netflix's this will be good for you but I expect in the upcoming months this device will slowly stop working all together. I should've just gotten the Apple TV but they tempted me with the price. I love all things Amazon but I think the only electronics I'll be buying from them are there Kindles.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anna"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ivan Pitts"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "lots of fun movies and great TV shows", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bruce Josefson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Better than Chromecast!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Benjamin Peek"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeri DeMoss"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This really work great.
