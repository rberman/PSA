Its easy to set up and even though I can take it from one room to the next, I purchased another for the living room so that other members of my family may watch other shows and movies of their choice while I'm watching mine. I bought one for my son in Florida as well and he loves it.  It's perfect. I'd recommend the Amazon Fire TV stick. Shipping was fast, It's affordable, and with 8GB it can't be beat!
