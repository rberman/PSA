And good to go.. Wrong!!!  Plugged in after trying and retrying I got through step one.. Finally called Amazon.. The wanted the model# from my tv.. They could not find my model.. Seems the TV is too NEW!!!! Then they wanted me to go to setup..??!!! I could not find ... Finally in frustration I hung up...waited a few hours.. And now decided to call Samsung.. Maybe they could find \"set up\".. I was told they totally understood my frustration and would have someone help me.. After listening to music for 45 min... I hung up.. That was 3 days ago. I have not been able to bring myself to make another phone call..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Molly \"Love to read\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kristi"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Really hard to rate yet, had to order a WiFi booster as trying to watch anything with it so far stalls a lot with the \"buffering\" thing WI does - too slow of a connection to my internet I guess - although I pay for fastest.....

However, I also got the FireTV Box around the same time, and in comparison, the FireTV Box is far superior.Compared to other sticks out there, this is great - and a great price.  But if you want a processor that is going to keep up, buy the FireTV box, it is way worth the extra cost.  I installed KODI on it, and it is not fast enough to run x265.  The youtube interface is not nearly as good as it is on the FireTV Box.I do use it frequently, and have never had problem with it though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ty"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "paulie p"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great, very convenient.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "S Chamberlin"}]
