I returned it, too bad because I did love the thing when it worked but requiring me to reboot my router once a day is too much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G.

The other issue I run into often is the player crashes a fair bit.

I'm also deducting a star for how much power this thing uses, it gets pretty hot!  And that's just when it's idle, doing nothing.  Wish there was a way it could go into standby mode or something.So all in all I don't really use it that much.  My wife uses it to stream Pandora sometimes, or if we have friends over, sometimes we'll look up Youtube videos on it, but that's about it really.

It was so easy to install and you are able to carry it with you when you travel and attach it in your hotel (if it is hd-ready). It is worth every cent. In fact, I think it is underpriced. They should allow for there to be a two for one deal or a multi-room package so that you can cast throughout your home. I know longer have to hook up clunky wires to my TV from my laptop.

Unfortunately this is where the bad news starts. While I can Cast from a Chrome browser in general, Amazon Prime uses Silverlight which appears is not supported yet. When I cast the tab I see everything on the tab except the video itself. Hopefully Amazon will support casting directly, both to simply allow me to watch Amazon Movies on the ChromeCast\u201d\u3002", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kainy Guo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have never been a \"tech\" person.
