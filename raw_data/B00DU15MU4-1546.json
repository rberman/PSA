But - if i want to search Netflix only no way to do that - Also Amazon needs to open the gates to Apps like drop box. there are a few apps that back up the setup data to drop-box. then when you instill the app on a new device you can just import the set up. Very handy feature. My 101 year old Father-in-law loved looking at family pic on the TV. that one feature was worth the price of the Fire-TV for his enjoyment. It's crazy having to manage family pic in multiply places.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephen Raphaelson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A perfect addition to any system.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ken Burton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I think it's awesome, I don't miss my cable at all, get to see all my favorite shows and even catch up on ones that I missed.
