The remote doesn't feel all the strong but what do you expect for the price. I also read somewhere that you can download an amazon app to control it. I haven't gotten that far yet. But awesome product to do plex, hbo, netflix, hulu plug and amazon instant video", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kyle reasoner"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am very happy with this amazon fire stick , I plugged it in the back of my set, turned tv on, it found my wi fi connection, entered password and it walks you through set up with a tutorial which was very easy to understand. Navigation with the fire stick is also very easy and set up nice.
