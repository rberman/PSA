Despite the higher spec of this device, I find it doesn't perform much better than the chromecast. In fact, a lot of my media that streams perfectly on the Chromecast will tend to stutter on the Fire TV Stick (this is especially true for media streams via Plex). That being said, the interface is very convenient, as is the included remote. For basic usage with Amazon Instant Video and Netflix, this is perfect! For Plex media streaming, I would stick with the Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Vlad P"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "quick to set up and I have access to all the shows I  personally watch with a normal cable package....I also like the remote control", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "CFrances"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Seems to work as expected.

Very thoughtful HDMI 'extender' allows the stick to reach above the receiver so that the remote can talk to it. Interface to content, and for setup, is wonderful, the best of all our inputs including Comcast, AppleTV. Content selection is awesome.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carlick"}]
