This is the first time I have been disappointed. I wanted to use the mirroring feature--wirelessly project whatever was on my laptop to the flat screen in my bedroom. It was easy to set up, but I tried to play a movie, and I could not get audio. I called Apple and they told me that my macbook air was probably not compatible, which was not true. Then I was told that my router was probably not powerful enough. (I just bought a time capsule so that was not it). I then was routed to technical, and talking to them, it sounded as if other people were having this issue. Final resolution was that I probably had some type of interference that was disrupting the audio. It turns out when I tried the apple tv in another room it did work, however the volume thru the flat screen TV is still supressed. Apple's final recommendation is that I connect the device with an ethernet cable. If I wanted to go that route I could just have connected my laptop the flat screen to begin with.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "jaquee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This product is wonderful and we are thoroughly enjoying it.

If WiFi service in the dorm is through a \"captive network\" (ie, one requiring authentication before letting a user onto the internet), Apple TV does NOT work (ie, it won't sync with iTunes, and your computer will not recognize the device). Apple tech support says that Apple TV won't work with a captive network, and that I should buy a router and set up my own wireless network in the room--the school, however, won't allow me to do this. Come on, Apple! You had to know that this would be problem! Apple TV should come with a big black-box warning that it may not work in dorm rooms! How about a little truth in advertising! Right now, my Apple TV is just a nice shiny black paperweight", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "7/21", "author": "G.

For starters, all the TV shows, movies, and music I've purchased through iTunes is available through this device via \"the cloud.\"  I can also access through \"the cloud\" music stored on my computer (I haven't purchased from iTunes) via the \"iTunes Match\" Service.I just watched the season 5 finale of BREAKING BAD on this device. I did not have to wait about 15-20 minutes for the 2 GB file to download to my computer. It was available immediately for instant viewing through Apple TV!  Another great benefit of this device is that you can stream videos from Netflix and Hulu!  Picture and sound quality is outstanding(I have a 720p HD TV).I love the fact that I can also control my Apple TV through a \"Remote\" app on my iPad.  So, if I ever break or lose my Apple TV remote, I can still use my iPad! Apparently, you can also use your iPhone and iPod touch as well. There are a lot of other outstanding features of this product; I  encourage you to read other reviews and the product description.This product is yet another reason why Apple is so successful and why they're recognized as a tech giant.  I prefer the word \"juggernaut!\"  Anyway, if you love Apple products and you have invested a good amount of money in iTunes content, you gotta get this product!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Introspective Falcon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I had the original hard drive based apple tv and was disappointed by it. Too much syncing/buffering. Quality of video was good, not great. And no services other than iTunes video.This has all changed. Netflix, Hulu, NHL, well you know the rest. Tons of streaming subscription services built in and then iTunes pay as you go to fill in the rest.Plus AirPlay from my iPad is AWESOME. just had a fantasy football draft and mirrored the results to my big screen from my iPad.I usually leave my tv on in the background when I'm sitting around and it's nice to play music through my surround sound and have the photo stream screen saver pull up all my photos from the last 30 days or just coming across a random Internet video or highlights from last nights game and being able to have them play automatically on the TV is nice.VERY happy with this version, thinking about picking up another one for the bedroom! Great device for cutting the cord and breaking free of cable/sat!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Casey Smigelski"}]
