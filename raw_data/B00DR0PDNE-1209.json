As such, the Chromecast negotiates  (by means of EDID through your HDMI cable) with your TV the highest resolution your TV can support. Your TV or monitor may report, for example, that it is capable of 1080P resolution, but in reality due to some inherent limitations, incompatibility or other unknown issues it does not really handle this resolution very well. As a result, the picture may be garbled, distorted, or black out, totally unusable.If Chromecast allowed to you to manually select a different  resolution, such as 720p in this case, then your TV would have been able to properly display the picture.  Unfortunately, despite many complains about this fundamental limitation on the forums, Goggle have not even attempted to fix it or even acknowledge it as a problem!So this is one star for a product, which basically does not work with some older TVs or monitor.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Digital Flashback"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Gad to return it.
