I don't have any connection problems what so ever but I also have Internet that runs 135mbps. For people having issues with Internet connection you might have to increase your speed, just like Xbox live you need decent Internet to get good quality picture and no lag.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ana"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Wish screencasting was a lot easier.

I prefer Roku.  I got this because Chromecast and Apple TV don't support Amazon Prime.  I find this to be unnecessarily cluttered and I hate the touchpad iPhone remote app.  (The iPhone app gets very high ratings on the App Store, so I guess it's just not cutting it for me.It works well and doesn't crash, etc. however it's a personal preference thing for me.  I cut the cord a few months ago, so I live on Netflix, Amazon Prime along with some Youtube and Crackle, so I only watch online streaming video and it should be a smoother experience then it is.  None of the streaming devices (Chromecast, Fire TV, etc) do a great job in my opinion, but I like Roku the best.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "M.

Worked better than expected, connected it to the TV, went through the setting configuration process, and took a few minutes mostly because I use a long Wi-Fi password.Once configured I downloaded the Plex app from the store, sign in and boom 15 minutes tops (from getting out of the box to running a movie from my server) I  got mi full movie catalog on my \"dumb\" tv. As a plus I got the catalogue as an Amazon Prime member and my netflix account.Compared to the Chromecast I used before, this is way better.The only con i found is the Plex app makes ad adjustment to your screen resolution and the frame goes out of proportion, so you have to set it up to the original setting", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel G\u00f3mez Ram\u00edrez"}]
