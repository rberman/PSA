[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "this has replaced a boxee box in the bedroom. i have to admit that I approached this tiny gadget with much apprehension; but at $19, i thought it was worth a try. I had received it a few weeks back but in the back of my mind i was thinking this wouldn't work and didn't have the motivation to tinker with it to get it working. I quickly found how mistaken I was!pros:1. wireless - works incredibly well; the old boxee box wireless was worthless and I was a bit apprehensive about the firestick, but i was able to stream some very high bit rate content. i have a firetv and the only difference is that when rewiding/fast forwarding the firestick takes a second or 2 to buffer while the firetv is virtually instanteneous.2. open - with adb turned on; any app can be side loaded. I was able to get kodi/xbmc gotham 13.2 up and running in no time3. kodi gotham 13.2 runs unbelievable well - high bitrate movies work great; i have only a few frames dropped on some very large bitrate items. in fact it worked better on some movies than 13.1 on my firetv; so I immediately upgraded firetv to 13.2.4. compact and easily hidden; radio remote is awesome. don't really use the voice with xbmc. i was able to configure the keymaps they way we like the remote and it works perfectly.5. i got it when it was $19 - and this has to a better deal that the rpi which I have played with as well; still think this is a better bang for the buck at $39 given the other apps (netflix, prime instant video, etc) that it boasts.cons:1. usb power cable is too short; i have the bedroom tv mounted above standing eye-level; so landed up have to include an extension which is not very aesthetic for now.summaryoverall, I'm very impressed by this tiny flash drive looking this. I own the chromecast, boxee box, firetv; owned for a short while all three versions of the apple tv; built my own openelec media center; and this HAS to be the best bang for the buck even at $39; and at $19 it was a steal!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BCHOOR"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic product.

Had some initial issues with my Kindle not mirroring (with anything, including the TV stick, not a TV stick issue!).  A few phone calls and Amazon forum threads and Amazon figured out the problems and in heroic fashion came through with an update to the Kindle.The responsiveness and fluidity of the action on the screen is amazing.  Very fast.  Netflix works great.Much more user friendly than other casters.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Radio Davio"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really like this device! I was able to preorder it for half off, as a Prime member. Setup was pretty easy and so far I haven't experienced much lag in movie or tv playback but Prime music on the other hand is a bit of a problem, I have experienced some songs stopping and taking a few seconds to play. I haven't had time to use it on a daily basis to see if any issues were cleared up but overall I have enjoyed using the fire stick and enjoy using it as a replacement for cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"detroitmel\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I have to agree with previous poor reviews that this is a terrible product. It just doesn't work. It would not maintain a WiFi connection at all on our large-screen (46\") HDTV, although all of our Apple and Kindle products have no trouble, always full bars. So I tried it on a smaller TV that sits literally right next to the modem/router. Success, but it was short lived. I was able to start watching a TV episode, yay!! But then I loaded on the Netflix app, and it rebelled. The stick would not open Netflix then refused to connect to the WiFi at all. Half-a-dozen restarts later of the TV, modem/router, and Firestick settings and it still refuses to connect to WiFi, says it is \"not in range.\" IT'S SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO IT!!! I wanted to delete the Netflix app but I can't even get it to do that. I give up. So, even though I only paid $19 for it, I'm sending it back and trying a Roku 3. Amazon needs to know how bad this product is!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/4", "author": "GolfingGal"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!  Streaming videos from Mac OS X with Plex video server is great as well.  Just $4.99 for the app on Fire Stick.  Totally worth it.One thing I wish they fix in the future is the Parental Controls.  When you enter the 5 digit number to unlock games/videos/apps/purchases, you have to select the digits on screen which gives away the password to anyone looking.  I have to make sure my son is not looking at the TV when I enter the code, lol.  I would much rather have the various buttons UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT represent a code/pattern that I have to enter and press the center button to commit the code.  Even if that was 6 digits UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT it would be easy to remember. ;-)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brett"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great device, easy to use, quick.
