Easy to follow instructions for set up. I loved my TV before but this was my first 1080p Movie watched and the quality of image was shocking. My TV tells what the input is and my Cable company's idea of HD is 720p. I love TV without commercials. There are SO many movies that I have never seen and now I can treat myself to some great entertainment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TimsWoodArt \"TimsWoodART\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing!

While buying and installing the device I was Amazon Prime user, so expect to see movies and music available (in theory) for this type of user. The truth is that despite the globalized world, Prime services are only available in USA and it was very frustrating to have nothing further to Chromecast that I already had, I admit it's nice to have a remote control, but in practical terms for users who are out of USA does not have anything extra..In short, not recommended for those who live outside the US, because even when you're willing to pay for content is not available.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Robin"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Would not allow me to enter my WiFi password even though it found the name of the WiFi.
