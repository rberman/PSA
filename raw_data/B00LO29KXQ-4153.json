I thought that if I could stream on Kindle Fire HDX, then I could mirrorcast it to the Fire Stick.  This doesn't seem to be working.  I can't mirrorcast it at all.  Sort of a disappointment but understand that it is mostly due to our slow connection.  Without a high speed/type internet, I wouldn't bother with this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Too many free movies to watch in a lifetime.

I could not get the Fire Stick to connect to my Wifi. I googled the issue and saw there were a bunch of Amazon related threads for troubleshooting with people having similar issues. I followed the instruction as per those links (unplugging router/wireless, restarting, un-powering/rebooting device, etc.)  and was unable to get my device to connect. I tired calling amazon customer service for tech support and they were of no help either.
