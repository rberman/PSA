Also I understand that the Chrome tab casting is beta so it might work, not guaranteed. It doesn't work through VPNs. Doesn't support full 1080p streaming. Doesn't like 5GHz or Dual-Band 2.4GHz/5GHz routers. It only supports android 2.3 or higher.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/7", "author": "A. C.

Right now, it handles YouTube, Netflx and basic webpages (think Google + photos) really well.  It is not compatible with any other streaming service at this point.  If you try to stream from other websites, the ChromeCast downgrades the frames per second live which causes delay in streaming and pretty low quality.  Right now, we use the Roku as our primary streaming device.  The Roku definitely performs better at this point.  The ChromeCast is small, easy to install and works great for youtube to tv.  There is no doubt that Google will continue working on this device.  For tech nerds such as myself, it's worth the $35.  However, if you are not an early adopter, you'll easily see why the price is so low.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/3", "author": "Jeremy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Attaches quickly. Easy setup. Easy connection to the network. My greatest joy is being able to control the device from my laptops and Android devices - it is so much easier to control than similar devices because it is easy to to use the full applications when searching and navigating vs using a remote control and typing one letter at-a-time, etc. Love it.

That's it.  If this is what you are looking for, this product is perfect.  If not, then this product is not for you.My major use is playing songs on Google Music on my home theatre receiver.  I like the fact that i can turn on some music anywhere at home using just my phone.  This is very similar to Airplay on iPhone, except that that it does so without draining my phone's battery, since it's streaming directly from Google Music cloud service, and my phone only acts as a controller.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Phong Pham"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is NOT my first streaming media appliance, so I've had a bit of experience with the different technologies.  This one's a lot different from my WDTv, TiVo, and Sony Smart DVD.  Of the four, the Chromecast has the BEST netflix quality and overall user experience of all of them, and for that alone, it's worth the getting.SETUPOut of the box, the HDMI dongle plugs into your TV, or, AV AMP.  I elected to go to the back of the amp, and I used a 3 foot HDMI extension to bring the dongle out of the furniture where the wireless signal would be clean.  It comes with a small extender of its own (about 3 inches).  Because my amp didn't have a USB port, I just used one on the Samsung TV instead.  It worked perfectly.  This is nice because you don't have to go finding another 120v outlet for it.Instructions on the screen were simple, and I had the thing streaming Netflix, YouTube, and my music from Google Play within a few minutes time.PROBLEMSUnfortunately, I came up against some things I expected to be able to do, but can't.1) Interface to Google Chrome Browser doesn't work for iPad.  After 20 minutes of screwing about, I finally found a google page that said \"not YET available, but SOON\".2) I had a similar problem with my Android phone.  Went to download the chrome browser, and got \"Not a Compatible Device\"  My smart phone is only 2 years old, so I found it irritating that an ANDROID phone couldn't load a working browser.These two items make it impossible for me to take advantage of one of the key features of the Chromecast.3) Not sure why, but the graphics shown when streaming music from Google Play are REALLY horrible - it looks worse than an 8 bit blurred rendition of the album cover.FINAL NOTESI'm going to hold on to this - I have hopes that compatibility with other apps will improve.  Hopefully, I'll be able to watch my AMAZON PRIME movies on it too - that would be nice...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "7/8", "author": "PK"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i purchased Chromecast from BestBuy where it had 3 months of Netflix offer and quick delivery.first impression after using Chromecast for 2 days has been extremely positive.  though my TV Panasonic VIERA TC-L47E50 has both netflix and youtube i went with chromecast since browsing YouTube using TV remote was not so good, alternate option of pairing my smartphone with youtube/TV did helped but again not as convenient as Chromecast which was breezing fast and super easy.chromecast worked perfectly fine with my Panasonic VIERA TC-L47E50 and i did not had to connect to external power source as the USB port in TV itself worked.tested Chrome browser casting over wifi and i was able to play a full length movie from internet without any lag or sound issue.  since long i was exploring option to mirror my laptop output to TV and now i am very happy that chromecast did this for me with just 35$.i have already recommended several of my friend about chomecast and i am very sure none of them will be disappointed with there chromecast purchase.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
