It worked for about a half an hour then lost connection.  It keeps telling us it can't find our Wi Fi.  We have done everything to trouble shoot and nothing helps.  On the one hand it tells us we have a good signal on the other it says we don't.  Very Very disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Margaret M.

The setup was easy but seems to require a stronger wifi signal than appletv or even Xbox. Had to reset the device all over again because it would not stay on the network, kept connecting then disconnecting.It's and android device so take that for what that's worth. I kind of expected a little more from it but overall for the price it's a good deal.* Update: After traveling with the item it appears that the WIFI hardware in this product is juts not very good. Unless the signal is SUPER string it just will not work. The AppleTv in the same locations works fine... just going to use AppleTv now for travels.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Daniel Presedo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent so far", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ro of Bowie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.

Coming to it from a chromecast and looking to replace an appleTV.  A ton better than either.  I love that it stands alone and that it doesn't another device attached to it.
