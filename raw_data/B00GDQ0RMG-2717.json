The Firestick is an excellent value.  I have only had this for two days, but I am already really enjoying it.  It was extremely easy to set up, it only took a few minutes.  After downloading a few additonal apps, I was watching tv and catching up on the shows I have missed.  The included remote is fantastic, and, although it is not a voice remote, it is still easy to click through apps and programs.  The onscreen tutorial was also very well done and easy to follow.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TimFromWimberley"}]
