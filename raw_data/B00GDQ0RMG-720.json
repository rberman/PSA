I have a WD media player that does similar things, but wanted something that was easily portable.  This definitely fits the bill!  I like how easily accessible amazon prime movies and shows are and the reliability of playback has been great.  Very little to no buffering as I experienced with other devices.  I would highly recommend!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "A.

I've bought a new router because I needed one anyways but even this did not seem to solve the problem. I always get connection issues causing me to have to restart the Fire Stick. Get use to the network connection error message. Still slow to load when I am in the middle of movies.(Buffer City)Commercials show Gary Buesy holding a stick. You actually need an external power cord they do not show in the commercial or in the display picture. Power cord comes with device but was still kind of disappointed to have to plug it in versus having it powered by the TV port.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ross Gallant"}]
