All of the movies I uploaded are sorted by date created.Old movies that I had transferred from film to an electronic media show up in my library on the date I transfered them, and I can't sort it any other way. The names of my movies that I uploaded to the Amazon cloud Drive do not appear when viewing them using my fire TV stick. There is no way to make the fire stick display the movie title.pictures I loaded to my cloud Drive appear as one jumbled mess by date on the Amazon fire TV stick.  I spent time with customer service to figure out how to improve the organization of the fire TV stick. They have said that this is not possible right now.  Amazon will never compete with the AppleTV unless they update user interface. Amazon should allow a rating of zero stars for this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "eric devine"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "works really well on accessing my Prime stuff...navigation a little clunky but eventually I figured it out...instructions could be clearer...I'm quite pleased that I can watch Dr Who on the big screen and since I don't have TV up here (Alaska) just internet it's a big help and the YouTube app works well too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael Baish"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I'm disappointed that the Fire Stick doesn't have as many apps available like Roku does.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Barbara Henderson"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Wish there was a shut off button.
