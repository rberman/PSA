The video is choppy and about once a day it freezes and takes about 30 seconds to register each remote button push.  I have to shut down the whole TV/video/stereo system for a few seconds and reboot.  There is a \"reset\" button under system tools which works if you can get to it, but when the system is frozen you have no choice but to cut the power and start all over again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
