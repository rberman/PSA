[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Overall, we're pretty satisfied with the Fire Stick. Setup is easy and the menu is intuitive. The remote works well although I wish I could control it with my Logitech Universal remote. I have experienced some hesitation and \"crashes\" while watching a movie. It's only happened during one movie and I hope it's the only time it'll happen.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "pubprof"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it best investment", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joya Hawkins"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I found the picture misleading and did not realize it required plugging a power cable into the stick for it to work.
