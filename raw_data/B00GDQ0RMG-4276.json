[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I cannot even rate the actual value of this item even though I have had two sent to me. The first apparently had an identical serial number as someone else's product and therefore could not be registered. It had to be returned. The reconditioned replacement would not even turn on because it had old software. It had to be returned too. I have spent two hours 'using' these two items and was never even able to get to the home screen. Incredibly frustrating. Would give 0 stars if possible.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ann"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "only difficulty was opening remote to install battery but got instructions on Youtube.
