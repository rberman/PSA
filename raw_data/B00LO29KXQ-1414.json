Much easier than lugging the Xbox up and down the stairs to watch Prime or Netflix. Has to be plugged into a power outlet. I have one crappy cheap tv that this will not work with, due to a \"hump\" the tv manufacturer placed just under the hdmi outlets for some reason.  The remote is so small and black that it was even easier to lose than my other remotes, so I put a colorful sticker on it.Just had this about a month, but so far great. Much easier to use and faster to navigate than our old ps2 and xbox 360. Picture thru this is great as well.  A good buy @ $40.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "an"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I already owned a chromecast, but really wanted to be able to stream my prime videos, so I got the fire stick. It is so much better than chromecast that I am now trying to sell the chromecast. I can also watch hbo go, which is sweet. It's also much less clunky than CC or Roku. The only thing it's missing for me is Spotify, but I am more than happy with the fire stick. Highly recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bteg801"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "James Smock"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use.
