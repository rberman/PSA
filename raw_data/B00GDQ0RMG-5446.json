[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "Sluggish performance. Some apps, namely Hulu do not function well on it. The streaming pauses frequently. I have Roku devices on wifi in the house that don't have any issues with Hulu. I tried the Fire Stick from multiple locations and had issues from every one. Upon searching, it seems others had issues as well. The voice search worked well on it, but I ended up returning it and purchasing another Roku. Can't deal with the constant streaming issues with the Fire Stick. I'm sure it will get better as they update the device, but it's just not ready for prime time right now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "M.
