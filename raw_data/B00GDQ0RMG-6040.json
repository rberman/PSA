[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Satisfied with the streaming experience and choice of the channels. The interface is also very slick and the voice search (Android app) is awesome. The only issue was set-up ... the software download stalled many times and no clear instructions or help on Amazon website. Finally, I followed the suggestion on reddit and used the HDMO extender dongle at which point things started working. I am still using the dongle and not directly attaching the stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this for my old 720P LCD TV that is not compatible with chromecast and it works!  The setup took about 20 minutes and that included the update. So far so good streaming Amazon video, Netflix and ESPN.  The remote is a nice feature to have.Note: I did the pre-order from prime but couldn't wait till Jan so I got mine at Staples on sale", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "zd"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very simple to install.

The remote is cheap. Luckily there is an app to replace the remote. It is nice to have 8gb of storage. Other than that it is basically a chromecast. Nothing special.

We also have Prime which is perfect because we don't have a lot of extra unused stuff like others have stated.  The menu and playing is very much like Roku but just seems to be better, the roku has a few extra steps to get apps to change apps. Love how to find other apps and how easy it is to get the apps. We are using the remote that it came with, however we did download the remote app on our android. And what a great remote that is, way easy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dan kane"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great for prime, netflix and hulu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "abraham hunt"}]
