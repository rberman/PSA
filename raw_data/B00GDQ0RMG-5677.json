Originally on back order until Xmas, was pleasantly surprised to receive it two weeks sooner.We have been using the Fire Stick for three says now as our primary method of TV watching for Netflix, etcetera. Each day, we are booted off of the program due to internet connection issues. We often have to restart the Fire Stick 2-3 times before it will work again. This is frustrating as there are no known other issues with our home internet service. Overall a good product but seems that Amazon still needs to fix some bugs with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Angie L"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've only used it a few times, but so far so good.  The interface was peppy, streaming worked well, it had no problems with my wifi.  I downloaded and used the android app, and that worked as expected too.  If you want an inexpensive streaming device you can easily carry in your overnight bad, this is a compelling consideration.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G.

The performance is excellent and the quality of the picture is great. The reason for the three stars is because of the wifi reception. It turns out that because the wifi signal is coming from the direction behind the tv, it had problems streaming video. After adding an HDMI extension cable, so that the fire stick was in front of the tv, everything work great. I could of purchased the fire tv if I had to place it in front of the tv; therefore, I did, and I give the fire tv five stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "etm"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's sweet!

I bought it two weeks ago and have called amazon 5 times regarding the fire stick.  It wont connect to wireless.  Occasionally it will work if you do a hard rebot but then if you switch to TV and back to watching a movie you have to do a hard rebot everytime.

Now you have to know, you have NO WAY of knowing if the remote is working or not.  You put in the batteries and press buttons.  If the stick responds, then you have a connection.  For us, it took 4 sets of batteries and multiple \"reboots\" before we got the connection.  Woo Hoo!  Note that set #1 was included with the Fire stick.  Sets 2 and 3 were found around the house, and set 4 is brand new from the store.So I get connection and find that the remote is a piece of work to negotiate the numbers for my net key.  Oh my goodness, it is horrible.  Click it once and it toggles over anywhere from none to 8+ numbers.  And with the 3 second delay, one never knows if it took or not... oops, it did!  Passed the number!Lastly, it won't connect to my internet.  Several minutes to negotiate the entrance of 10 numbers each time, and it fails to connect!  I have signal, don't know what is the issue.  After several tries, I'm done.And lastly, where's the customer support?  I will gladly update this review once I can get it working, but at this point, I'm an unhappy customer with a piece of junk electronic gadget.----------------------UPDATE---12/17/2014-----------------------So we got an email from ACS, and after those tips didn't work, I spoke with service rep, who after working through his tricks, agreed to expedite a replacement unit.  In the meantime, I noted a comment elsewhere that a trick or two worked for some folks - use the short HDMI extender / try a different HDMI port.  When the replacement wasn't connecting, I tried using the extender.  Oh goodness!  The Stick worked and recognized the remote.  The remote worked and only moved one number for each click (Hallelujah!!)  The unit connected to my WiFi.  And I was able to stream a movie on Prime without any issue!I'm going to give it a couple of weeks and then update the review and rating.  For now, today, it's a 5, which averages to a 3 with my original 1 rating!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "D. Waterman"}]
