[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great for the price,especially if you have Amazon Prime. It sets up easily, the remote is a much friendlier controller that the Chromecast iPad/iPhone set up and I have experienced no drops during play as I often did with Chromecast . I did experience some initial long delays in reaching full 1080p resolution in Netflix,but that has largely resolved. For the money it's a good choice for streaming.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Product is user friendly with many entertainment options.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Meagan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.

I previously purchased & returned Google Chromecast. The Fire stick was soooooo much easier to use & is actually faster loading Netflix than it is through our Blu Ray player hooked to another tv.

I received this FireStick as a gift for Christmas. My kids and I loved playing games and using YouTube's TV Queue as a Karaoke! By February, I had to unplug the power cord often to reset the system because various apps stopped working while running or the device woukd freeze. Eventually, this unplugging of the power cord became multiple times daily. Now, Netflix and YouTube don't work at all - the main apps I use. I will go back to using my Google ChromeCast which, thus far, has had zero problems. ChromeCast doesn't have all the awesome games nor the remote like FireStick, but at least it works.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G.
