I'm very disappointed in the free content available with my Prime membership.  Any TV show newer than about 3 years old requires a fee.  There is no way to only view free content either.  You have to select each show or move to see whether or not it's free.  It's way too easy to purchase as well.  I turned on the parental controls to try to prevent accidental orders but found that to be extremely frustrating because it wanted the PIN even to watch something free (I only had parental controls turned on for purchases).  Unless you have a fire phone, there's no way to view pictures and video from your phone without first uploading to the amazon cloud.  I was expecting a way to view my phone screen on the TV but no way to do that either.  I thought this would be a good substitute for Apple TV since I already had a Prime membership but turned out to be useless.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "amazon customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Met expectations", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susan R.
