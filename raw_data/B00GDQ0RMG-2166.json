Now through the magic of the fire stick I no longer have to watch blues clues or rug rats or pippi long stocking on my tv. I now have the freedom to watch sports  once again or perhaps movies with things that explode. These are the things my tv was made for. Thank you fire stick.

The only glitch I noticed so far was the audio desyncing from the video in HBOGO, but it works fine on other apps. It's easy to navigate, has all my content from Amazon, and the wife and kids can use it seamlessly. So far I'm impressed, though I do with it came with the voice remote :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Will"}]
