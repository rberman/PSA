Excellent streaming stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R. Jung"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "We bought this Fire TV stick because it was super cheap for Prime members. We've been using our smart blu-ray player to watch Amazon Instant but it was cumbersome to wade through the user-UNfriendly menus. In fact, it was so irritating, we rarely watched anything via Amazon. So when this was on sale I figured that for the price we might as well give it a try.So far, so good! Very intuitive menu system. No more wading through one screen after another to finally get to the good stuff. One click and you're right there. The remote is easy to use and intuitive. 99% of our TV watching is done via the AppleTV (we cut the cable cord years ago) and I'd hoped that the Fire TV Stick would be as easy to use and it is.Hubby set it up and I don't recall hearing any muttering or grumbling as he did so. So installation is a breeze, using it is a breeze... we like it! We like it so much, we've watched more from Amazon Instant over the last few weeks than we have ever watched.Oh, and it's easy to pack and go with you. We're heading out of state for Christmas and will be bringing our AppleTV and Fire TV Stick with us. All our content available wherever we happen to be. Living in today's world is pretty spectacular. Remember the days of the TV's that didn't even have a remote? Gah.This is a great addition to our non-cable TV viewing.

I have had issues with both sound and wifi connection. Both easily resolved with restarting the stick. That can be easily done by using the remote. Really wish I didn't have to run power to the stick, especially since the cord is so short and my tv is wall mounted. I did appreciate the hdmi cable extender. My tv has the hdmi ports tucked into a small corner that is curved. Without that extra cord I would have damaged the stick just trying to insert it. I also love that the remote can be used without having to face a certain direction.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AlaskanMommy \"Alaskan Mommy\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is truly a great device that's an inexpensive way to get premium entertainment without paying your (most likely creepy) television provider for sub-par content. One thing that seems like an oversight is that it was not released with Audible support.I'm usually a pretty forgiving person, and I'm not sure whether it's a letdown due to Audible or the Fire TV team, but it seems that if you release a product it should be able to support all of your brands, particularly when the two are media-focused.I have dozens of audio books and am frequently purchasing new ones through Audible. I have to plug in my phone with an 1/8\" jack in order to listen to audio books on my home theater receiver. First world problem, for sure, but the Fire TV Stick (made by Amazon, obviously) and Audible (Amazon company): you would think everything would \"just work\", right?If you're trying to provide media products and services, make sure your media-providing subsidiaries are in line with your overall vision. It just doesn't seem like that's the case with Audible. Far be it from lil' ol' me to preach to Amazon about their business practices, however: doesn't this seem like common sense?And the rest of the Fire TV Stick?
