However, the Hulu app for the Fire TV Stick is just awful. It freezes constantly, and the video often goes black while audio playback continues. I have given up on using this for steaming Hulu, which is unfortunate, since that was one of the main reasons that I purchased this device. The Fire TV Stick also has less content available than other devices like the Roku, which I use for another TV in the house. However, keep in mind that the Fire TV Stick is slightly cheaper, so that is also a consideration.I would gladly revise this review at a later date if the Hulu app becomes workable and/or more content becomes available. It's not a bad product, but could have been a lot better.Updated  7.24.15Well, I'm not sure what happened, but I tried using Hulu again recently and it worked flawlessly. That and the addition of additional apps (especially HBO Go and Starz Play) turn this in to a 5-star product for me.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Elizabeth"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Ok so I officially cut the cable cord thanks to this handy little device.
