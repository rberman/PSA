We have one of these as well as one of the regular Fire TVs. Both have the same interface and we haven't noticed much difference in terms of usability and performance. We've purchased similar devices from other retailers and this one is much faster and more reliable while providing some great content. As the description says, the device does not come with the same remote as the regular Fire TV does, but that is one of the only noticeable differences between the Stick and the regular Fire TV and you can get that functionality through the remote app.Bottom Line: this product works extremely well and is a must have for amazon prime members.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tcstitt5269"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The idea is great but the selection of free shows and movies is sparse.

Honestly.  Works exactly as described. Setup is as easy as described.  It actually motivated me to ditch my previous ISP because I had slight buffering issues; once I changed ISP not a single buffer.  It has a great screensaver that you can customize with your own pictures via Cloud. Access to your shows, apps, music.  What more can you ask for?  100% recommend.  I was one of the lucky ones that purchased during the 2 day sale for $19!  The delivery date was sometime after Christmas but got an email one day saying it would be shipping soon and I ended up getting it on or about Dec. 11th.  Absolute great option for any household.
