[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have heard the hype of this item for a while now, and I wanted one as well since the price was only $35. Out of the box, you get the HDMI dongle, a micro USB cable, and an AC charger. The build quality of all three items are pretty good, it doesn't feel cheap, and can interchange with any charger and other micro USB that I have.Using on the Chromecast was a bit more trivial than I wanted. Chromecast can be setup with an android device or your PC, and setting it up to your internet is fairly straight forward, but beyond that wasn't clear. I was stuck until people said to click on the \"Chromecast button on your chrome browser or certain android apps\". I expected it to be more intuitive with how to use it, but I guess I was one of the only people who didn't get it immediately.Now that I had officially figured out how to use the app, I was ready to start using it. Netflix seemed to load up well, and then I waited Google Music, and waited, and waited. There seems to be a software bug when switching these apps from one to another. Netflix seems to have the best support and will work every time I try to stream that app, but Plex and Google Play will have several problems with loading and will even stop playing for a moment, and then work again.Overall, the hardware is amazing, and the software needs updated. As soon as the software and is the software is smoother, I will give it 5 stars.Pros:+ $35. Cheap.+ Lightweight and Portable. Able to travel with this device anywhere.+ Able to turn any Dumb TV into a Smart TV. Use Nextflix, Plex, and Google Play anywhere.+ Includes AC adapter, and uses micro USB+ Easy to set-up with both Chrome browser and Chromecast AppCons:- Usage isn't intuitive.- No real interface, unlike android OS.- Can't add apps to Chromecast itself.- If no browser or android device, then unable to be controlled.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Charles Spanky \"Spanky Tech Reviews\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "After several months, it still works. I use it with more than the advertised sites--quality is dependent on the wireless setup, but it works well.

We mainly use it for Netflix.  But when Google opens it up so that the TV networks can add support, this will be our main media player.  I love using it in conjunction with our Nexus 7 to search for things to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lynn A.

The Chromecast gives you a slim device that can be powered by some TVs / monitors and your phone becomes the remote control!  I only tried the iphone interface and it works great!This is an interesting platform and can breath life int a non-Internet connected TV!  I hope that weather / news apps will evolve for this platform!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J Prince"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Chromecast and as more apps become available for it it becomes that much more useful..

I had no functionality wifi or any issues at all with it.Took me less that 5 minutes to set up and I was streaming Netflix.  My 3 year crappy Roku would not work anymore - so I bought this for streaming NetFlix -plus you tube as Roku took away any and all you tube apps years ago.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Quad Net"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to use.
