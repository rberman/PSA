We were able to cancel all of the extras on our cable package and get everything we need with this. I was skeptical at first bc aside from the free prime movies we still needed to have a subscription to Netflix. Well, that's not needed to use the fire stick but it gives you more options. And it makes Netflix better by streaming through the tv. Only gave a 4 star review bc the set up was confusing. There was no where to put in your password through the remote with the tv in order to connect to our prime account. Even though it was already supposed to be linked. I had to call customer service to get it figured out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nicole"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great purchase if you are a prime member", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome little toy...have one for all my kids and their TVs and even bought a few for my brothers and sisters.Allows easy access to apps like Netflix and HBO Go.
