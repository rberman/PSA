[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Great product by the interface could be improved.  You really can't customize it yourself.  If you watch a lot of one app it'll automatically put in Home directly.  It's really responsive but the interface could freeze for a sec but there's no freezing when actually playing a movie.  I noticed unlike my Roku 3 Netflix will take about 15-20 seconds when you first play to go to HD.  These two issues can be overclock when you consider how cheap the price is.  I would get this over the regular Amazon Fire or Roku 3 because of the price.  I was able to get over any small issues with it.  With new firmware coming out it can only improve it.David", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "davidst95"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Incredible value.

Scrolling through a long line of available titles is a waste of time; there should be a virtual keyboard on which to type a title you're interested in. And buffering... what a mess. There may be a way around it, but with no instructions, I have no idea what it is. I will give HIGH MARKS to their \"Help\" people, though. I clicked \"CALL ME NOW\", and they did. NEXT DAY. I just went back into my email and found a User's Guide. Haven't read through all of it yet, but maybe the answers to the buffering issue are there. At least I can no longer complain about no instructions... red faced about blasting Amazon about this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bob from Tennessee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great Product!
