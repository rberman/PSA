I like the way it classifies the content and shows the art.  The interface flows well, much better than the native browser interface.  My problem is that the wi-fi adapter or the integrated player must be of a very low quality because I couldn't get enough bandwidth to stream anything and it wouldn't adapt to a lower profile/bit rate to get the content to flow.  I have both wired (W7 and W8 PCs) and wireless devices (iPad, iPhone, and Surface), all of which have no problem streaming Amazon Prime content.I returned the stick.
