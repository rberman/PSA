I got it at a discount so I figured I'd buy it. The one thing I hoped it would do, was to mirror my phone which was playing movies from my WD \"MyCloud\" over 100 miles away. Receiving data wireless from my MyCloud to my phone then to my phone to the Fire Stick was to much data to transfer. The movie would buffer alot and just wasn't worth it. However mirroring your phone itself is easy (at least with Android in my case). If you want to show pictures and play video content from your phone itself, it does a marvelous job! The only other thing I used was Netflix and that worked very smoothly. Other than that I haven't explored the Fire Stick's full potential. Great buy for the price!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Garrett"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing product so so so so happy", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Anthony m."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was super easy to set up and start using, and the remote makes it super easy to use.
