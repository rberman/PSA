I've tried Netflix (worked on 1 of 13 shows I tried), I've tried Hulu: max it worked was for 2 min per episode. Doesn't say it would work on abc, nbc, fox, but just to be clear it doesn't work on any of those either. My internet signal is incredibly strong. I can stream without any issues for viewing on my computer. I wish I could go back in time & decide not to purchase as this has caused more angst than it was worth.I'd love for this to work, but it would need some significant improvements before I would try again", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "JFerr2014"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kellen Snell"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Cumbersome setup, had to change settings in my router for my phone to connect.
