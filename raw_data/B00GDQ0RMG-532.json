The Fire TV Stick is much faster than the Roku and offers more apps/games, although the channel line up is similar. The Fire Stick allows only a WiFi connection (both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) but requires a physical power connection.Our first attempts at streaming movies were disappointing. While the picture and sound quality were both good, there were multiple buffering interruptions. I configured my router to assign a static IP address to the Fire Stick, enabled QOS, and set aside download bandwidth for the Fire Stick. My initial bandwidth allocations offered some improvement, so I kept adjusting until I got to 8192K (half my available bandwidth at the time). However, movies were still buffering. Finally I figured out that I had to allocate upload bandwidth as well; when I allocated 768K the buffering stopped. At that point I lowered the download allocation to 6144K with no loss of performance.Downloading the Fire TV app to my iPhone provided a spare remote for the Fire Stick, with the added feature of voice search. However, the phone is not responsive enough to use as a remote when playing a game.For a great price, great variety, and great performance, I give the Fire TV Stick five stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Darryl P.

It worked great out of the box and was easy to set up. Added a few apps that fit my needs. We have a more expensive media streaming box that we love and this surpasses that box. Best of all it was 1/3 the price. It does have one short coming. It tends to drop the wifi connection more than I would like. Using the jumper extension and mounting the stick vertically helped. The wifi is a strong signal and is only 4 feet away. Read a lot of complaints about this problem. Hopefully it will be addressed in a future software update. Otherwise I love it. Would like getting another or two for my daughters.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the device.

Nothing major, just seems to get overloaded. Perhaps I should have chose the larger Fire TV if I was going to download a bunch of Apps. But overall I am pretty happy with it. For $39...buy one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "HHOMedia"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "i do not usually write reviews but I have to on this. I bought this during the Prime Day sale as I needed a streaming device in my bedroom. I have an Apple TV in my living room and have for several years now without any problems but the Fire Stick is nothing but a problem. It continually says that it can not find my network or the signal strength is weak even though it's a 15ft straight shot with no walls blocking from my router. Then it will play for 5 seconds then buffer or drop the signal all together. I pull up speed test on my phone or iPad in the same room and I am getting between 30 and 50 Mbps download speed. If you have more patience for this than I do then this is the product for you. If you are like me a just want to watch a show before bed without resorting routers and modems and the stick itself trying to get it to stream, then spend your money some other place.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tyler Robert Oldaker"}]
