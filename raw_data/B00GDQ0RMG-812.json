It blamed the speed of my computer, which doesn't seem to be a problem when I run Netflix through my blu-ray player.  So maybe order the box and see if it will be able to do a better job finding my computer signal.  But I will probably just skip it and wait to buy a TV that has Amazon capability.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James D.
