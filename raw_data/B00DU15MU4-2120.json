I was able to actually see and play with Amazon Fire TV because my neighbor just bought one, I was glad I did because I was going to end up returning the Fire TV.It is as good or better than any other TV box out there for streaming.The bad,-It is only 8gb memory and 2gb are already used. If you like games, your library of games will not be very long as you can probably stored 4-6 good games on it and will have to delete games if you want to install a new one.-I have a huge library of TV shows and Movies stored on my 3tb external hard drive, the USB port is no open so I can't access my library. This was the biggest problem I found, if the USB port was open, that would allowed me to have more memory and access my files through the external hard drive or maybe through a USB drive.When they open the USB drive, I will definitely give it a go, until then I will continue using my old TV Box.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "cmagdy119"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Get to see all the movies I missed working and raising kids.

Well personally I think there are two improvements that could be added that would make a world of difference to the fire TV. I have over 400 movies and TV shows that I have ordered over time with Amazon when they are on sale.  It is very time consuming when I want to watch a movie I have to scroll through all of them because there is no possible way that I can remember all the titles I own.So My suggestions are as follows: If possible find a way that we can store the movies inalphabetical order. Also it would be very helpful to have two separate rows one for Movies and a lower row for TV shows.  Roku has this available and it makes finding your TV series purchases much easier to find. Other than those two suggestion I think the Amazon Fire TV is really great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Donna Pendleton"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very fast and smooth", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Grant S."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic.

I like the interface and the voice search. It is the best Amazon Instant Video interface I have encountered. Some have complained that it's too easy to order shows, or movies, that are not free on Amazon Prime. This is not the case. All Prime videos have the little Prime ribbon in the upper left corner that they have on display in every interface.I would rate the unit higher, if it weren't for the remote control. It's bluetooth and, apparently, does not know how to go to sleep. This means that battery life is beyond pathetic. If I do not disconnect the batteries after use and replace before use, a new set of batteries will be drained in under 2 days. Amazon has declined to comment in writing on this. Upon seeking some information from Tech Support, I was instructed to call to work through the problem. Fair enough. Except the problem requires addition of a power switch for the remote (!). Perhaps a \"permanent\" rechargeable battery and charging station. Not something you can fix over the phone.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "J. Harring"}]
