I decided to spend the $35 in hopes that wouldn't happen with Chromecast.  WOW is all I have to say.  It works flawlessly.  Simple set up, easy to use.  It showed up as an option for all my other connected devices (iPad, iPhone).  This was well worth the money.  Note - it doesn't work with Amazon instant video, unless you 'cast' from a tab in Chrome but that's not ideal.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Karen In PA"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I prefer the apple tv.

I have spent about 8 hours so far trying to install, and get this thing to work with very little success. Even after following all the instructions, reseting the router to factory defaults, following every troubleshooting tip, visiting the message boards, and shorting my life by several hours, I still do not have a functioning Chromecast. It appears as if it's installed correctly (network connection shows up in the lower left corner of the screen). However, I cannot \"cast\" video to it. No devices show up in the cast window. Search the internet for \"Chromecast problems\" before you buy. You may get lucky if you buy one, but I wasn't so fortunate.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Gregory A. Helton"}]
