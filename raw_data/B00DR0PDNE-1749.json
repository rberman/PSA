It comes with a USB cord because apparently the HDMI port can't power the chromecast or something? I don't know. So anyway you need to have a USB port on your TV or else you'd have to plug it into the wall. Not a big deal. However, the streaming is such bad quality that it makes it nearly impossible to watch without having to fidget with your computer. Youtube, Netflix, whatever... None of them work well. There are constant interruptions in the connection, or sometimes it just randomly disconnects and I have to reconnect it only for it to happen again 10 minutes later. It's a fun concept on paper, but doesn't translate well. My recommendation is to just save your $30 and hook up your computer directly with an HDMI. No interruptions, no disconnects, no lag, and it's so much cheaper. And for you people who want to cast directly from your smartphone, get one of those big ass android phones.

Using this with Hulu plus and Netflix enabled me to turn off my regular cable subscription, save about $1,000 per year and still deliver everything my family wants to see (any more).It does require people to be a little more tech savvy.  Setup was easy but using the apps (Netflix, Hulu, Chrome browser etc.) takes some getting used to and so I wouldn't recommend it for older people or people that are technically challenged.
