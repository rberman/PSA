The streaming is not always seamless. I'm often unable to pause what I'm watching and have to restart the app and even have to turn off the TV at times in order to regain connectivity and not lose my place.

I wish it had some native apps (mainly Google apps) so I wouldn't need to cast everything, but that is only a minor inconvenience. I find that I prefer a set top box with a GUI for most streaming, but for Google Play Music I find the Chromecast to be fantastic. I use my Chromecast 90% of the time for streaming music.
