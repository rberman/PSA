I wish the remote was backlit. I also wish there was an off button- the manual states it goes to sleep by itself after 30 minutes, you can manually put it to sleep (which means flipping through the menu to get to settings), or you can turn it off by unplugging it. Its not a big deal mind you, but I'm just in the habit of turning things off when not in use.At $20 (the special price) I wish I got 2 or 3. At $40? still worth it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "OK for what it is,  not as much content as the Roku or the Blue-ray players.

Not very convenient if your set is wall mounted as ours is.  Web site does not show any wire going to the doggle, just insinuates you plug it into the TV and your ready to go.  Other products out there get power directly from the TV hdmi port.  In my opinion this items description is purposely misleading.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "David L.
