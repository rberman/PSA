The Fire stick is always on, you simply change the input on your TV to access it. I don't have the best internet service but I haven't experienced any kind of crashes or failures yet and the picture quality has been great, for the most part.  The remote is very responsive and simple to use. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars yet is because the lack of a few Apps. Don't get me wrong, all the biggies are there and they add new stuff all the time. I'm just waiting for them to have Starz play. Add that and I'll add that final star!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brian J.
