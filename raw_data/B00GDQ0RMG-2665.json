Remote would not index one space on keyboard for each click.  Instead it was entirely random with the cursor going wherever it wanted on the keyboard.  Called tech support.  Tech support sent out new remote.  New remote would not pair up with fire tv stick.  Tech support would not authorize sending a new fire stick unless it was properly paired with the wifi network.  Tech support wanted me to disable network password to attempt to pair with stick so that no password would have to be entered.  I did not want to disable the password.  Tech support still refused to send a new tv stick even if I sent back the defective one.  Therefore, I asked for my money back and tech support said they would email me a return lable and authorization and a full refund would be processed when they received the fire tv stick.  That was ok by me.  Certainly not worth all this hassle for something that is supposed to be \"plug and play\".", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thomas A.
