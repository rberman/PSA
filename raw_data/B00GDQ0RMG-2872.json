It drops my wifi connection periodically and the signal strength should be excellent as the router is very close. Also it doesn't have the kids app \"Free time\" on it like my fire tv does. Since I bought this for my daughters room, that was really what I thought to be a buying feature and since it was on the fire tv and our kindle I thought for sure it would be on the stick. She got very familiar with how to navigate through free time on the fire tv and kinde so this has been a pain for her to try to use, and a pain for me to have to keep tring to teach her how to navigate the menus to find kid friendly programming.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Drebeesie"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Slow processing speed.
