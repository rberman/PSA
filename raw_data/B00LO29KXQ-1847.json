I prefer it over the Chromecast because, at the same price-point, this device has a remote and does not need an Android phone or tablet to work.The main issue for me is that the screen mirroring from Android devices (what you would use to look at photos/videos directly from your phone) does not work as reliably as in the Chromecast. It gets disconnected often and cannot really stream HD video.I would like to see native DLNA/AirPlay support to stream audio from my phone (currently this is an option only through a paid app).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "pabloi"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Needs to add more features!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jason"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I Love", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "abel rodriguez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "easy to set up. great  product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anne"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Often everything money", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "abubaker"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "THe remote controll is so easy to use!
