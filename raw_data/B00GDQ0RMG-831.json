I had a hell of a hard time setting it up, and determined a few things: it's wifi reception is not as good as the Chromecast or the Roku LT, and it does not play as good as either of those devices. It is so weak, that it constantly lagged and crashed. Didn't get any real help from Amazon tech. Just got done with a guy who's going to tell me that I cannot play Kodi/XBMC on my device, and he tried to remove it. Apparently they have the ability to see what we have on our devices, and can decide to remove what they do not like. I am very resentful of this practice. The device is not as good as any of the competition. A Roku runs rings around it as for stability and programming. As mentioned, it is not as sound technically as Chromecast. I know this because I have two Chromecasts and two Roku devices. It's only saving grace is because it runs  Kodi/XBMC, otherwise it's very tech limited.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "komboa"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "As advertised.
