Recently I became  obsessed with a show on Netflix, and binged watched the 4 seasons out to prepare for the upcoming 5th season. The only issue was I was tying up the gaming console 24/7 to watch my new favorite show! With the Fire Stick, I can watch any of my favorites on Netflix or Amazon Instant Video while my hubby can play his games on his Playstation 4! So excited to have something so easy to use. The remote is so sleek and easy to use as well.  Again - I love the Amazon Fire Stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Danielle Thompson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's very good\uff01", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dandan1225_2007"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome entertainment device..
