The USB device with the HDMI input and power connector made the unit hard to stay in place in my vertical HDMI input on my TV, because of it's weight. I was having to re-plug the device back into my TV set. The unit was always buffering due to the loss of a signal or the picture looked like it had snow on it. I had to return this product to Amazon; they refunded my money almost immediately. I purchased the more expensive Amazon Fire TV Device with the voice activated remote control, and I could not be more pleased the performance of this unit. The video and audio reception is superb, and the voice activated remote control is very handy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Drumboy26 \"Drumboy26\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fast and easy to set up.
