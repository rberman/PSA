The HDMI extension cable (about 4 inches long) is a nice accessory, makes cramped port locations on the TV a non-issue. - Issue ... on startup - UI balks at the connected power supply stating I need to use the one included.  EVEN when using that one! - Issue ... the channel line up needs to be enhanced.  Partially that is my fault for choosing the FireStick over the Roku. - Issue ... the Stick doesn't just stop after the current episode.  It will play all the episodes from a given show successively.I tried to cancel the order before it shipped.  But evidently the product was probably already packed for shipment.  The device shipped later that day.For my purpose ... I think the Roku (2 or 3) would have been a better choice.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
