[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "From the beginning (I've had this now for about 6 months) the remote would disconnect from the player so I would have to reset almost every time I used it.  That shouldn't be but I use the app and that works fine.  The biggest issue I have is the constant loss of connection which leads to crashes and freezing on an average of 4 times per viewing.  I have the roku 2 and never had an issue with either the remote or device.  I'm so mad I wasted money on this as I could have just bought another Roku2.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "teresa"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "poor WiFi range", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John A.
