Not worth it if you have a Smart TV. Only tried because I was offered a free demo from Amazon.Didn't like that they pre load your account to the device. Can't use without Prime Membership or pay $3.99 to watch Tv episodes that i can view online for free.Only good thing about this item was the remote worked very well. But I only found this out because I search through the endless categories to try and find some free videos to see how well the video looked. But I couldn't find one. The search features be need massive improvement, filter settings, sort, etc.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Brian Cote"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Gets most of the popular streams.
