However, the video is extremely laggy and jumpy. Videos also sometimes lag out and return to the menu screen unexpectedly. It definitely is the product and not my internet, either--I replaced the Fire Stick with an Apple TV and have had absolutely no problems since. Shame, since I was avoiding the Apple TV due to the cost and thought the Fire Stick would be a great deal but it ended up being a terrible product. I could never get through even a 30 minute show without it having some type of issue.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Xuan Do"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great streaming device!!!!
