I can say that my family has used the Fire TV stick alot since we got it a few weeks ago.  Everything has exceeded my expectations say for one are with this device.  It is responsive and as a frequest Amazon user, I found the interface very familiar and easy to use.  If you are an Android user, using and navigating through the Fire TV Stick should be second nature.  My only detraction from the awesomeness of the TV stick would be WiFi related.  I have a pretty fast internet connection, but I also have multiple household users using the singular connection. So between multiple tablets, smart phones and laptops, my connection can sometime get bogged down.  When it does however, the TV stick only seems to give one error message and forces you to either power down/up the stick (by unplugging the power source) or going under the TV Stick settings and making the Stick forget your network and reprogram it.  Though it doesnt take long to go either route, it can be very inconvenient.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Disappointed One"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this product!!
