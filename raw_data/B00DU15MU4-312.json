I bought it because I'm already a Prime member and I loved the idea of having access to my music from my TV. It's super easy to install and had many app options to download which I only downloaded the most common ones. The ones that I've been enjoying the most is HBO and Showtime. The only hiccup I had and it was more of a cloud syncing problem was that I couldn't hear music from any device but their customer service was so helpfully and efficient. They fixed it and had no problems since.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"behappy\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chad Hawkins"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy with it and all the perks that go along with it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "William H.
