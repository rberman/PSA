It worked fine but after 3 month of use it needed to bbe reinstalled every time I wanted to use it. Finally it gave up and turned into a small useless piece of electronics. It turns very hot when you touch it after it is connected to power for a while. It is not even able to connect to network. It is $38 down the drain. Very disappointed......The same thing happen to my father in law's chromecast....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Salman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works well, arrived soon too", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "carol bvindi"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Ok", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "marik"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I didn't have much luck with it.
