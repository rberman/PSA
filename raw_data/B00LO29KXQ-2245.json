Believe it or not, having this alongside a ChromeCast gives you more choices due to Amazon Prime Instant Video. I've been able to watch some series on here, others on Netflix...etc. It's quick, has a nice interface, and the fast forward / rewind feature is very useful and intuitive. We have 2 of these in our house now, and it's also perfect to quickly stream Thomas the Train for my son to keep him happy!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "jabdigital"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works as well at the Fire TV, although the response time is a bit slower (as expected).  Great low-cost option for Kodi, side-loaded.  Does require the power cord connect in order to work on my TV (Visio).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "R.
