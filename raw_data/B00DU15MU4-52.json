[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great addition to a home entertainment system (especially if you have Amazon Prime). I am not a huge fan of the main menu but the fact that the Fire TV allows you to side-load apps such as firestarter (a new menu system) I will give it 5 stars.  I give Amazon a lot of credit allowing there users to side-load apps giving the user options outside of the Amazon app store.With the Fire TV I purchased these with the Amazon Game Controller and have been very happy with it.  I have played several Android and emulator games on my Fire TV and really like the feel.  I have purchased three of these so far and would suggest these to a friend.My only note to Amazon is I think they should put Kodi (media center) back on the app store.  It seems they are eliminating the competition by removing it and I don\u2019t think that is fair.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DJohnson"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I would have give 5 stars if has Web browser capabilities. It kind of freeze every once in a while. I thought it would perform better than the fire stick but it is not. The only advantage of fire tv to stick is the voice search. But have no use for the voice search.  Therefore, I would prefer the stick. It is more economical sense.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Nathan Vue"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "WOW!!!!  I Love this device and I've only had it for a day. I have read some of the reviews that gave it 1 or 2 stars. The only reason I can possibly imagine anyone giving this less than five stars is that they haven't hooked it up yet. I read about having to wait for an update immediately upon hooking it up. That may have been true earlier, but not my experience, it started up at once, and performed as advertised. I'm blown away. The capabilities of this little box are amazing.I've read the reviews complaining about the lack of free content, and I have to disagree. I too would like to see more free PRIME, but, hey, where you gonna get what's available for the price of your PRIME membership anywhere else?If I had any complaints, it would be the free series available, but usually not all of the seasons. I really hate getting in to a series and then find out I have to pay if I want to watch the last season.My advice, BUY IT!!!  It's amazing.  I can't write any more about it right now, because this is holding me up from watching TV with my AMAZON FIRE. I feel the addiction starting already.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "G.Rice"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The fireTv Is good but could be better. App sometimes would crash or would not run properly, example: Netflix.

When I went to Netflix or Amazon for a movie I could not get closed caption even though I have it on my TV.  So a friend suggested to buy Amazon Fire TV.  Now I can have closed caption with the movie.  Just wished it would work with my blue tooth device.  I have hearing aids and they are not enough.
