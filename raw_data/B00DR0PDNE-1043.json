I have to spend 30 minutes getting it recognized again.  This happens about twice a week.  It requires me to reboot my desktop, reboot my router, reboot the chromecast, and then more times than not, I have to factory reset my router and re-congifure the router and setup the chromecast in order to watch what I want to watch.It is beyond frustrating and I am sick of it.  I have sent numerous emails to google support for this, but they have no responded to any of them.
