[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Let me start by saying I have used the Chromecast for about 20 minutes so far. I have spent all day, upwards of 6 hours trying to get it working.The setup initially appears to be real easy and straight forward. Once I got things working the setup really was easy. It was the time in-between that was not pleasant.The error message I got initially was that the Chromecast could not be found on the network. Researching only and calling Google direct this is an issue with router settings. The precise settings are either the uPnp, AP wireless mode, or the guest mode settings. All of these setting were set correctly for my router, or so I thought.No matter how many times I tried to reset my router and redo my setting, un-click and re-click, reboot and restart everything, the Chromecast would not connect. After more research I noticed an update to my router firmware and tried to do the update. The router gave me an error constantly saying that the firmware file was not compatible - yet it was the file downloaded by the built-in auto updater!So after much more research I tried to downgrade the firmware to an older version, because as it turns out the version I had was pulled from the manufacturers website at some point for having a lot of issues. Its amazing my internet worked at all. Trying to down grade offered the same error message that it was not a compatible file. Again more research and I find there is another way to downgrade. I had to reset the router, directly connect to port 1 using a specific IP address, do a special acrobatic combination of pressing buttons and the reset button. Eventually after about an hour of getting the process down correctly, I was able to hit the update button and within two minutes the router came back to life.Logging into the router proved that the firmware had been downgraded. At this point I upgraded to the newest firmware and things were still going great. I reset all the wireless setting to match what they were, redid the port forwarding, and setting the static IP addresses for various devices.At this point I was really hoping the Chromecast would work and if it didn't I was going to return it. Well I ran the setup and this time it very quickly connected, updated, and was done. My Moto G instantly recognized it and started casting without any extra software. Same with my wife's phone. I got a plugin for Chrome and that also works.Casting the browser on my laptop was a bit laggy but it works. Pandora, Youtube, and Netflix work really smartly. Even the phones volume buttons control the TV volume. My wife instantly took to it since shes the one who watches TV the most.Then it happened. The Chromecast just shut off.  I assume the TV's USB port has power saving and shut off. So I just plugged the Chromecast into the wall and it hasn't happened since.The router I used is a Netgear N600 wndr3700v2", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jim Raynor \"Vaio CW guy\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I do not want Google Chrome on my computer, this product will do just that.  I feel it is dishonest to have add ons in the computer word.  Want a free program, but they have add ons.  Is there no end to their greed, this goes for most of the companies out there?  Down load the app, the add on is Google Chrome.  My kid likes Chrome, I do not want it.  It may be a great program but it is how they put their product on my machine that bothers me.  This maybe a great product for a Google Chrome user.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Hollis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Extremely easy to use.
