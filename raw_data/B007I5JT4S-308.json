That it can stream from other sources is nice but I already have lots of devices that can do it as well... well, it turns out not \"as well\", but \"too\" More on that later.Setup was laughably easy.  I plugged it in, turned it on, waited less than a minute, and it displayed a message on the screen that I should tap it with my iPhone.  I wasn't sure why but I always do what technology tells me to so tap I did.  Apparently there is some magic where the tap transferrs details about my home network because a few seconds later the Apple TV was connected to my home wireless system!  No remembering WEP names or WPA2 keys or even if I'm using WEP or WPA.  Just a tap and I was done!  (BTW, *nobody* should be using WEP as just about anyone can crack in in less than a day.)Sending my iPad screen to the projector just started to work.  I select Airplay on the home screen and whatever is on my screen is also on my... screen.  I couldn't ask for more.As for the stuff it does that is the \"same\" as Roku and every DVD player and video game made in the past several years; this provides the clearest, most responsive, and user frientliest interface I've seen.  Too bad it doesn't stream Amazon content.  \"Why can't we all just get along?\"Because of the way Amazon reviews are displayed I doubt anyone will get a chance to see this before it gets buried under a ton more of what I expect will be equally glowing praises.  If you do find it helpful I hope you will fine a way to let me and Amazon know.  More importantly, unless the Amazon content thing is a show stopper or you really like having a wireless headset built into your remote, then I think Apple TV is wll worth your consideration when trying to decide on a media streaming device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "11/11", "author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\""}]
