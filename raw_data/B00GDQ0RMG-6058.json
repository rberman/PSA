It is fast, easy to use and intuitive. Accessing amazon content and renting movies is a breeze (Remember when we had to go to blockbuster). My Only complaint is the lack of a VUDU app and a Google Play app. I prefer to buy movies that come with the digital copy. I ALWAYS choose amazon, or use ultraviolet with VUDU. Unfortunately the only movies I seem to be able to add to amazon is Disney. I hope they add vudu soon. I am considering switching to the Apple TV now that the price dropped to $69. I can just use airplay to watch Amazon and Vudu.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "A. Brancheau"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The Stick is a bandwidth horder.

No AV receiver support? C'mon Amazon, I'm a hardcore Prime user and thought this would be the best way to enjoy Prime content.I took my Chromecast out of my Denon AV receiver and plugged in my new fire stick and it just won't display.I pluged in this POS into a TV directly and was able to connect right away.Does anyone just use a TV in the living room anymore? How about surround sound? I am switching back to Chromecast and will make sure I don't recommend it to anyone (I'm an IT guy).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Kevin-Kay"}]
