Super-simple to setup, and works perfectly with my Amazon Prime Video subscription.

Prior to this I had to stream through my Wii Nintendo system\u2026 Which sucked)\u2022 I like the remote, more than the Apple TV one. It just has more \u201cfeel\u201c to it\u2022 Lots of fun games included (little app type games that are just free and fun for short time)\u2022 Really easy to set up\u2026 I plugged in\u2026 linked it with my Wi-Fi and I was good to goOverall:It\u2019s funny\u2026 Every single company comes out with their own device. At this point, I have the Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Roku, and now The Amazon Fire Stick. I wish there was just one universal device to control everything and sync everything together\u2026 Of course that\u2019s the dream of  today\u2026which I doubt will happen anytime soon. As for the device itself, it\u2019s really no better or worse than everything I just listed. It\u2019s better for me in terms of prime movies because it makes it easy to stream these to my television\u2026 Very similar to how my Apple TV makes it easy to watch all the movies I have downloaded on iTunes. So all in all, I am happy with the fire stick and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is a prime member.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AlmostEverything84"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This thing was a bit of a pain to set up.
