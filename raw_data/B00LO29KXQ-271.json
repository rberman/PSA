This goes back to old linux version of plesk and FrontRow on the Mac Mini. I've given up on the DIY solution as it's not practical for non-IT members of the family. :)I settled on the Google TV systems, but every time I found one I liked, the hardware company would go out of business. I then went to Apple TV, and that seemed to be ok, but the streaming was really weak and the lack of support for Amazon Prime made it really tough to make it a good solution. Chromecast was about the same.I bought the Amazon Fire stick with pretty low expectations. Very quickly, I was blown away. This thing is perfect.
