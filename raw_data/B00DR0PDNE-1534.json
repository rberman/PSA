It gave us some trouble to setup a few times when it should just be easy but i credit that to my Belkin N150 dated router. sometimes i have to reset the router (quite frequently on first connection of the session between cast and device) but thats the only complaint. thanks", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "michael"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Easy to setup.
