[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really like the fire stick. It's responsiveness is amazing. I have a smart TV but the software on in is not up to par. To have a smart TV and still choose the fire stick tells you a lot about the work that's been put in to making this item. It's even easy for my 4 year old to maneuver and you don't have this gigantic control with a thousand buttons that he wouldn't be able to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rafael Barba"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I like everything about the stick except for the fact that it has to be plugged in to work.
