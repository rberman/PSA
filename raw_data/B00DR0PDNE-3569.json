Currently music and movies have to be thru Google\u00a0Play but not on the device - only uploaded or purchased.  It's a start.  Also works well with youtube apps on my iPad, my Nexus 7 and my Droid phone.  Tried working with Chrome browser with some success but much more trouble.  Not really worth pursuing yet.  I'm sure they will get it there.If you are a heavy Play purchaser or upload your music to google play it allows you to send the audio and video through the TV or amplifier.
