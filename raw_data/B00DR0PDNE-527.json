They do have their faults, however.  Both of my devices will periodically stop responding, requiring me to unplug and reboot the device. If it were just one, I'd be willing to call it a fluke, but both of them do it.  Second, the Chromecast has very specific requirements for audio/video that a lot of non-technical people will not understand.  This kind of understanding is necessary if you want to do things like run a media server and stream through them.  The webcasting extension which allows you to cast anything you can play in a web browser is a good idea, but its buggy.  At first, I though the lack of a remote control was a good thing, since I could just control it from my phone, saving remote clutter, but I quickly got annoyed at having to pick up my phone, unlocking the screen and navigating to the app just to pause playback.  Where the device really shines is with apps specifically optimized to work with it, such as Netflix.  As a generic streamer, I think you'd do better with Roku, but if you use only apps that are optimized for Chromecast, you're experience will be a good one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Dave"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "What else can be said?

My Chromecast has proven to be unreliable.  The connection to the Chromecast is lost regularly, and nothing you can do will get it back. It will just start working again randomly in a couple days, but drop off for no apparent reason. It appears this product is not quite ready for \"prime time\".
