It only has a select list of movies and TV shows selected by Amazon.  Clunky user interface.  It can't browse the web.  You're much better off just connecting your laptop directly to your TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Law Prof"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just as good as amazon fire tv box.
