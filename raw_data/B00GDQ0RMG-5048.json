I wasted 2 hours before I read the small print, and realized you need a wireless connection... WIRED won't do. So don't order if you are like me, and think Amazon is honest, wireless should be in the name, and not in the description.I first thought it was a USB stick... my bad...then when it was hdmi stick, then I went to hook up to the TV, and found out it needed a wireless connection, so then I checked Amazon and found that they said I needed a wireless connection.SO I'M telling this to AMAZON, you need to call it Wireless FireTVStick", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "2rain"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I absolutely LOVE my Fire TV Stick!!!
