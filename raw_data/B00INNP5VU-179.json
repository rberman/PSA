The one I had periodically stopped working and I had to reset it. Also its seems one time a button does a function one way and differently another time.  I suppose this could be operator error but there is not documentation to explain how it is supposed to work. The last thing is it has no on off switch. so even though your tv is off whatever you were watching could still be running. Of course  the ability to get content from so many services still made it worth the money  and I bought another one after the first one died", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.

It synced just fine with my wireless, but after that it kept freezing.  I never even got a chance to watch anything because the screen would just freeze for minutes at a time.  Maybe this is because the bedroom is the furthest room from the wifi?  Other stuff works though.  I returned and will try the more expensive unit that is not the USB.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Josh Moeller"}]
