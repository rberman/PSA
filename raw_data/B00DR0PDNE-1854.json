Have had it for about 4 months and have to say I love it. Works great when I want to cast something from my laptop or phone. Just select the network and tap the cast button. Was easy to set up and has since gotten a couple updates. You can even cast your computer screen so its like having a huge computer monitor!  For 35$, it beats out the Roku for sure!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. Brown"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Useless!  Already had a netflix player in my game console.

They are not super tech savvy but with just a little bit of coaching (and a little cheat sheet of instructions from me) my parents were able to watch YouTube and Netflix on their big, new TV without worrying about connecting their computer to it.
