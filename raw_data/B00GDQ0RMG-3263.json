Even as a electronically-challenged blonde, I was up and running, building my watchlist within 10 minutes of opening the package.My cable/internet bill was $190 a month.  By eliminating cable, and adding Hulu and Netflix accounts, I am now out only $67 per month and I still get local TV stations (thanks to my antenna) and all the TV and movies I want to see thanks to Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Netflix!

It keeps losing internet connection, while none of my other devices have that problem.  It mostly shows the low quality video, because its trying to cache the video.  It sits near my xbox, which has no internet connection or caching issues.  I got the Fire Stick, because the xbox, is slow and old... netflix takes about 3 minutes to load, but taking minutes to load is better than losing connection 2-3 times per movie.When it is working, it is useful to show my Prime movies and other amazon collections, plus its easy to have someone else log in to show their stuff.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aaron"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this thing.
