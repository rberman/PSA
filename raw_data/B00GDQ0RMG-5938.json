[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was a little disappointed in this stick once I actually got it up and running.My main issues is that they are advertising this the same way as the full blown Fire TV, including all the Game features, which was one of the reasons I picked them up during the initial half price sale they had for them.While it DOES do everything it advertises in terms of streaming movies and videos, it misses the marks when it comes to games.  A LOT of the games I tried to download from the Amazon app store just do NOT work on the stick.  Plus out of the ones I did manage to get downloaded, MOST required a game controller, and don't work with the remote.  Disappointing...So I did some research and found that a lot of people use the PS4 controller with their Fire TV units.  Turns out that the Fire TV Stick can see it, but it will not pair with it.  So the Fire TV 'will' pair with a lot of blue tooth controllers, but the Fire TV 'stick' will not. Shelling out $40 for an Amazon only controller, when I have a perfectly good controller already, just doesn't make sense.  Again, disappointing.They marketed this as BOTH a streaming device and game play device.  While it meets the hype for streaming, it fails when it comes to games.  So for now I have to give it 3 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Customer 2000"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I picked up a Fire Stick while Amazon had a pre-order sale for $19. I currently use a Roku XS and two Samsung smart tvs, so my comparison will be to those. I do not have an AppleTV, so I cannot compare to that.Setup:Initial setup was fairly painless. It walks you through the steps and gives you a quick tutorial. I chose not to use the included a/c adapter and instead opted for USB power (even though it kept telling me not to use USB). The included HDMI adapter makes it easy to install in virtually any TV.Features:Most apps that I tried (Netflix, Hulu+, Pandora, A&E;) worked fine. Speed seemed about on par with my Roku XS.I am using Amazon Cloud for my music and pictures and it immediately synced my photos, so they were there for viewing or a slideshow.The iOS app is not currently available, so I could not test mirroring, etc...Remote works great. Feels good in your hand and the buttons are not hard to find.Wifi connection is good. Connected to my 5GHz network and streaming Hulu+ with no stuttering.Good Amazon Prime integration if you've purchased digital content from Amazon or have a Watchlist going with Prime.I don't play games on my tv, so I did not test any games or the optional game controller.Cons:A little buggy the first couple of days. Sometimes apps would disappear or show unavailable. Seems to be resolved now.I was a little disappointed that I had to pay for the Plex app. This was free on the Roku.Conclusion:At $19 (I've seen it as low as $24 during Black Friday/Cyber Monday) this is a pretty good deal. If you have existing digital content with Amazon or multiple Amazon devices (Fire, Fire HD, etc...), then this is a good addition. If you don't, then there are other devices that give you the same benefit depending on how much you want to spend. Nothing blew me away about the Fire TV Stick, but then again I was not disappointed as I generally expect better quality from Amazon.If anything changes in the coming weeks, I'll post updates, but for now so far, so good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "T.

Now that I see all the cool things it can do I'm in love.  We never used to watch regular tv anyway, we always watched movies on prime or netflix, this stick makes it so much easier to stream our movies in different rooms.  We used to have to drag the Kindle or Xbox around to whatever tv we wanted to watch it on but with the stick we can move around and stream our movies where ever we want.  I'm buying one for my boyfriend because he loves to stream movies from his phone, now he can just carry on the fire TV stick.  I'm sure he'll love this as much as I do.I'm definitely getting the game controller in the near future.  Super excited to see what else this device has to offer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gemini25"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Overall, a really nice product, especially if you have Prime.  However, I purchased it during the promotion period for $20.  At the regular price point, I might consider spending a bit more for the Fire TV Box.I own both products.  They both take you to the same interface and provide the same selections and user experience.  For the casual user, the primary difference is the Remote Control.  The Stick remote is a nice feature, but it's not as nice as the remote that comes with the Fire TV Box.  It lacks the voice recognition/mic and just doesn't feel as solid. It's worth noting, however, that the Box remote does work with the Stick and can be purchased separately... but at that point, you may as well purchase the Box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sdbank"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I think the idea of it, a stick that is autonomous that you do not have to use another device with.  But in execution it seems that the hardware or software is not up to snuff.  It works most of the time but there are frequent freezes and hiccups in the video playback. That is usually a sign of low hardware resources but that is just my take on it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Donald Francis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect Amazon Prime companion. I can bring it along with me from home to hotel to a friend's house. Very convenient especially for a person who frequently travels. It is very portable, just the size of an old USB drive plus the remote. I can access all my Prime content with the device, either I watch movies or TV shows, or just listen to music or browse my photos.

I'm waiting for Crunchyroll and VuDu mainly, and if I don't see it soon I might have to switch to Chromecast.

Most hotels need you to login to their WiFi through a web browser. Since this this lacks even a basic web browser I can't use it on the roa . Which, let's be honest is most likely the primary use of this thing since its nice and compact. Works great otherwise. But sadly this thing is worthless to me pretty much. I got it for the $20 deal so I'm gonna hang onto it in the hopes amazon releases some sort of firmware patch. Unfortunately until then its gonna sit in the closet:/", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "shaun wilson"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It works well and looks nice, but a little buggy.  the most noticeable is.  when you are  looking through the apps.  some of the images are slow to come up. not a big selection of apps yet, but hopefully that will grow.  there is no SiriusXM. or HBO go.  I watched a movie and no issues with that.  also, you can purchase apps and movies easy like on computer, do not need to put in special codes like the blue ray player amazon apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I absolutely love the Fire TV Stick and the product itself receives 5 stars but there are a couple of issues that could be improved upon:There is no off button so I wasn't sure how to end a session on the Stick. I checked Amazon.com/devicesupport and found out that it is not necessary to unplug the device - you simply turn off your TV or change your (HDMI) channel. It would have been helpful to add this on the leaflet included with the Fire Stick.Also one cannot automatically listen to Amazon \"radio\". It's probably easy to do but I have not yet taken the time to find out how it is done. Seems to me it should have been included automatically. There's probably a good reason it's not - i.e. uses too many gigs or something.Would I buy it again? Yes, definitely. The first Stick was a great deal at the Prime introductory price but it is still worth the full $39 +/- price.***This is a footnote made almost two months after I bought my Stick. I've had a couple of months to use my Fire TV Stick and I still love this product. I particularly love to listen to my music through the Stick because I have a Bose sound system connected to my TV. The sound is phenomenal with lots of music choices in my cloud. It's helpful to create your own playlists in advance. I still haven't discovered a way to listen to Amazon radio (is someone knows, I'd love to hear back) but there are other alternatives, almost as good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "GranMajesty"}]
