No luck.  I thought the problem may have been with the Stick itself but when I plugged it into my PC monitor it came up running.  The thing is I bought it so I could use it on my Samsung TV.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.Will probably have to return the unit and get a Chrome Cast.UPDATE: After spending a few hours trying to get this to work on my Samsung TV and reading anything I could find online about how to fix \"Not supported mode\" I had to give up and returned the unit to Amazon.  Looking at other similar devices such as Chrome Cast and Roku they all seem to have one problem or other.  I think I'll wait some.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/5", "author": "JLM"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It is NOT Miracast Certified, and I have no idea how Amazon is getting away with continuing to advertise it us such despite knowing it is not. The stick will not most likely not Miracast if you are using a laptop (specifically Windows), technical support confirmed as such on the phone that it is not yet compatible for those devices. In fact a supervisor was pretty surprised to hear that there is still a big green check next to Miracast Compatibility. Extremely disappointing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Ben K"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am happy  with this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "jeff"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love my Fire stick and got it at a bargain - on sale", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer \"Kuban\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love the Amazon Fire Stick!
