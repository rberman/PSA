[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Ready for my sad tale?I ordered the Fire TV stick when it was $19 for Prime members in November. Took about a month or so to ship. Hooked it up right before Christmas and...it didn't work. Ok, it worked, but it would not keep a wifi signal for more thank 2 minutes before getting the \"check your settings\" notification. Tried playing with it for a bit and couldn't get it to function normally. Meanwhile, I have a minimum of seven other wifi connected devices in my home that all work without a hitch. It clearly wasn't my wifi network, it was the Fire TV stick.I went online to research the issue and found many, many other people having the same issue. I was really disappointed in Amazon for putting out a product that was so buggy.I put it back in the box and was prepared to return it just after the holiday.Around New Year's I decided to pull it out again and give it another try. The only thing I did differently this time was to hook it up via the HDMI dongle rather than directly into the HDMI port in my television. (I used the external power charger both times) Lo and behold, it held the wifi signal without a problem! I looked online and saw that a software update had happened in the meantime as well, so I'm not sure if it was the software update or the use of the dongle or some combination of the two, but now it works perfectly.I'm a long time Roku user and feel that the Roku's biggest strength is it's smooth and user-friendly UI, followed by the number of \"channels\" available. Fire TV pales in comparison on both counts. I'm sure the \"channel\" or \"app\" situation will improve, it's only a matter of time for things like that. But the UI is very clunky and not anywhere near as slick to navigate.Having said all that, I absolutely love the Fire TV stick. Why? In one word: speed. This thing is an incredibly fast streamer, faster by far than the Roku, even faster than watching something on my Macbook. Amazon content, as you may have heard, is incredibly nimble. From pressing play there's maybe a 1-2 second lag. Even Netflix and Youtube are quite zippy. And Netflix supports profiles on the Fire Tv, which is something the Roku still doesn't do.So if you're an Amazon Prime member in the market for a cheap, speedy streamer, you could do much worse than the Fire TV stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeremy H \"JRH\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Allows user to PURCHASE movies, TV shows, games, etc. The device works as advertised and expected.
