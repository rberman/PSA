Their support was great to work with from a customer support perspective.  I bought the Fire TV instead, it works from a network perspective but from a usability stand point it does not work well with my ISP.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael L Thompson"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "still not able to access anything.

It was easy to install and get started.  We noticed quickly that it buffered a little less than the WII did but it still buffered.  The picture quality is good, the apps and connections are many more than we need and had before. It would have been a 4 star review but, yesterday it just lost it's connection to the internet and wouldn't reconnect.  I was willing to work with the little bit of buffering but not reconnecting to the WIFI is a big deal.  I can't buy one for the kids TV because I can't trust it will put up with the demands they would put on it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MattRomney"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
