Heck, even if you pay more, you'll be hard pressed to find a better streaming media player than a Chromecast.  I have several PS3s, which we used to use to stream Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, etc., but the Chromecast is so much more seamless when changing between content providers and apps.  Add to that the growing number of apps that support Chromecast functionality, and there's really no good excuse to NOT have one of these in each TV you own that has an HDMI input.
