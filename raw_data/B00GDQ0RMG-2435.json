I have owned it since it came out. I don't mind the layout at all, bought it knowing it would be Amazon heavy. The problems I have are poor wifi reception, I can have it 4 feet from my router and it will say it has poor internet. I have a smart tv that it's connected to and when the stick continually buffers or doesn't work I watch on the tv app with no issues. Also the farther into a movie I get, the farther the sound looses sync with the video, doesn't seem to matter what app I'm watching, Amazon, Netflix, Hulu plus, ect.I was excited to get an email from Amazon telling me I could hook up bluetooth headphones, only to find out it was a mistake. I was hoping to connect my bluetooth speaker/headphones to see if it would fix my sync problem.The Fire stick seems to have it's software throttled as to not steal sales from the fire tv. To bad, I really would like the headphone connection.I would like it better than my roku and chromecast if not for these 2 problems that show up quite often, and the scaled back abilities.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "YnotMe"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love it and so does my son.
