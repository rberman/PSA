I have an Apple tv in the other room, and I'd have to say the Fire Stick remote and function is not as intuitive as the Apple tv. I was also a bit disappointed to find out some programming is only available to Android users. I have an HBO Go subscription but it's only accessible for those using an Android phone. I have an iPhone. Oh well. The Fire Stick is a nice bit of technology and a fun toy to have. I still give it 4 stars. Good job.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Planet77"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love no more cable bills", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Barbara Davis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We bought this instead of a Smart TV.

The only thing that would make it better was if it didn't need a power cable to run.  If it ran straight off the HDMI port, it would be the best product on the market by far!
