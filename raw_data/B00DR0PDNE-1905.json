[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "This is a great device hobbled by lack of software. Easy to use and great picture quality but ultimately it is really limited. It's especially sad and ironic that it's the #1 Best Seller in Electronics on Amazon, yet there's no Prime compatibility. I guess Amazon expects you to buy their Fire streaming device as well.

My TV automatically switches to the Chromecast input whenever we Cast something to it which is incredibly handy. The fact that the YouTube app on any device (iPhone, Windows Phone, Android, etc...) automatically is able to cast if someone is on your WiFi network (without downloading the Chromecast App on their phone) is INCREDIBLY handy. We love having people add to a House Party Que on YouTube for democratic music playing. :-) Watching a funny video on someone's phone at our house is prohibited, we just have them Caste it up to the Big Screen TV so everyone can enjoy it. Fantastic Tech device and I love the price for what it does.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ellis Benus"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wasn't sure about how things were going to work.
