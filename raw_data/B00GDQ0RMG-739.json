I was so excited to get rid of my cable and just use Netflix streaming and Hulu. Having a prime membership and being able to watch some stuff for free, ended up being an even bigger bonus. Add in the music for when I'm cleaning and the games my kids can play..LOVE it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tonya Tamm"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Quick and responsive", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Greg"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I like it, but there are quite a few things I was looking for that I thought would be on the gadget but weren't. Or at least I thought the gadget would allow for the download of some of those stuffs. I wish this either had a web browser or allows for it to be downloaded. I also wish, and would love to see it have the Udemy app, the Xfinity app, among others. This gadget would be perfect, I think, with those things available.

I chose this over the Google Chromecast because it allows me to use Amazon's Instant Video. However, although the setup and use is easy, I was disappointed in the false advertisement. We are \"supposed\" to be able to fling what is playing off our devices/tablets.. however the fling option is only available from Amazon devices. This was not disclosed in their sales pitch. It may be found in small fine print. I've tried contacting Amazon regarding this matter and all they could recommend was for me to speak with one of their technicians to troubleshoot, which I know is not the problem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Sherry"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "easy to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "T Fracisco"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am very pleased because I bought two more and will buy one more later.

I like the size of the remote and the fact that the unit does not take up a lot of room.  I use it for both NetFlix and Amazon Prime.  I particualrly like the fact that it connects with the HDMI stick which makes connection really easy.  A lot less wire than with Roku.
