Subscribed to SlingTv for $25/month and can watch enough TV to satisfy my needs. Streaming is very good with little hesitation. My WiFi is running at about 4000 Kb/s download speed. which is fast enough. The HD comes through on the TV fine.The Fire stick basically turns the TV into a giant ipad. Downloading apps is easy although the apps carry their own pros and cons. The remote is easy to use and reasonably intuitive. It takes a little practice like any device. It will be interesting to see how streaming advances in the future. I would love to see more live content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer \"DBee\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Awesome!
