Remote, clear menus, fairly smooth and fast performance, and nearly unlimited possibilities with its open Android interface, an app that allows your phone to double as a remote, the ability to sideload non-app store apps, and compatibility with any HDMI enabled device.The only cons at the moment is that it is somewhat buggy (for a new device, that is not at all unexpected).  Have had a few crashes and app hangs.  Also, at $39 it is a bit more expensive than the Chromecast, even though it is adding more functionality.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "D.

Most of the time it will not make a selection, many times it makes a delayed selection. Other times it makes rapid selections in succession. I downloaded a remote app for my cell phone and it works perfectly. After using the fire stick with the remote for a while, I may be able to anjoy the product. It seems that if I give the remote as command and slap it on the back, it will work for a short time, but I never know when it is going to dfail again.I have viewed the help videos. They do not address the issue of failure to function. i replaced the shipped Amazon batteries with fresh Duracells - no improveement.

Out of the box, the setup is a breeze and tutorial is helpful for first time users. My initial thoughts...The good: fast action interface, user friendly remote, and a fair amount of access to channels.The bad: I like the menus on Roku a little better but maybe with time the Fire TV menus will grow on me.The ugly: I'm a little disappointed there isn't an iOS app yet, but \"coming soon\" TBD.Overall, I think it's a pretty decent device for the $$, you can't beat the price tag. Great \"training wheels\" for first time users trying to step away from the leash of cable/satellite providers. I'd recommend the chromecast for easy streaming from phones/tablets and for a little more, a roku for more channels.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kevin D Vernon"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Cool device with several services in one place.But, it can't be powered from a TV USB port, It has to be plugged into a wall outlet.  Completely negates the point of the stick form factor.I have been using a Chromecast for many months now and hoped this would have been an upgrade with the higher spec internals and more available apps, but it's a big step backwards.I wanted to like it, but missing the simple task of just powering up as conveniently (and aesthetically for those with their TV's mounted on the wall with no visible cables) as the Chomecast or Roku stick is a instant deal breaker.This might end up in someone else's Christmas Stocking, or maybe just the bottom of my sock drawer, haven't decided yet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Jason Kent"}]
