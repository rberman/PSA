I'd like to see it be able to cast from the Chrome browser from the iPAD as it does from the PC. The cool thing is that the connection between the iPAD/PC and the television is all wireless, and I don't even have a smart TV, although, fortunately I had an HDMI port on the television, which is key.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "smiling.in.hicksville"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Was what I expected and arrived in full working order.

Less apps and things to choose from. Also..if your wifi is iffy and picks up another signal..it screws up this signal and disconnects.

Although I had just a bit of trouble at first (pilot error), I called Google and got a very quick response that solved my problems. I know there are other products that perform the same function but what excites me about Chromecast is that it is new and has a lot of promising developments to come I'm sure.

It's so easy to use.  The only issue I've had is that it must received a fully strong signal, or it wants to buffer.  Once that was resolved, it has worked flawlessly.
