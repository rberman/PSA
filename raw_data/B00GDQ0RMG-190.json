The only think I had to do was log in to my Hulu and Netflix accounts. I am looking forward to streaming my favorite shows and movies on my TV now!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kirstein Arpin"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It was delivered to the wrong address", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Elizabeth Osworth"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it, worth it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Happy in SC"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "we like it...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rick Ennis"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica Cortese"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product.

My smart tv works better without this device.  I only got it for HBO Now.  But, not sure it was worth it really.  Just makes watching anything on it, an act of futility.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "KC"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very fast and easy I like it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "gary l. gruber"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome.
