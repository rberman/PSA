I purchased the Fire TV Stick about a month ago and at first I really enjoyed it. After about two days whenever I would watch Netflix my show would stop completely and buffer for about 5 minutes before starting again. It would go back and forth between being HD and pixelated.The next day I tried to watch Netflix the device said that it could not connect to the wifi. That was two weeks ago. I tried unplugging it and plugging it in again, i even left it unplugged for several days. I tried using the extender cord and not even that worked. Today I finally called Amazon and spoke to someone on the tech team. Let me say again that I have never had any issues with Amazon ever but this had to be the worst experience. The tech associate that I spoke to first asked me if I unplugged the device and if I used the extender cord. I told her that I had tried everything manual and that I was well aware that sometimes people overlook the minor details. She then went on to ask me if I could reset my wifi and I told her that the connection on my cell phone and computer worked this fine.The entire time I could hear her flipping through a manual. I then asked her if I could speak with a Fire TV stick specialist and she told me that there was not one and that she was following protocol by asking me all of the questions in order to find out what was wrong. The final thing she asked me is if it were possible for me to unplug all devices in my household that used the wifi so I could allow the Fire TV stick to use the wifi. Extremely frustrated and let down, I told her that I would no longer be of service and that I wanted to return the Fire Stick. I could not believe that these were the questions used to troubleshoot the Fire Device. I will not be exchanging, but returning for a full refund. Another thing about the Fire Stick that I did not understand is that it advertised that you are able to stream HBO GO which is not true. I don't know if there is some sort of update that they do but I don't think they should advertise something that is not even an option yet. It is also advertised that all you need to do is plug it into your HDTV and go. Even the picture shows a woman putting it in her purse. You actually need to plug it into the wall (or power source) and it actually needs to stay here the entire time. I just feel like I was led on a little bit by this device. I mean $39 is a great deal, but I think I'm going to check out the roku or just pick up a blu ray player. Hope you have better luck than I did!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Meosha"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it! Easy to install. Lots to choose from.
