We're a couple in our 60's, and don't have some of the apps that other (younger) people have...Netflix, Roku, etc.  But we enjoy the Prime Movies for free and have found some really good ones that weren't in theaters.  Honestly, we don't watch a lot of movies, so this does the job for us and we're extremely pleased with it.  Set up was easy (even for a 63 year old woman).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scorpio3813"}]
