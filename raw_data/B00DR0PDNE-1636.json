On a computer it is only useful if you use Google Chrome browser - even then it is only one tab that seems to display at a time. Negative features.On tablets there are a very limited number of still developing programs that can stream video or allow you to view what is on the tablet screen on your TV. Some of the programs crash regularly.In a year or two this will be ready for sale to the general public.

I thought it would do as much as an AppleTV does for an iPhone/iPad, but it turns out you need 3rd party apps to stream photos and videos from your phone to the device, and they don't work reliably.  Why doesn't Google provide this natively?  Works ok with YouTube, Netflix, HBO Go, etc., but it seems like it is just redirecting the stream from the site instead of streaming from your phone or tablet (no Showtime Now and DishNetwork to name a few that work through other means).  I have a few other devices (game consoles, TVs, and Blu-ray players) that can basically do the same thing.  Streaming from a Chrome browser on a PC does not work with extensions like Silverlight and Flash and can be choppy unless you have a rock solid wifi connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "R.
