It works well as long as I disconnect the power AND the remove it from the TV after each use.  If I don't, I have been unable to reconnect to WIFI.  The Stick gets very hot, which Roku Support said is normal.  They advised that it should be unplugged after each use, but I found that I had to disconnect it from the power it AND take it out of the TV in order to get a connection.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Wayne"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy with delivery time and product, one of the easiest purchases I\u2019ve had on amazon.

Worked fine until now, where the hardware went bad and not receiving WiFi signals or connecting with remote. Contacted support who waste an hour of my life having me do the same troubleshooting steps over and over just to tell me that because the product was purchased before 4/9/2015 its only covered for 90days and mot 12 months. Why should a consumer trust a product that the company who makes it isn't confident enough in its durability to back for the first year of its useful life.
