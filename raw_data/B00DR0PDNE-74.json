I use a Roku, Fire TV would also be good. This is ONLY a mirror device which is the BEAST solution for PC to TV mirroring, and chrome tab casting. You can play any video to your TV which is awesome for the stuff unavailable on typical streaming devices, such as HBO Now (now on android). But, this is not as good for watching Netflix, hulu, etc. as you have to link your phone between casts which can cause lag between episodes, battery drain, etc.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tajanator \"Tajanator\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it use it all the time", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Martin"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Would not recommend", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "andre king"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the product - would love anything that hurts Comcast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Glenn England"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Make the USB part longer and the chord to plug it in longer!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Corey R"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "We are yet to watch a whole video -even a short one- without interruptions/disconnections =(", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "simultaneous \"simultaneous\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've liked it.
