[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got this and I have finally dumped cable! With my Netflix subscription, Amazon Prime membership, and a HD antenna, my family has access to all the programs and movies we need.  It is user friendly and the kids had no issues navigating it.  Looking to order one more for our TV upstairs.  Get this and take the plunge, dump Cable TV and save some money!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MRB"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I picked this up when it had the Prime promotion, for like $20. Great, great deal. We plugged it into our bedroom TV. Works just as great as our AppleTV in the living room. I just wish they'd push the iOS app out a little faster.

The menus start with only Amazon content and you have to scroll down quite a ways to get to non-Amazon content2. It has a very pretty screensaver3. Very little control over the systemFinally - Word to the wise...or those not so wise ;)According to their support desk, Amazon's Fire TV product's YouTube app does not play Google movies by design.  It works for EVERY other YouTube app, but they decided to make it \"incompatible\" on Amazon Fire TV devices.FYI, if you've bought blu-ray discs with 'digital content', you're often able to link those movies to iTunes or Google Play.  None of this content will be available via Amazon Fire TV.P.S. Hulu is frequently broken on the Fire Stick.  Video hangs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael J.

If you can change a light bulb you can get this working. And to save some money for the remote with voice search download the app on your smartphone and it has the voice feature. It does everything I expected it to do and so far there are no cons. Would recommend this for anybody who likes to stream as well as anyone who is a prime member.
