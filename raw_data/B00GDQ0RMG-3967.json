Range must be very poor.  When I am able to download a movie it only plays about half way through and then cuts out.  Nothing seems to help getting it back.I do give high marks to Amazon.  They have noticed the difficulties and credited my account for the cost of the movies that we didnot get to complete.  Thanks you amazon.

I cannot watch Netflix movies with it. Every time I try it says \"IDCP unauthorized. Content disabled.\" But I can hear the movie! When I first got it I could watch Netflix. Now I can't. Very disappointed Cannot watch Sho anytime either because Comcast will not authorize. All the Amazon Prime movies I can watch on my laptop, now I must pay to watch with the Fire TV Stick even though I'm signed into Amazon Prime and my watch list even come up on the TV screen.
