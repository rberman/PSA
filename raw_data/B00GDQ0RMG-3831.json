When I am not watching Prime and watching normal channels on Direct, my TV screen goes black for a few moments every few minutes.  The only way to stop this from happening is to unplug the Fire Stick every time we are done watching a Prime video.  This doesn't appear to be a big problem, except the TV it's plugged into is eight feet from the floor.  I don't want to have to go through that scenario every time.  I will be glad to change my rating when this problem is solved.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J.
