After spending much of 2 days on the phone with Amazon trying to get this thing to work they finally admitted it takes at least 5.0 DSL to work.

If it isn't free on amazon and is available on Hulu then it'll have that option. But if amazon doesn't even have it but Hulu does it won't show up.For example, if you search for The Amazing Race it show Seasons 1, 7 and 10 available for purchase for $1.99 per episode or for free through Hulu. But it doesn't show all the other seasons even though these are available in Hulu. You'd have to launch the Hulu app separately to watch them.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/8", "author": "John"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We are very pleased with this device.
