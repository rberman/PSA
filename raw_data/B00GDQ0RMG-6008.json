I was hoping I could sell or regift my chromecast, but I will definitely be keeping it. The quality of image from Chromecast has been vastly superior to what I have experienced with the Fire TV stick. I also find that Chromecast does not have the lag that I'm experiencing with Amazon's product, such that Fire TV stick buffers every few minutes, while Chromecast does not through an entire program. I was especially excited for this product because I wanted to really take advantage of my Amazon Instant Video, but the picture quality and streaming times are so poor that I'll just continue to watch prime video on my kindle. If my experience improves, I'll update this, but it's not looking good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Patricia"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So Far, so good.

Unfortunately, the Fire TV Stick has a ways to go if it wants to compete with the Roku 3 or Apple TV or Google Chromecast (all of which I have). The setup was easy, but the initial software update was very slow. Software installs were quick (Netflix and Plex). The actual usage is where the Fire TV Stick falls on its face. My first test was watching a few things off my Plex server. Even SD content stopped every few seconds to re-buffer; not acceptable. On Netflix, the buffering problems went away, but on both apps the video kept picking up random horizontal lines like it was having a sync issue. Finally, the device required a re-start as the menu response dropped from immediate to around a 30 second delay per button press. Hopefully, future software updates will fix these problems, but for now the Fire TV Stick is a loser.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Mitchell Hamm"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "if it ever gets here..
