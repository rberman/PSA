It is slower that the first computer I ever owned, back in 1992. Anything streaming on it barely plays. Sometimes freezing every few seconds. My wifi connection is great and any of my other streaming media devices work flawlessly. It takes a few minutes just to navigate around apps considering how laggy the whole thing is.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "afifteen"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Just got it and was disappointed it did not come with operating instructions.  I bought a book on Fire Stick from Amazon and found it not helpful at all.  Started playing with and found most documentaries or movies I wanted to see cost money.  Have to go to search for tv sitcoms I watch.  I'm going to keep and hope for better free programs", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susan H.

If you're watching Amazon based programming, either Prime or Amazon Instant Video digital purchase, it plays flawlessly with no buffering and no lag time.  However, if you plan to watch via the Netflix, HBOGo, or Starz Play apps, be prepared for very poor performance at times.  I've had times where these apps were painfully slow.  That being said, I purchased this without knowing those apps were even an option to have, so I just flip back over to the Amazon video and it's fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pure Textuality \"Jena @ PureTextuality\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Loads quickly.
