The setup was a breeze, in no time I was watching movies from my watch list. I tried out the voice thing and it works very well. The only thing is when you use the voice thing to find a movie, it not only searches the prime but the pay movies, which could mess you up if you don't watch out. If you are on the prime movies it still searches all the movies. Maybe there is a reason, but I would like to search just the prime movies. I really like the fire stick over my TV for just the watch list thing, the TV has no watch list feature. I can search prime movies on my pc then view them on any TV in the house. I still gave it a five.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Yak Yak Face \"Yak\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really impressed by the features and the quality of streaming.Installation was a breeze.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike Sweat"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Tried two separate Fire Sticks on two TVs with two different brand new routers with strong wireless signals... junk resolution, when they even worked at all.

I spent 2 hours on the phone, I have to re-explain the issue 5 times, each time you are either given a runaround how they created a case with \"higher technical support\" that never gets resolved (I guess they are waiting for you to give up), or when you ask to be transferred to a US based tech support, you are put on 30 minute plus holds (again the system in place hopes you will abandon any hope in resolution).Update on other shortcomings: there is easy way to cast from your other devices by using apps: allcast that requires allcast client on your device, or AirPlay/DLNA Receiver PRO that works with DLNA and AirPlay devices. Hotel problem is solved with one HooToo TripMate or TP-LINK routers in bridge mode.
