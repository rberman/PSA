[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I just received this a couple of days ago and it is working well.  I also have a Fire TV box so I was able to compare the experience of both units.  I plan to take the Fire TV Stick when I go travelling, so the $19 promotional price made it a no brainer.  My only issue with it is the need to plug it into the provided 5W power adapter.  I didn't know this as I thought you could just plug it into a USB port on a TV, but those ports most likely will not provide enough power.  I guess that's reasonable given how powerful this device is.  So I knocked it 1 star for that, but otherwise it is great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jeff M"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Forced watch video intro after plugging in was not cool.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/7", "author": "rgold"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We have not received our Fire TV Stick yet.

After ordering the Fire Stick and waiting for the arrival I installed a Fire TV unit for a family member, I might have gone with the Fire TV after seeing it.  The voice search is absolutely the best, I work in the Tech field and see quite a but of this kind of thing. As it is I am very pleased with the Fire Stick and ordered the voice remote to use with it and it works just as well...  I think I will be buying another!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/5", "author": "Amazon Customer \"scott@gaskill.com\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Purchased 2 units.  One came dead on arrival, the other works pretty well, but does crash and freeze requiring a power cycle.

Close to the same performance as the original Fire TV for video and audio apps. The interface is responsive and Amazon content starts very quickly. Like the original Fire TV the interface could be a little more streamlined. In my opinion there are too many menus and but it's not hard to figure out. Many people will like the interface as it is graphically superior to the Roku interface.Unfortunately both of my units are going in the \"wait until later\" drawer. I can't use them on a regular basis until Amazon does some of the following:1. Join ultraviolet. Most of my digital movies are in Vudu since they routinely offer a HD Digital Disc price of $1 per movie in lots of 10.2. Link to Disney Movies Anywhere. Both Google Play and Vudu are now linked in addition to iTunes.3. Add the Vudu app. I understand that Amazon wants you to rent movies through them and not Vudu, but the available Flixster app is really slow and really sucks.If Amazon wants me to use the device and rent movies from them I would not have any problem with that as long as they join Ultraviolet and let me watch my purchased movies also. Until then I will have to stick with the Roku's in the house.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "markedman1132"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It took a lot of time to get this to work.

If you aren\u2019t familiar with Fire TV, you might want to start by reading reviews of that box since I won\u2019t repeat a lot of old stuff about Fire TV content.  Notice that there is now an Android app for the Stick, so you can use your phone for voice activation and easier typing.  The Stick\u2019s built in on-screen keyboard for doing searches is pretty good if you don\u2019t have a voice search capability.  A voice activated remote, like the box\u2019s remote, is available separately.The Stick is easy to set up.  Plug it into an available HDMI port(use the included extender if the fit on the TV is tight) and plug in the power supply.  The on-screen instructions talk you through the installation.  I did have to wait a while for the Stick to get a software update.  Once installed, Stick is ready to show movies, tv, music, games, photos.  Its really hard to see the difference between the Stick and the Fire TV box.  A comparison of the specs shows the box has a more sophisticated processor and more memory, so there may be some performance differences, but that wasn\u2019t very obvious to me.  Complex games may show the differences more.There\u2019s really not much more to say.  The Stick provides great content at a reasonable price, especially if you have Amazon Prime.  Its easy for me to recommend the Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "ElViejo"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Don't believe their \"guaranteed\" shipping dates.
