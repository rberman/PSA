Got two, as it's so much easier than moving the one from TV in bedroom to TV in Den. Works better for Amazon movies than my smart TV (faster and smoother). I am now thinking that I need a Fire HDX 8.9 so I can take full advantage. Don't really need a tablet but the 8.9 looks awful tempting. I have only had them for a few months with no problems streaming content with Charter or Brighthouse Internet service.
