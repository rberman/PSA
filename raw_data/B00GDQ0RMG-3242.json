I have very fast internet. I have never had a problem streaming Netflix/Prime/Hulu/etc to my tablet/laptop before. I would use my phone, computer, tablet (and everyone in my house also used their internet based things during this time) and I never had interrupted streaming of anything before. I bought the Fire TV Stick primarily because I wanted to be able to stream to my TV (I use to do it through my Xbox to my TV but every once in a while it would crash and it was frustrating) so I thought the Fire TV Stick would not do that and save me the headache so that I could watch things on a big screen. I was wrong. It crashes more often than my 8 year old Xbox did. That's pathetic for something that's new and should have better/faster technology. So right now, I am up in the air on whether I like this product or not. I am hoping it works better, but I am not holding my breath.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "20SomethingGirl"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "moni"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product.
