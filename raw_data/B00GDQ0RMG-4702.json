[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product. My daughter uses it. Being a Prime customer, I don't know why someone would not get this (unless you have the regular Fire TV). Only issue I have is that in no pictures posted by Amazon on the site and in no TV adds do you see that there is an adapter that needs to be plugged in. Sure, I should have thought of that, but I didn't, and then I was annoyed when I opened it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"Big Boss\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Your missing a lot of apps that Roku and Chromecast provide, i.e. Time Warner app. I can watch my cable with both my chrome cast and roku without having physical cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jason L."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Was easy to set up, works pretty well.
