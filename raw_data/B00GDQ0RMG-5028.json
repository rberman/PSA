I recently got prime so this is a must have. The fire tv stick also has games to play and other cool apps.  I wish it had HBO go the only thing I can complain about.  I can also mirror my tablet to television which comes in handy. So overall I say the fire tv stick does everything it says it can.  I would highly recommend this product...I had to revise my original review.  I have to now give it five stars now that HBO go was added.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "David A."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We had a hard time plugging it directly into the tv and had to use the adaptor. This was actually better since we could hide the whole thing behind the tv.The videos and movies all play as soon as you start them without buffering.

Unfortunately, that is less than 20% of the time.  The rest of the time it's \"Connected with Problems\".  It says my signal strength is good, but can't keep a connection at all.I've tried using different power adapters, moving it closer (which defeats the purpose of buying it) and all other options suggestion on the forums.Maybe a software update will help, but until then I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.Additionally, on occasion  the remote goes crazy when scrolling through prime and will zoom through 10-20 movies instead of just going to the next one when you click left or right.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/6", "author": "David Just"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love it.
