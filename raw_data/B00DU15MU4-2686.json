Amazon advertized games but really how many people would play games with fire tv not with high performance device like xbox/ps. Roku has more coverage for apps like dish world which allows users to watch international tv network. Customer care for fire tv has no idea about when these apps would be available for users. When I mailed customer care, I received a standard copy paste answer without any specifics.My email to customer care was: I couldn't see the app from dishworld on fire tv so reaching out to you. [...]I am planning to buy fire TV but more of the apps are already available on my LG smart TV. one of big use of fire TV for me would be to watch dishworld (For Indian channels in USA). Do you have a plan to add dishworld support on fire TV?Amazon's response:Hello,Thank you for showing your interest in Fire TV.I understand you want to see dishworld app on Fire TV.It is always important for us to hear how customers react to all aspects of shopping at Amazon.com.

It takes far longer to use Amazon\u2019s text based search function, having to first change the search default from voice to text. Then you have to do three steps just to get into the text search area and scroll through letters from A-Z, punching in each one manually. For ease of use, speed and simplicity, Roku\u2019s text based search beats Amazon\u2019s Fire TV hands down.  My thought is now the Amazon Fire TV is clunky, un-polished and missing tons of content filled with useless content. If all you have is a subscription to Amazon Prime, then this box might suit you just fine. But if you want to do more than just stream content from Amazon and want a box that doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s in beta, don\u2019t pick the Amazon Fire TV.  I sent mine back maybe Amazon Fire TV2 will be better.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Kenneth"}]
