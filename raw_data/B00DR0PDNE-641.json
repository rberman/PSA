I ended up buying both because it was Black Friday and got a good deal, and after having and using both, I can describe them well.You literally hook this up to the HDMI port on your TV and follow some simple steps to set it up with your wifi at home and the device you are using for it, this only takes a few minutes.  Then whatever you stream on your PC, tablet, smart phone, will show up on your TV.  So if you have netflix, Hulu, or anything else, you start it up on your device and it'll transfer to the TV, you use your smart device as the remote.You can't beat this for the price.  All I pay for now is good internet, and my Netflix and Hulu Accounts.AWESOME!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alex W"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "a marvel of technology", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Wilfredo Salcedo"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "No problem with this product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Boris Shaevich"}]
