I had to return it though because I did not quite like how it worked with iPhone in terms of rewinding / fast forwarding (mostly because of the iPhone itself: quite irresponsive and cumbersome navigation within a video file, it is not possible to jump forward or back easy, it is very irritating sliding your finger along the slider and while the video jumps a half an hour forward or back when you need just a couple of minutes. Getting to the right position in a video is almost impossible. iPhone is stupid in this respect). I got Chromecast and Roku HDMI Stick instead. A good replacement for this rewind / fast forward nonsense (when you cast videos from devices to TV).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrew"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "DO NOT BUYI tried it then it says An error occurred loading this content  Try again laterIt's just a waste of money", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/4", "author": "Wilson lao"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love Apple TV.

If you own an iPhone/iPad and want an easy way to output audio or hi-def video quickly and painlessly, this is the way to go. My wife and I have one in both the living room and bedroom, and have even bought two as gifts for family. It is easy to connect and setup, and is always ready to go when you want to output from your mobile device. If you don't have one yet and have been thinking about making the purchase, don't wait any longer.

As a converter from my iPhone and iPad's , via Apple's Airplay, for music such as Pandora and Rdio to my Marantz amplifier's HDMI input.  I also use the optical output of the Apple TV for additional analog requirements using a low cost after-market D/A converter.2. For watching Golf on the back deck using either a HD TV or Computer monitor.  In between is a Slingbox connected to my DirecTV and my  iPad's Slingbox App.  This app also provides a HD (proprietary Airplay, non-mirroring) connection to my Apple TV.  Great quality and without having to use another TV converter box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "RED"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great little box, have 2 now.
