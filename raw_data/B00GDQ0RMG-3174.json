The Apps Work great, and it has no speed issues that i can tell.my only 2 complaints are:no universal search. I understand Amazon wants to push their PRIME service, but i got used to it on my mothers ROKU, and miss it very much.It really should come with the voice remote.

The choices of movies are older. The problem I have is with streaming the products. On the IPAD there is no problem however on any other device it takes forever to stream and them continues to buffer every 1:45. This is the same issue with trying to get onto the Amazon home page. Tried at different times of day and still had the same issue... Wish I could stream and not buffer so often.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "sue cavin"}]
