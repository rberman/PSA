It is nice to have access to all the different movie and music apps without having to connect to my laptop through an HDMI cable. However, it has shown me how bad our internet connection is through cable. Connectivity was going out every 10 minutes. Big hassle, but has nothing to do with the Fire TV Stick, which I am very pleased with. Once connectivity is fixed, I expect it to work smoothly so we can watch without much interruption. I think the people we had visiting at our house will be purchasing the Fire Stick too.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisa E.
