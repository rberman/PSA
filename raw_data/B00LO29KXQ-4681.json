It's kind of just been sitting there kind of like the Google Chromecast. It does what it does well.I just wish that all of these little sticks could stream from a local source. I have a server at home and these devices become more of a novelty item because they can't stream.I will say I am looking forward to using this at a hotel the next time I go out of town.If you don't have a need to stream from a local source this stick is a great choice. It's cheaper than the Roku and many other devices yet does the same if not more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kfsutops"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Returned it for the fire TV.

Bought this for a second home since I didn't want to drag my Apple TV back and forth.  Very pleased with the ease of set-up and use.  Even my husband can do it (lol).  As they add more apps it gets even better.  Definitely holds down the cost of cable in a second home where I want to watch something fun without paying Comcast a fortune.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisa M.

Google Firestick +network and find all the others having problems with this device before you purchase. In theory a nice idea, but in practice a disaster. I also have an Apple TV and previously a Roku, both worked much better. Perhaps Firestick still has some growing pains to sort out yet. My advice, wait before you consider purchasing this, especially at full price. I bought mine while it was on presale special so although I'm annoyed, I'm only out $20.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "L.

I replaced my older model Roku 2 HD with one of these.  Unfortunately, I gave that Roku 2 to my parents and I just couldn't ask for it back :( .As I said, my initial reaction was good.  I installed the PLEX app, a few games, and Netflix.  They all seem to run pretty good, except if you leave this thing on for more than a couple days.  I constantly have to reboot it to get things to play.  Sometimes NO SOUND. Sometimes NOT FULL SCREEN.  Returning the devices is no longer an option.My 2nd AFTV Stick is in my oldest kid's room.  It also needs rebooted from time to time. (These are both powered with the wall plug.)  She mostly plays games and PLEX on it.I've come to the conclusion that the only things that work really well on the AFTV Stick are Amazon products.  Amazon VOD, Amazon Prime Music, etc.Overall, I would not recommend these to friends/family.  Spend a little more cash and just get a Roku 3. (or something similar).  If you don't mind not having a PHYSICAL remote , get a Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bfb2k"}]
