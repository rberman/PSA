I can stream Pandora to my TV with chromecast, wait i can already do that with my sony Blu Ray. It sucks! It makes You Tube full screen if I use the chrome browser... not a lot of value added there. On the plus side, I can mirror my laptop to my tv using chrome. Set up is easy and intuitive.

I picked it up in the hopes of being able to stream web programing to my TV. I got it up an running but when it came to stream it was a no go since Google does not support MS Sliverlight and of course the web programing I wanted to stream is using MS SIlverlight. And since I already have a PS3 and the Roku there was no reason to keep this device, so I packed it up and returned it to Best Buy. This device is a great idea in theory but the execution of it is sad with its limited app support and no MS Silverlight support.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Vixen \"groovey\""}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "disappointed with how impossibly difficult it is to connect Netflix to TV  using Silverlight.....still not done....any other options...no problems with You Tube...computer is a Mac", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Raj Mitta"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "If you're thinking about purchasing a Google Chromecast, make your purchase today as this is my 3rd Chromecast that I purchased - One for every TV as it is a must have product.
