Fire is by far the best of the lot.  It is inexpensive, easy to install (very easy), the choices of media are superior and the voice control is (so far) flawless.  After seeing this device in action on my television three friends ordered Fire.  Again, the voice control is superb -- far better than on my iPhone 5.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Pat Choate"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I like my ROKU since it was $50 dollars cheaper and I was able to get BYUtv and other stations which are not available with Amazon Fire TVMake sure and check all the channels available on BOTH before you buy!!!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "2/8", "author": "J. Stokes \"Country Girl\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I have two ROKUs and one WD liveTV 1080P. The Amazon fire TV does nothing special compared to other streaming devices out there. I expected a lot more from Amazon than what it actually is. So, I will straight get into pro and cons.Cons:\u2022 The usage of USB port is a mystery! It is just there for show. Lets just be honest, no one is going to hook up their mobiles and game controllers to be charged (usb port is in the back of the device). If a streaming device has a USB port, the expectation is that you will be able to hook up an external storage device to access personal photos and videos. Looks like Amazon just added a USB port and got confused. So, they left it at that! WD live TV does a better job in connecting external storage and sharing over the network.\u2022 It does not work with old HDMI (Monster) cables. I had to swap out my old cable with a newly bought \u201cAmazon\u201d HDMI cable.\u2022 Not much App support. If you are an Amazon prime member then there is really no need of apps like Neflix, Holu plus, Crackle and such. So, you really are using Amazon content ONLY! Roku does a better job in terms of Apps supported. It has far too many.Pros:\u2022 Looks and feels solid. Does not feel like those plastic boxes\u2022 ScreensaverBottom line: This is NOT a full-fledged streaming device. If you are new to Internet streaming  , you will just be fine with this box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/8", "author": "Tingru Tangu"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "compared to the roku it doesn't have nearly enough options.

It was a great purchase and I highly recommend due to quality of the programming available, price of game apps (waiting on my game controller), ability to watch immediately without long downloads and overall well though out User Experience.Voice search is perfect so far.

Turns out the voice search only works on Amazon. If you're in Netflix, for example, and conduct a voice search, you're redirected to Amazon. However, it's a huge improvement for searching compared to the normal Amazon search function, which is poor. I haven't done any objective testing, but subjectively, the streaming function does seem to work better through this device than through the blu-ray players we've been using for streaming video: it seemed smoother and faster (based on the consistently high resolution stream).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Hermes Ten"}]
