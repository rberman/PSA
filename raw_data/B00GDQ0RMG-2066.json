It said no Network Connection, would go to connection settings and it said there was a good connection.  Constantly buffering, it was very frustrating.  Bought this to replace the Wii and the Wii works much better and is 10 years older! Will be trying the Roku instead, have used Roku before with no problems.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Erika"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I don't like it because it constantly loses Internet connection.
