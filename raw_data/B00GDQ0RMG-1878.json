We can run Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and so much more from a small remote that comes with. We are thinking seriously of downgrading our cable service as a result to save some money whilst adding to our selection of shows (currently subscribed to Netflix Hulu and one other)  all for about 1/3 the price ($30 vs $90-plus)! Although we will occasionally get a small hiccup, where the streaming needs to \"catch up\"  for a second or two (and I think this has to do more with ones internet connection and/or the number of customers online (during a holiday weekend lets say) it has really not been a problem at all.
