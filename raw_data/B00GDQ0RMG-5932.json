[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this for an older TV that we were connecting a laptop for occasional Netlix and Amazon Prime streaming to. This was a perfect, simple and inexpensive solution and the remote works great. The interface is simple and effective, setup was a snap and since I pre-ordered it upon release, the price was only $19.99 and it even arrived a week early.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven R.

Also, some games are \"controller only\" (so you can't play them on the stick remote).  The stick won't pair up with any third party controllers either, so you can forget about using your Playstation or Xbox controller.But wow!  For the money, this is still a good buy - it's much a much more exciting purchase than the Chromecast, although lacks the same casting capability. I still strongly recommend purchasing one though. The Plex app and Fibbage game make this a must-purchase.  It's well made, well designed and the interface is great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rob Chapman"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Just hoping they add HBO GO soon...other than that no complaints!
