I have a large media collection, so i use this instead of a media player.  I had it for 1 day, and ordered another.  Wish the KODI app was in the amazon apps, but you can still side load it.  Overall, this works great and if you know what you are doing.  With KODI you could replace regular cable using this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joe"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It was actually what I hoped it was going to be. It functions quite well right out of the box and as long as you have an HDMI TV and a Internet connection you can stream your shows. On site at a hotel room it's not as easy to use it due to the roundabout way you need to sign in and the device seems to sign itself out after awhile which makes resigning in a little confusing.It unfortunately it's extremely finicky. Like if I didn't plug the exact kindle cord and adapter square that came with it, it won't run. It's very exact which is bad because if I lose the cord and plug that's at least 15-20 bucks so that's bad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Aaron Johnson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jon Waldschmidt"}]
