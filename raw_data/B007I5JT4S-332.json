It has the quality feel that apple is known for. Great for watching netflix but.............. The really cool thing is the air play feature. Air play allows you to display the screen of your iphone or ipad on your big screen tv wirelessly. It is great for convvenient big screen face time or skype.

I purchased this item when it was on sale from amazon 80$! AND I used an amazon gift card too! I can only say I purchased it for less than half of what Its originally worth!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Israel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have grown to love this product and how it integrates with my other apple products.  Is a consistent performer on a solid platform.  i am a cable cutter and this has been best tv product I own (I only wish Apple could integrate some skip-back functionality in the remote (not another button (but maybe a double-click left or right for a short skip back and a triple-click to skip back or forth, a chapter...just saying).Would highly recommend if a new version wasn't due out soon.  I also own a Roku 3, but the Apple TV is a much more polished product and has noticeably better image display properties.  (not to downplay the Roku 3, it's a fine product and I use that daily, as well.  It's image display is not unwatchable, but the AppleTV displays a much crisper image).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "tympanik"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Doesn't work half of the time.
