True to a few of the other reviews, the quality of MLB.tv is pretty lousy. There is a significant amount of buffering -- a lot of buffering. So much so that you can't enjoy the flow of a game when the game is delayed every 20 seconds. If you're buying this to use the MLB.tv app, look elsewhere.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeffrey Turcotte"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought one of these for my nephew when they first came out and it works great.
