The user interface is very well done, and really enjoying the access to some of the amazon gaming catalog.So far I've only had 1 issue, where the device started scrolling in random directions, and then was unresponsive. I was only able to fix the issue by unplugging the power to the device and then plugging it back in.Other than that, thumbs up from me!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jon W."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy set-up!

Borrelli"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This little item works very well for me. It's beyond easy to install and all the info pops right up on the TV screen.You connect the USB to your TV, turn it on and there is the setting menu. Use the included remote to install it to your WiFi network. If your network is secured, as it should be, you will have to remember your password. At first the screen jittered and I had a sinking feeling, Technically, I am not that adept. But, I do have a Fire tablet so I was able to get a program started from there and it immediately showed up on the TV. Magic!  Whatever is on the Fire HD tablet will show up on the TV. Subsequently, it works perfectly from the remote.This is really a terrific tool. I love it and I prefer watching my Amazon Prime movies on the TV. I eliminated cable a month or so ago, so the Fire TV stick is an integral part of my new viewing experience.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "DrD"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jessica Michel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For what it is, it's great!  First rate fit and finish, smooth easy installation and an overall good experience.  It is very similar to Roku so it's not a huge step forward.  It does have great integration with Prime but is missing Slingbox and a few others that I like.  Since Amazon is fairly new I expect they will continue to add the apps and channels that make Roku so great.At $19 for Prime members it's a real deal.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Doc S.

But really...it's just a Roku, only a little smaller...not much to croon over.  But...it works, so I can't really say I don't like it.  It does seem to freeze up a little more often than the Roku did...jury is still out on whether or not that'll get better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt \"Boxless\""}]
