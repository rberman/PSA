[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "The interface of the Fire TV/Stick is not as easy to use or fast as the Roku.  Also, I have connection problems with the Fire Stick that I have not had with any other Wi-Fi device in my home.  The Fire stick has a tendency to lose the Wi Fi signal and then has to be powered off for it to work again.  This is really the first electronic device from Amazon(I own 4 Kindles and 2 Fire Phones) that has not met or exceeded my expectations.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Antina L Bischof"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my fire stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michelle Renee Koons"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very pleased so far.

I was looking for an alternative to using my ps3 for streaming netflix and this solved it over and above. I love that I can manage my music on amazon and stream it to my entertainment center. Plus if I misplace my remote I have the app on my Kindle and both my work and personal phones. Keep up the good work. I do occasionally have some lag problems but I firmly believe that has more to do with my Internet provider", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Johnny"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I love it.  I like thay all of the apps are on the device and dont have to be \"casted\".
