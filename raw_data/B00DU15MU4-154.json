We recently started the cord cutting process and evaluated every streaming device imaginable. There was a great offer with SlingTV and Amazon, so I opted for the Fire TV box and couldn't be happier. It has every app you can imagine. Hulu, Netflix, MLB.TV, HBO GO, Showtime, SlingTV, etc.I have this connected directly to my router with a Ethernet cable and it runs very smoothly with no lag and I have the most economical internet service from Comcast. Combine this with an HD Antenna for local channels and cord cutting has never been easier. Works well with smart TV's.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "J.
