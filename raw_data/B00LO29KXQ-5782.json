I bought this when it was half off to be able to stream, PBS and Showtime. Well, the selection on the PBS app through amazon in highly limited and Showtime won't stream with the cable company I have access to. So, once you collect all of these silly things and fill up your Hdmi ports then you might be able to avoid cable, but it is difficult. and by doing a test, netfliz comes in a little clearer through the Fire stick over the chromecast but it is jumpy between frames.

I reviewed my orders today, December 8, 2014 as I had not yet received a shipment notification, and I absolutely could not find this item in my order history.  I then reviewed my emails, found my email confirmation that I had in fact ordered this item, and the order number.  I typed the order number in on Amazon.com and nothing came up.  However when i ran a \"rder history report\" the Fire TV stick was in there.  So I chatted with amazon on-line ... I will not be receiving my Fire stick as they cancelled the order-2 DAYS after I placed the order, because they were out of stock.  So frustraing, do not order until it gives a close delivery date.This is how our conversation went..You are now connected to Levi from Amazon.comMe:Hello, on 10/27/14 I ordered a Fire TV stick, which is listed in my devices, and it is in my email as \"order received\" and estimated delivery of December 10, 2014, however, when I go into my amazon order history i cannot find the order for my Fire stick. The order number is 10/27/2014 XXXXXXXX Fire TV Stick Electronics . When i download an order report the purchase quantity says \"zero\".

I want to know WHY my order was cancelled. The delivery estimate wasn't until December 10th and this product is STILL available for purchase on amazon .

We are very disappointed in how amazon handled this matter. We were not even aware it was cancelled. I checked my account around Thanksgiving and it was still visible on there telling me there was a December shipping date. And according to you my order had long since been cancelled, with no notification to me.Levi:When an item is listed as \"Temporarily out of stock.

It was super easy to set up, has lots of options and stays connected to my WiFi. Having previously purchased two Chromecasts (one replacement) that don't work well at all, I was a little apprehensive. They wouldn't stay connected and required constant factory resetting, but the Fire stick is so much better. I have had no issues at all except that it is sometimes a little slow to wake up after disuse. My mother has had no trouble with hers nor has my daughter. Definitely worth the purchase.

Roku, Chromecast, and now the Fire stick. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the installation was ridiculous. It wasnt hard, just frustrating. We wanted it for our TV that is not a smart tv. We use our Roku and Chromecast on that one, but thought this was the perfect solution to our guest bedroom needs. I must have misread, because when they made a comparison to Chromecast, I thought that it meant you can mirror the computer with TV. If you can, please comment so I can do this. With that said, it didn't work in our bedroom. It was having trouble connecting to our router. We took it to the Smart TV, same thing, but after several attempts that's the TV, it will work on. The one we don't need to use it on.  The 3 lines button, do not use this to make upper or lower case, physically down arrow over to the abc when connecting the router password to the device.This is as of DAY 1, I will update in a few weeks. It's nice, the kids like that you can get Netflix and few others, but it's nothing that's not on our Roku. My husband likes the free fireplace app, but dislikes that we will still have to use Chromecast to mirror our computer for other things. The picture is nice and the ease of connecting to my Amazon account is nice and scary.
