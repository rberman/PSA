When it sleeps, it creates an error with my TV's HDCP connection.  Each time the fire stick sleeps I have to unplug my tv and the firestick and then restart them both.  Turning sleep off is not an option in the settings which it should be, and if it was an option then i would give it 5 stars, but since it isn't it creates a huge pain every time i want to use it.
