The problem that I'm having though is that the TV Stick will periodically stop working on my WiFi network, all other devices continue working as intended.  I thought it may have something to do with the Xbox 360, Wii, and or DirecTV Genie being nearby, but even with the other wireless devices turned off the TV Stick will still drop the connection, the wireless router is in the next room with a single wall between them.Otherwise, happy with the purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kenneth R.

Can't use it without plugging it into a USB power cord, plugged into an outlet.  Can't use it with a laptop for this reason without using up 2 USB ports and having a 5ft cord in your way.
