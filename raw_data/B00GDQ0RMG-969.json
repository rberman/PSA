I have played with a ROKU owned multiple Apple TV first generation, multiple Apple TV second generation and a third generation Apple TV.  I was so impressed with the functionality and capability of these machines that I have since sold all of my Apple TVs.  Everything from the remote to the on screen performance is phenomenal.  I did have a small issue with one of the remotes connecting, however after less than 2 minutes and a reboot it synced up and have had no problems.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "jal9626"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have both an Apple TV and an Amazon Fire Stick TV.

Had been using my iPad and the Amazon Video app to watch videos, but really wanted to be able to watch on my TV, without paying a whole lot. This little gadget exceeded my expectations - easy to connect, navigate, and super portable! Brought it with me on a recent trip out of town; within 5 minutes, I had it hooked up to the TV, connected to the hotel's WiFi, and the kids and I were having a movie night. I haven't downloaded the remote app as the included remote works fine for my purposes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Z&O's Mom \"Kate L.\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My daughter bought the Amazon Fire TV Stick for me and it is great.

We recently cut the cord and have been cable free, watching Prime offerings on our Kindles and cell phones.  This lets us watch the same content but on the big screen.
