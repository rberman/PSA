It's truly easy to setup and functions as described by Amazon. There is just one major flaw which I find annoying and fail to understand why Amazon hasn't addressed it yet since I'm not the first person to complain about it. Also, Amazon has both the skill and technology to address the issue and resolve it if they wanted to.  The issue is not being able to filter items between what is free to view (based on my Prime account) and the items that will incur a cost to view.  Finally, if there is a cost associated with a title it should be posted clearly with the item in the display panel when scrolling the available video options.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TJ Lannon \"Bear by choice and attitude!\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!
