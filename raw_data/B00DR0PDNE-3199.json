It works great with netflix and youtube but if I try and stream a video from a website onto my tv, it will not work well. Its very jumpy and slow. I have decent internet speed, I dont know if its the chromecast or the tv, or if the chromecast just cant stream video from anywhere but certain sites. I would love it, if i could use this to watch ABC.com and CW.com for shows they have on their site.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rachael"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Super easy to install.

I already use other streaming media solutions (android based) in my home so user experience is not what I'm writing this review about. I think this device will be great for the average user - ONCE THEY GET SOME APPS FOR IT! I couldn't believe how limited I was from my phone and computer with what I could share. Was it easy to do? Yes...and the setup was very simple....but this is not enough for what I was looking for. This product is going on the shelf and I'm using another android stick instead until they can come out with more options. I'm disappointed, but have faith that a google product will catch up - I'm just not willing to wait.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "litelnole \"litelnole\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is fabulous!  I can enjoy HD stuff from Youtube that just doesn't look good (or is laggy) on my laptop/phone.  I don't have Hulu/Netflix but for the money, it's perfect.
