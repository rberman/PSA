[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "\u00a0Being a life-long Apple fan I'm shocked to find myself writing a review of the Amazon Fire TV stick - but having owned an Amazon TV for a while, I bought an additional TV Stick for the spare room, and I have to say I'm delighted.  I've bought (and since eBay sold) two versions of the Apple TV, and neither came close to this.As I work with technology, I'm aware at just how confusing it can be, so I'll steer clear of the Gigabytes and Megahertz and in common with Apple, focus on the actual experience rather than the technology.First Impressions--------------------Opening the box, I was stuck by just how small this device is - not much bigger than a USB storage device.  In addition to the \"stick\" you get a USB cable and power adapter (in case it can't draw enough power from the TV itself), a small but useful remote control, a pair of AA batteries, and a quick start guide.What I really like about the \"stick\" as opposed to the bigger box, is as well as being much cheaper, it's completely portable.  This means that while it's handy for a TV in the spare room, you can also take it with you if you're going away for the weekend (provided the hotel you're staying in has WIFI).Anyway, I plugged it in and it immediately connected to the internet, and up popped a message on the screen....\"Hello John - do you want to log into your Amazon account?\"Just like the main Fire TV, it's a small but very impressive feature.  Clearly when you order the Fire Stick, the actual device is registered to you, and \"knows\" who you are.  You can of course connect to Amazon on another account (for example if you send it as a gift), but it's a lovely to find it works \"right out of the box\".  Good to see also, when you fire it up, it has any Amazon video or music purchases available along with photos and videos.After an initial re-boot to install the latest software it was ready to go.What's it like?==========Scrolling around the menus is smooth and fast, and press \"Play\" and there's absolutely no delay, no \"downloading\" message, in fact no waiting at all.  Compared to the full size fire, there's almost nothing in it, although there was a slightly longer delay in loading apps, for example Netflix.Of course this device is really designed for people with an \"Amazon Instant Package\" which means you can stream a huge number of films and TV programs for free (as well as free next day Amazon delivery).  However, where Amazon scores over (for example), Netflix, is the fact you've got the option to pay an extra \u00a33 and rent a film that's not part of your package.  Being able to do this directly on the TV is a great bonus, and you can of course ensure your credit card is protected by a pin code if needed.From the main page you can view every film, TV programme or App (there's hundreds of games available).  In common with many other set-top boxes there's also complete integration with other media.  This means you can play your music straight from the Amazon servers or load photos, and watch them on the TV.  Any music you've bought from Amazon is instantly available, and you can upload an additional 250 songs for free before buying additional \"Amazon cloud\" storage.Why is it better than Apple TV?=======================Firstly, I'm a huge fan of Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac, TV), but the Apple TV was first launched in 2006, with a minor speed update since.  This Amazon device has a dual core processor, 1Gb of memory and  8 Gb of onboard storage, and is bang up to date.  You're therefore getting a faster device, and when you've got 1,000 programmes to choose from, and a very short attention span - speed counts.While the smooth aluminium remote on the Apple TV may be a lovely design, it still needs line-of-sight to the Apple TV to work.  Sure, no problem, except if your TV is attached to the wall, and the box hidden behind it.  Amazon Fire uses the Bluetooth wireless standard, which means you can change channels from another room if you want to.  A lovely touch.I did wonder whether I'd want to mirror my iPad to the TV, and whether that'd be a deal-breaker.  No problem, you can buy an App for that.If you've got a huge film collection on a computer or NAS you're also in luck here.  Download a copy of the \"Plex\" App, and you can play all your media including films, videos, photos and music from your external device.Unlike the Apple TV you can even play games on this device.  There's hundreds available for free plus lots of paid Apps, and you can even buy a dedicated games controller.Finally, despite having a top end HD television and the latest Apple TV, the picture quality on the Amazon is so much better.  The screen resolution, and ability to fast forward or backward is just terrific.  Oh, and did I mention the \"instant play\" features.  It seems Amazon Fire \"learns\" what series you tend to watch.  So when you're not looking it quietly downloads the first 10 seconds of your most likely selections.  This means when you press play, it just starts immediately.Which to buy - Fire TV or Stick?=======================Well, having played with both, I'd recommend either.  I've summarised the key differences below:-* Voice search:  The Fire has a handy voice search option which really works well.  Press a button on the remote control and say the title of the film or programme you want to watch and it instantly displays a list of options.  I love this feature, especially as there's so many programs available.* Speed:  The Fire has a quad core processor and more memory which gives it a slight edge over the Stick.  However, there's not a lot in it, and both get the advantage of the ASAP streaming which means Amazon quietly downloads the videos in background so when you press \"Play\" they start instantly.  No waiting around.* WIFI only:  Whereas the Fire TV has an ethernet (wired) connection in addition to WIFI, the Stick only has the WIFI option.  Not a deal breaker - but something you should be aware of if you don't have particularly fast WIFI at home.* Optical audio:  Again the Fire TV is equipped with an optical audio output socket for the full Dolby Digital surround sound experience.* Available Games:  One drawback I have noticed is although most games work on both Amazon Fire and Stick, some of the more graphics rich games are not available on the Stick - presumably because it's less powerful, or because Amazon want to target a different audience.So there's not a lot in it really.Overall opinion===========Like thousands of others, I have to agree this is real winner.  The combination of the incredible simple design, super-fast no-wait streaming with an excellent remote control make this device a real family favourite.  I for one am really impressed, and if you've already got the \"Amazon Instant\" subscription with free one day delivery this is a no-brainer.  We've watched far more on Amazon TV now than ever before.The fact it's cheaper and more portable than the main \"Fire TV\" box is just a bonus.Highly Recommended.Design, setup and performanceAt this point in the game, a streaming stick is nothing new. It's a plastic, thumb drive-sized device that plugs into any HDMI port (not just MHL-equipped ports) and draws power from a USB port on the TV or from a wall outlet via the included converter. The exterior itself isn't all that exciting - it's 84.9 x 25.0 x 11.5mm and has the Amazon logo on one side - but it's the lack of any distinct features that help the Fire TV Stick blend into the back of any TV. It even comes with an HDMI extender cable in case you've got a wall-mounted setup and no additional space to spare in the back.While these extras are something the Chromecast comes standard with, the more expensive Roku Streaming Stick does not. Sometimes, it's the simple things in life that really count, and Amazon scores major points for putting the consumer first.After you've got the stick firmly seated in an HDMI port you've got to provide a power solution. You'll need to connect the micro-USB powered stick to either a USB port on the TV or, attach the adapter and plug it into the wall. If you choose the former, you'll get a warning when you boot the system up for the first time. It'll tell you that it can't draw enough power from the USB port to provide the ideal experience. I opted for the power via a wall socket.Games are also present and accounted for on Amazon's smaller system, and for the most part the less-intensive titles play incredibly well. Disappointingly though, you won't find many graphically demanding games here like The Walking Dead Season 1 or 2.Buy Amazon Fire TV Stick at John Lewis for \u00a335.00Nor are you likely to spot Grand Theft Auto here anytime soon. That doesn't seem to be due to any fault of the hardware - the system boasts the right specs for those higher-end games - the content simply isn't there.f you're a Fire TV owner you'll notice that this remote doesn't come with the built-in mic and voice-search button. The functionality still exists if you use the accompanying Fire TV app, but it doesn't exist on the pack-in peripheral.If you really need it, though, Amazon sells the full-size remote separately or allows you to sync your old Fire TV remote to the Stick without much of a problem. It just goes to show how much this functionality costs - but we didn't think it detracted too much from the viewing experience.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Ryan \"Scouse in the semi-detached house\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "donna lowe"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I was very disappointed in that I thought I could watch TV with this device but every time I try to watch something it asks for my provider( I am trying to ditch expensive cable as I am retired on fixed income etc etc).

It has given me little but trouble the whole time I've had it.  It took several hours to get it set up to begin working - several calls to amazon and to our cable company (each sayig it was the other's fault it wasn't working - though they each tried to help).  Finally got it working.  Hurrah!  It worked well for a day or two, but since then, it pauses every couple of minutes when playing a program or movie.  I really like it when it works, it just doesn't work consistently.  Sometimes the message on the screen says my internet is too slow (so I call my cable company and they tell me I am getting the high speed internet I am paying for, so it can't be their fault); other times the message on my screen says that there is a program error and I need to call amazon.Bottom line is that it just did not work consistently. I finally gave up last week and just hooked my kindle fire back up to the tv, with the cord; that system works just fine - never a problem with speeds or anything.  I'm sure that means something, but I don't know what it would be.  I don't know if I would recommend the firestick to anyone because it just didn't work for me; but when it did work, I really liked it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Loves A Good Story"}]
