This is actually the biggest problem with the new kindle hdx - no hdmi OUT except for the miracast ... and that frankly doesn't work very well. Very disappointed in that lack in new hdx coupled with the fire stick. If all you want is a cheap way to stream netflix or prime, it's okay for that ... but any device practically will do that.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "RCH"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works great!
