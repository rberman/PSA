[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "we were very disappointed in this product.  first of all, the software had problems the screen kept freezing. Second, compared to our Roku it was far harder to navigate when it did work. Finally, since we already have Roku and Amazon Prime we were looking for internet access and HBO GO. This product had neither. If you want Netflix and Amazon Prime get a Roku. It is much easier to work", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "wordmavin"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really liked this product and I highly suggest it but , the search engine is a little hard to use", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very happy with it.

If your TV has a usb, use it to power this device. Much faster and a cleaner look instead of being plugged into the wall. Doesn't take long to load videos. Video quality is nice too. I liked it so much, I bought three.
