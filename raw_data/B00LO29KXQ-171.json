[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've been a diehard Roku fan since the original.  But for the money, the Fire TV Stick is the best media streamer on the market. It doesn't have the channel selection of the Roku, but if you subscribe to the big 4:Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and HBO...the TV Stick is the way to go.  The U.I. is faster and content loads almost instantly.  The Fire TV Stick has its own remote unlike the similarly priced (but functionally deficient) Chromecast. Plus, if you really need to play Android games on your TV, the TV Stick has a fairly healthy selection to choose from.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gary Lobaugh"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product for movies.  My 4 year old loves this almost as much as Netflix.  The remote is a little touchy at times, but I'm not sure if that's an issue with the remote or the internet connection.  Overall a good product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "George"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very good opcion", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "yeney hernandez"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am so glad I took advantage of a lower price offer and ordered this.

First, remote is too small. It's constantly getting lost, or falling in between the couch cushions. It's become quite a pain always trying to find the remote. Second, the device has a tendency to over heat. If watching for a long period of time, the picture will freeze , it wants to reboot, and sometimes it just completely shuts down. I make sure I unplug my fire stick before retiring for the evening or the next day it won't work because its too hot.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Patty Pennell"}]
