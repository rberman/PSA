Unfortunately, the 8 year old machine finally died as it was abused (not usually turned off after use). We borrowed a Chromecast device that worked very well for Netflix but wanted to watch Amazon as well. We read that although Chomecast is not supported by Amazon (or is it the other way around?) it can be made to work. To make things easier on ourselves, we decided to purchase the Amazon Fire TV Stick since it works with Amazon and Netflix right out of the box.We are very disappointed. The only positive about the product is the price. We frequently get errors such as internet connection too slow. We have 75mbs download speed verified by various speed tests. We rarely had these types of errors on the Playstation and our trial run of the Chromecast device never had an error.Additionally, the picture using the Fire TV Stick is usually not in HD due to its inability to utilize our hi-speed internet connection. Perhaps it would be able to utilize our hi-speed internet connection more efficiently if it were closer to our wireless router. Once again, this was not an issue with an 8 year old Playstation 3 or the Chromecast device that we borrowed. When the picture is in HD it usually coincides with slightly jerky motion and voice not matching the video perfectly.If I were using this on the road in a hotel it would be sufficient. However, on my 60inch Samsung in the living room, it is just not acceptable. Hopefully, I will be able to experiment with moving the wireless router to a location in close proximity to the Fire TV Stick. If it doesn't fix the issues, I will return this product. Perhaps the Fire TV Box is better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mike"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very good inexpensive media device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jacob Cullen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This compact device uses advanced technology to deliver an easy to use format for accessing streaming video and music.It is the simplest and most powerful electronic interface I have ever used.
