[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I'm really impressed with this streaming tool.  The setup was easy, and the menu navigation is very intuitive. I easily linked my Amazon prime, pandora, YouTube, and Netflix accounts.  However, the preloaded HBO Go app is not the same as the HBO Now app, so I was unable to use my HBO Now streaming service, which is a major disappointment.  I would recommend this gadget for anyone looking to link their TV with streaming app services.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephen Sapienza"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matthew S.
