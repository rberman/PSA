It took me quite a while to realize that I had to go to the Play Store and download the apps for the video channels that I want to watch, install the chromecast app on my phone and then bring up the video channel's app and click on a small rectangle that transfers the screen output from the phone to the TV screen.

I love the idea of being able to cast tv shows, pandora, etc, from my computer or smart phone. However, this thing RARELY works! I used it three days ago to watch a movie, then tried to cast Pandora today, and the cast button wouldn't come up on my phone, so I tried it on the computer and got the same message that I am SO tired of - No Device Found. The support pages at Google are NO help. Then one day it will just randomly work. But most of the time, no dice. I wish someone could explain to me what the problem is.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
