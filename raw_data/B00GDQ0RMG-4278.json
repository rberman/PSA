I bought the fire TV first and liked it so much that I wanted another device and bought the stick to put on another TV in my home because I didn't want to pay as much for another device.  The fire stick works great but because of its limited memory size you can't store as much on it as the fire TV but there's still plenty of room for apps that you may not even notice (but what do you expect for something so small?).  I've noticed when I'm navigating quickly on the menu that it freezes and I have to wait until it unfreezes, which gets somewhat annoying but it's really not a big issue.  I've never owned another streaming device like a chromecast, but for the money, I really like it and would buy it again.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Luke B"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "cant access wwe network,thats all i wanted it for", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "terry"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I bought the Fire Stick because Amazon Prime regularly prompted me that I wasn't using Prime for anything except free shipping. I used my laptop to watch part of a terrible movie, but that is not how I want to view content in my leisure time, thus the Fire Stick, so I can sit in my recliner and watch my plasma TV in comfort. I have only had my Fire Stick for a few days and admittedly, have not spent a lot of time playing with it and getting familiar with the functional use.Here is what I can say as of now: Setup was amazingly easy and quick. Plugged the AC adapter into the power and HDMI connector into the side of my TV and away it went! It found my network and after a few fumbles entering the network password with the remote, it recognized me and my Amazon Prime account and seamlessly finished the registration process and took me to an introduction screen. I tried it out, searched around a bit, and then watched 8 episodes of the hysterically funny Alpha House. Haven't spent enough time on functional searching, which is not so intuitive (there has to be better way than scrolling past the thumbnails of series and movies aimlessly when you really don't know what you are looking for). The next time I used it, nothing appeared on my TV when I pressed the designated input on the TV remote. I played around with it a bit on the Fire Stick remote and then back to the TV remote and it popped on. Not sure what that was about. I liked that when I went back to Alpha House, it recognized that the next episode in the series was where I wanted to be to continue. I didn't have to remember where I left off. I then programmed my iPad and iPhone to act as remotes. They aren't better than the Fire Stick remote, but I believe it does allow search function, which I have not investigated to date. Voice activation would be a plus. I don't think it is available for iOS, though, yet, but I could be wrong. I need to do more research and the Amazon site left me hanging after set up. Do I need to buy a Kindle book on using Fire Stick? Really? Meanwhile, it streams flawlessly. A/V function is superb. It won't replace my cable, but it is a nice adjunct. I have no comment how it works relative to Roku or Chromecast, but I got this one because I am an Amazon Prime customer and so much content is free.There are still too many remotes on my table: Pioneer TV (to turn on and change input), Comcast Motorola cable, Yamaha audio, Sony DVD, and now Fire Stick. I still have a Sony VCR, which I use as a digital clock under the TV, but it needs to be reset with power surges/outages. If there is a universal remote that isn't equivalent to flying a Boeing 777, I need it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "drjazz86 \"Ronald B.

Set up was a breeze. The remote makes far better than other services for Internet TV and movies. However my problem with amazon movies.  all the free movies that  are available through amazon prime are old and there is a cost for renting current movies even with an amazon prime membership. .other than this the firestick is great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bthomas2040"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Exceeded expectations", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "david chromey"}]
