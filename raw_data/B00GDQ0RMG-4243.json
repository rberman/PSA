It was late in the night when I finally finished work and I decided to attempt hooking it us (against the protests from my girlfriend). Within three minutes I had it hooked up, and when I turned it on it already knew it was me. All I had to do was put in our wifi password and we were off and running. The streaming was instant. We have Netflix on our TV through Apple TV and there is always a short delay. Not with the fire TV Stick. It was instant and the picture was crystal clear.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Barbara J  Hawk"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I meant five stars. It works great.

This works great and is easy to set up. No voice command on the remote but does everything in our life have to be? I was very pleased with the signal and lack of buffering. You can't tell you are using this, as the picture is identical to your TV. No buffering, no digital camo. Great for travel to take your Prime on the road with you!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BluePnut"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very easy to set up.

As an added benefit, thought I'd explore the other perks that came with it, such as movies, music and books. As I'm a young-senior citizen (and very tech savvy), I thought I might enjoy watching movies, although that is what a TV set is for, traditionally.So, to facilitate that, I purchased the Fire TV Stick (I have FIOS so streaming is high-speed).Install of the Fire TV Stick was quite simple. All pieces/parts were included and I got it up and running very quickly.The hardware and firmware of the Fire TV Stick is very good.BUT...my disappointment was in the media that was available to me. Amazon Prime promotes \"watch 100,000 movies...hear millions of songs...read thousands of books\"...sounds to good to be true...and it was!I had access to all of this media, but only a small fraction of it was \" Free (?)\". The marketing promo for Amazon Prime leads one to believe that ALL of the Amazon libraries media is free(?) - wooohooo.Granted...there is a small amount that is free(?), but most is pay-to-play.So beware. Read the fine print (which I did, but was still confused) and don't expect the Golden (FREE) Egg.Have fun...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "John k.
