Been seeing alot of copy and paste reviews on here, suspicious! This is just pay per view, everything or loaded to the brim with commercials. Even You Tube.I was already a PRIME member for over 5 years when I bought this, when TRYING to use this little SCAM MACHINE, I hit the button that said, Watch at $0.00 cost for PRIME MEMBERS, my results were it charged me AGAIN for another prime account at $99 bucks INSTANTLY. Mine don't expire for 4 more months. Worst part, I only put money on the debit card I use for this account AS I USE IT to keep down chances of ID theft, so it bounced the card ( another $15 fee on me). How exactly, when i had to signed INTO THE ITEM with my account to set it up, but got hit for $99 bucks when clicking on ANYTHING in it.EVERYTHING ON THIS P.O.S. Device is $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ and MORE $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.$9 a month for Roku, and you get all the same stuff. BUT, from 99 cents to $30 per view, you get this???? WHAT!To use ANY OPTION it cost you. Even on Crackle all the movies you click on shows you commercial after commercial then the WRONG MOVIE! EVERY TIME!Thought I was getting access to what I was ALREADY PAYING FOR! NO F'n way dude, everything is pay, pay or its a joke joke.Even YOU TUBE on this is loaded to the hilt with commercials.Buy you that little Mica unit, a card, download videos and watch them yourself. This is a total waste of time and money.Unless your Cable or Satellite bill is $200 a month+ how is this cheaper after 30 days of use when its ALL pay per view?I feel lied to, and tricked.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/8", "author": "Madashell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to use, remote is plus to have.  Better than Roku, good buy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JJ"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I own an Apple TV and an older Roku HD. I am so thrilled with the Fire TV stick that I've barely used the other boxes since I got it. I especially love the interaction with my Kindle HD (2012 model). I didn't think the older tablet would work with the Fire TV stick, but it does. I like being able to initiate a movie on the Kindle and push it to the TV (much like my iPhone with the Apple TV), but the X-ray feature adds so much more to the experience. Also, the Fire TV app allows me to do voice search, which is really cool. Not a bad deal for $19! It's a must-have if you are a Prime customer and use the streaming video benefit.NOTE: I had a few glitches when trying to set it up. The software update failed twice. Third time was a charm and it's worked beautifully ever since.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "praise74"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "2014.12.05 It just arrived. Still exploring so just some quick notes now.PROS* Easy setup* My Amazon Prime account watchlist and music all there for me to browse through.* Love the Amazon Music option. It sounds GREAT!* Nice FireTV app available for your phone or tablet with voice option (it quickly takes you through an app tutorial)NOTES* Tiny remote - not really a con but it may be for some. Definitely recommend downloading the Fire TV app and setting it up as a backup in case you can't find the remote.* WISH - Would love to have the Audible app (if it is there I haven't seen it yet)* CON - It may be just me but the way the scroll moves images one at a time when browsing movies or TV shows does a little jump that is a bit hard on my eyes. Tried a fast scroll but it is REALLY fast.

It was up and running in about 1 minute. I set it up on my 5ghz WiFi and performance seemed good. I watched a movie via prime, played a game and watched a movie via Plex. All worked well. Not laggy, good performance. Fire Stick searches for the remote during setup. It only has 2 ports. HDMI Male and Micro USB female for power. Micro USB would not take mouse/keyboard input that I tried. I didn't test the range of the remote, but the remote was quick and functional.Menu says that there is Bluetooth for controller.Gets somewhat warm - I used it for about 30 minutes.Package comes with power supply, cable, remote batteries and ~3 inch HDMI extension cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Frank_F"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Bought 2 of these on introductory offer.

We almost got a Roku at one point, and then considered Chromecast and of course FireTV. Our primary TV has a pretty nice computer hooked up to it, so we usually watch Prime or Netflix via the computer and decided to hold off.However, when I had the chance as a Prime member to purchase this for $19, I jumped at the chance, figuring we could use it on our bedroom TV and when travelling.We have found it well worth the $19, and would have found it perfectly reasonable at $39. The picture is crisp, the speed is great and we have had zero issues with it. It worked perfectly right out of the box. Setup was fast. The added HDMI extension is super useful :)The downside is that the power supply takes up quite a bit of real estate on the powerstrip (covers half of the spot beside it).
