I no longer have cable.  It's like having a DVR.. and with Amazon Prime and apps like HULU and CRACKLE there is always something to watch.

This past week is was on sale for $34 (maybe because of father's day?) so I went ahead and purchased it for my husband.  We used it for the first time last night and we already love it!!  We have one smart tv in our house that lets us view netflix, amazon prime, and a couple others, but this has so many other options and access to music apps like pandora, Iheartradio, and others!  We will be moving soon and have decided to only get internet service and not cable/satellite.  I honestly don't think cable/satellite will be missed!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sara E Pluta"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Not a great improvement over my DVD player with access to netflix/hulu/etc.  I was assumed that this, being an amazon product, would have access to amazon apps.  It cannot play audible.  I don't know about anything else, but after I discovered this I just unplugged it and reconnected my DVD player.It does install very smoothly though.

Works as advertised.  I like that other Google apps can be installed, but the process is definitely not intuitive.  Would like it to derive power from the HDMI port if possible.  Not having to use the power supply would make it much more portable.Regarding content - it does exactly as you'd expect, but the selection process is a little cumbersome.  What I'd really like to see (and I know this isn't Amazon's responsibility) is to have live feeds off the TV channels like National Geographic and The Weather Channel.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Matt Z \"Matt\""}]
