Been a prime customer and fan of Amazon for years. Bought this device when it first came out for 19 bucks . As everyone knows , it took many weeks to actually arrive but that was okay as it was going to be a Xmas gift . Gift was given Xmas eve to in-laws. Christmas day my credit card was charged for another prime account while was out of town. I later that day found out that it was unknowingly bought by my in-laws when trying to watch a movie . Long story short ......THIS device ships preregistered to buyer ! , no login or password required to use ! Unacceptable !  My account was accessible to the gift recipient ! Amazon credited my account and deregistered the device over the phone, but I feel this should, at the very least require a password before it is usable to prevent  someone getting the device who is not authorized. Shipping the device preregistered and ready to use is not a secure situation for customers !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "billy bob"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love this amazon stick very fast and reliable", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TAEIL GOH"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "My husband loves this way better than the Apple TV!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lea Anne Douglas"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I think this was the best Christmas gift of all.
