It works flawlessly. My favorite feature is streaming content from my iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the TV. It just works. Plain and simple. Apple designs their products to be easy to use. This is no exception. Channels and features are added quite regularly. Be advised not all channels will work unless you are a paying cable or (certain) satellite customer. For instance, I can't watch shows on the ABC channel because my particular satellite provider isn't set up with them for this access. However other channels like A&E; and the History channel work fine. I like being able to pull up the radio icon and find my local stations to listen to crisp and clean since I don't get very good reception where I live.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Wooderson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "its a apple product they work well when they want to and other times they don't . my go to is a roku but it you want airplay you stuck with this, i really wish they would bring back a analog output would save me a lot of time and money but thats never going to happen", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Jason P.
