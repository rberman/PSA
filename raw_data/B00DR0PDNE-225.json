I can't keep track of who google has partnered with, and nor do i want to have to research it.  I just wanted to be able to pull up a menu and select, whatever media i wanted ie netflix, spotify, youtube etc.  Also disappointed that if i just wanted to use it to mirror my screen i have to go through so many workarounds.  I would love to just be able to pull up any app/media/program i want and have it on my tv.  Honestly bought it thinking i could use it with KODI only to be disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "J.
