Great product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Emily"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great! I mainly purchased the fire stick to work with our living room television that is not a smart tv. Much more convenient than waiting for our PS4 to boot up and wait to access netflix app plus easy access to prime content. The fire tv stick performs beautifully with my LG tv. Thanks to the Simplink feature on my tv I can hit the home button on my fire stick remote and go straight to the menu no need to manually switch to the required input. No problems with the app so far.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mayra T"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Stable quality and good features.It is worth to purchase at 40USD.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sang H Kim"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love it.
