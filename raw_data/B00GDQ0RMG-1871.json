[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a pretty cool lil' device. Install and registration was a breeze. I downloaded the FireTV iOS App (allows for voice search and a keyboard) in favor of the included remote, and am quite impressed with this package. The Fire TV Stick is a must have for those looking to stream Amazon Prime Videos, as with augmenting their home (iOS-driven) entertainment system. Will be handing these out during the holiday season.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "OCTrojan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fast, efficient, and easy way for me to get my instant video binges.
