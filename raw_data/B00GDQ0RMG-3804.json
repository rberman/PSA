Streams well and no problem connecting to router. Easy set up. The big problem is this product gets very hot while plugged into the back of the TV. I had to unplug the Fire TV Stick from back of the TV and adapter to get it to cool. Heats up very fast again. The remote also sticks and doesn't respond well at all. There is a huge delay between pressing a button and initiating the action. Not sure if this is a side effect of it getting so hot but it doesn't happen until it has been plugged into for awhile. Need to work on some glitches with the responsiveness in the remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

NOT!I am not a movie watcher so 95% of the functions & content are useless to me.  Free to download apps but then you must pay a monthly fee to watch movies.  I already pay for an internet cable package.  I am glad to access YouTube but again disappointed that none of the apps on my tablet work on my TV with the Fire Stick & there is no browser app available.  So for me it is the Amazon YouTube stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Vera Samuel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the Fire Stick.  I already owned a Roku and bought the fire stick on a two day sale for 19 bucks a few months ago just in case my Roku failed.  I just hooked it up this weekend out of boredom (snowed in) and my family just loves it.  I read the reviews on cnet and youtube and just figured the two were about the same, only difference Roku had more channels according to reviewers. Wrong, as a prime member I wish I had this thing hooked up months ago.  If you are a prime member I feel this is a must.  All the channels we watched on Roku are on the Fire Stick and the navigation is simple.  We are cord cutters from way back and mainly watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Crackle, PBS, PBS KIDS, A&E; and History and we listen to Pandora alot.  All of these work great on Fire Stick.  My daughter enjoys playing games on it.  I love listening to my music that I have purchased from amazon over the years and the free music available through my prime membership.  Many of the songs we play on the TV using the Fire Stick show the lyrics so its kinda like karaoke.  Only complaint is that there is not an app to make my old 1st gen Kindle Fire a +remote.  Oddly enough there is a remote app for the Roku that works great on my 1st gen Kindle Fire .  I guess this is Amazon's way of making loyal customers buy the latest Kindle Fire.  Not me, I got a great app from the Apple app store that makes my Ipad a voice remote.  I know alot of reviewers would deduct a star for this but I understand it is just business.  Not good business since there are so many ways around the remote issue like using a different tablet, or an android or an Apple phone and installing a free app.  But that means a loyal customer of yours has put down your product and picked up someone else's.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ted Mayes"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "lots of apps and streaming available, except NO HBO GO.
