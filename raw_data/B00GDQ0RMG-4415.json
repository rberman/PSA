Once that task was successful, however, I was able to try the Stick out.  It worked VERY well, and exceeded my expectations.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "j brown"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it.

I am a Prime member, so it has a lot to offer! Although I can't compare it to other devices, it's easy to manage. A suggestion would be to illustrate how to open the remote in order to place batteries. I had to pry it open using a knife. Also, if you are not familiar with Input features on your TV, that too may be an issue. It's also inconvenient to keep changing from the actual TV input to the Fire stick input viewing.Overall, I am enjoying viewing Amazon Movies and TV shows on the Fire Stick rather than on my iPad.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chrissie"}]
