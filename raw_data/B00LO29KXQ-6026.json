Because it doesnt do anything nearly as well as the roku does.  roku has tons more channels, has mirroring as well, and its user interface (while not perfect) is much better and user friendly than the First TV/Stick.  Are there games on this device?  Yes.  However they are ok, nothing that will blow your mind.  I know its \"Amazon's\" version of the Google store but if I already purchased a game in google play I shouldnt have to repurchase it on Amazon.  Also, the BIGGEST drawback is no Vudu app.  Seriously.  Sure there is Flixster but they dont have the deals that Vudu has.  Do I have all 1500+ apps/channels on my roku?  No.  I have about 130, the ones that my family needs.  Another one is Popcornflix.  There are about 3-4 apps (comedy, kids, etc) and those movies are all FREE.  There are also many that ARE NOT COMPATIBLE with Fire TV/Stick.  Popcornflix, TNT Overtime, Sirius Radio, fox sports go, animal planet, dailymotion, and more.We cut the cable 2 years ago and are VERY satisfied with the Roku 3's we have.  This device is a STEP BACKWARDS from a 2 year old device.I am honestly VERY disappointed in this device, was very excited for it, and pre-ordered it.  So glad I did not waste $40. and got it at half that.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "S.

For $19 and an Amazon Prime membership, I've just joined the rest of the universe and am catching up on programs and movies I've only gotten to hear about from other people with huge monthly cable bills that I refused to take on. Amazon has a couple of streaming TV shows with John Goodman and Jeffrey Tabor that I can't wait to watch...on my schedule, when I please, and without constant commercials!!!

I love my Chromecast, and bought on for each room in my house.Pros:-Handy remote is really cool and convenient-When it comes to Prime videos, this product does extremely well. The integration, the \"Watchlist\", the continuous playing (for TV shows), etc... they're all there.-The screensaver is pretty nice. Instead of just showing nice pictures (scenery and such) it actually pans or zooms out to make it seem like the scenes are moving.-Spotify \"app\", which the Chromecast does not have integration with [yet?]. NOTE: I know you can use the web player for Spotify and \"cast\" the tab, but it's not the same as having true integration within the apps. Google Play Music looks infinitely better on the Chromecast due to the album art and info displayed on the screen.Cons:-While it integrates really well with it's own products (Prime), all the \"additional\" features such as Netflix and Hulu are \"apps\". That means you have to download them and launch the specific app to use it. This means you cannot \"add\" Netflix movies or Hulu shows to the really nice \"Watchlist\".-Although it has more \"horsepower\" than the Chromecast, I really don't see the need/purpose. The Chromecast handles all the same things at half the specs. But more \"specs\" isn't really the con here; it's that I can launch and play things like Netflix and YouTube MUCH faster with the Chromecast. This means I get to see my shows and switch between what's on the Chromecast much faster. The Fire Stick relies on \"apps\"-YouTube casting is so much easier on the Chromecast. Typically I'm browsing on my computer and want to put it on my TV, I can just cast it. With the Fire Stick, I would need to turn on the Fire Stick, use the remote to open the YouTube apps, search for the video I want, then play it. The searching is the tough part. Have you ever searched for a video and found 50 versions with the same \"preview\" pick? You now have to search through and find WHO posted the video so you can get the right one. Blagh!Conclusion:If you're a heavy Prime user (movies/TV), then you can't beat the Fire Stick; there's just no easier way to browser, add, and watch Prime content. However, if you like Netflix, YouTube, and Google Music/Movies, then the Chromecast is better. Both will continue to add more content to their respective products; however, I think Amazon needs to built-up their integration a bit more so that they don't rely on \"apps\" so much. I think if they can get all the different \"video\" content integrated into their \"browse\" and \"watchlist\" sections, they'll be in a MUCH better position.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brown"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I had to restart (unplug and plug it back in) the fire stick 4 times during watching a movie on Netflix.
