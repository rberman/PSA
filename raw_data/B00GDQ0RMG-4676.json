Hollis \"humblewannabe\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought my husband the Fire TV Stick for Christmas and he (great minds thinking alike) bought me a Roku 2. We both prefer the Fire TV Stick by far. It is much faster than the Roku 2, the remote is superior (more intuitive to use), and the user interface is much, much, much better and more pleasant to use. The only thing that my husband likes better with the Roku is that you can plug headphones into its remote and listen to the TV through the headphones at night and not disturb your partner. I particularly like this feature when he wants to watch a movie that I'm not interested in watching or even listening to in the background (super violent movies). It would be nice if Amazon would add this feature to future versions of the Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kate"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great idea.

I just wish someone could come up with a on demand subscription that includes every movie and show for a monthly fee. Otherwise you piece together so many plans and pay per view ... It just seems to be getting a bit ridiculous.  If you combine this with TV or satellite programming you would have it all...
