I am loving it. I have also now bought 3 of them. This has replaced my cable now. 5 stars to the programmers. They are constantly updating with new apps and games which keeps my hole family entertained. Easy to use with my kindle fire tablet for any extra streaming I might want to do. I hope they continue with adding new apps as this means a lot to me. I was even able to buy a cable that allowed this to used with an older tv that did not have an hdmi port. ( av to hdmi converter) another pluse to me is parent controls. I can regulate what my kids can get into.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "lkjghjgkjhg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Purchased two of these. One for my sister and family that are not into technology (I frequently have to go help set up new equipment and troubleshoot their old when it breaks). They find it very easy to use and all the members are able to understand it. It was originally purchased for Netflix access and now they use it for other applications. I have not had to go over and assist any of them on how to use it. I set it up (created an account and logged on for them) and put the remote in their hands.As for the second unit. This was for our family. It was purchased for SlingTV and some Netflix (we use XBOX 360 for Netflix most of the time). It works seamlessly and is easy to use for the whole family. Remote is simple and can be used for many games and the menu system is easy to navigate.Only draw back in both installs was finding another plug in to power the stick. Both our power strips were full before installing these.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "K.

I own a Roku and Google Chrome stick and would put this at a close second behind the Roku.1.  The remote is great.  It's not infrared so works anywhere in the room similar to the Roku.  The Google Chrome stick does not come with any remote so you need to use either your phone or computer to stop the video.  While using another device to control the playback seems simple enough, it is not convenient especially when you have kids and a show you are watching suddenly turns NSFW.2.  The Fire Stick is quick.  I use the USB to outlet adapter that comes with to give it all the juice it needs.  The option to plug into the TV USB does exist but from past experience direct power works better.  The menus load quickly and the shows start instantly.3.  The only downside I've seen so far is that the PLEX app does not respond like it does on the Roku.  It is buggy and will play then stop suddenly and ask me to login after I already have like 3 times.  Not sure who to blame (plex or firestick) but want consumers to be aware that not all apps run as smoothly as other devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MandM"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Poor video quality.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "noname"}]
