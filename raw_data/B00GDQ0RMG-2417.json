Moved it around for better signals.  Worked, didn't work, worked, didn't work.  Sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it wouldn't find the signal, sometimes it worked perfectly when turned on.  Not dependable.  Very disappointed in the quality for his device and even more disappointed in the fact that Amazon will not provide a refund for this substandard product.  I have been a Prime customer for many years and spend lots of money here and I'd hoped for better service.
