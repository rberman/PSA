Turns out you can't be more than 20' from router to maintain a reliable wifi connection and  when I loose connection with fire stick router, I resolve by removing power to fire stick for 10-15 seconds. I haven't had any problems with Google Chrome Cast.

It works better than other streaming devices that I have used.

I had one T.V left in the house that was not a smart TV and had a Roku hooked up to it. Decided to try this out and man is it great.

I've been playing Amazon Prime videos from my phone, but they were often choppy.  Now they are nice and smooth, and I can do other things with my phone.However, I wish there was an iphone app for the remote, because I'm sure at some point I'll lose that tiny little remote.  And, I wish it didn't automatically start playing the next episode of a series when the first one ends.
