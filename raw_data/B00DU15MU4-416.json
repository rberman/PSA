[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Not really as good or even in the same ballpark as Apple TV. I pay for more movies and TV programs on Amazon Fire TV as opposed to Apple TV using Netflix as one example. This is very strange as one would think that having Netflix would be the same on any devise. NOT TRUE! There is more \"Out of pocket\" money for movies and or TV programs on Fire TV, thus making it redundant and more costly if you already have Apple TV. This is a miss for Amazon's launch into this industry by trying to take on Apple TV or others like it. I recommend Apple over Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Dr. Greg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cb \"C.

I switch from Direct TV in four rooms to Amazon Fire TV in four rooms. My annual savings will equal $1679.00 per year. I have all the shows I enjoy looking at between Huluplus (7.99) and Netflix (11.99) per month and Amazon Prime. It was simple to set up and easy to use.

Well I know this came out in 2014 but still!.Overall with ability to side load apps from google play and now that it allows external storage it's a great android tv box but does have some minor flaws.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SG."}]
