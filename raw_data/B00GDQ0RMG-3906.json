I have both. I've had the Fire for months on the living room tv and love how easy it is to use. My four year old can even operate it. So, when our Chrome device on my daughters tv when out I ordered the fire stick as a replacement. It's good. Still easy enough for her to use and if you aren't particular a great option for someone who doesn't want to pay the higher cost for the Fire. There are some notable differences between the two deceives,though.The remote is better constructed and more responsive on the Fire. Plus, the fire has HBOGO and the stick doesn't, which if I knew at the time of ordering, would have affected my decision to purchase it over the Fire. Overall both are good devices and I would recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Peedelee"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jenny Weaver"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fite stick works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael wilder"}]
