I have the same complaint that I had with Netflix, movies are not that current and I'm not interested in watchings reruns.  My internet provider says all I need is 5 or 6 mbps to stream but I'm getting about 13 and still have to ocassionally wait through buffering.  I'll give it some time to see how It goes and then update my review.

Since this could be an issue with my TV and not the device, I'm not considering it a \"con\"Cons: Some streaming apps are constantly stalling or buffering, the Hulu Plus app is especially prone to freezing the picture while the sound continues to play  1-Click checkout is mandatory. Therefore, my dog was able to download an episode of a TV show that I had never heard of, and had no interest in watching. I'm out $3 and stuck with a show I don't even want. I wish I was making that up, but in the 2 minutes she was left unattended, she got the remote and chewed it in just the right places to order a show. If a dog can do that, imagine what a child could do.  Somewhat related to the above point, there is no power off option. There is \"Sleep\" and \"Restart\" but that's about it.
