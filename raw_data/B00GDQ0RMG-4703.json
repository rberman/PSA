For example the ESPN app will not show any videos without first asking for my cable provider even though you can watch free videos on the ESPN website.  I also wish there were more apps like the Roku stick has.  Other than that I enjoy having features such as Netflix to easily access.  I look forward to the addition of new applications in the future.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "A great little way of watching Amazon videos on the tv.  Searching is fine although not as easy as using a laptop and amazon.com.  Additional channels are available too for watching and gathering a wide range of information.  These all get you closer to not needing that $$$ cable service; Ahh.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Searcher"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This Fire TV Stick is so easy to use and has an excellent variety/selection of movies you can choose to watch.
