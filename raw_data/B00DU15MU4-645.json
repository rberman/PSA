It's tiny, and packs lots of functionality.Video Load Speed===============My previous solution (Amazon App on my Sony BD player) took forever to buffer and figure out the available bandwidth. With the Fire TV, the shows are pre-queued, and start instantaneously - WE LOVE IT!Apps & Games============We mostly use it to - surprise, surprise - watch videos.However, when you want to watch content from sources other than Amazon you need apps, and this little thing delivers!I installed some of the free games, but I'm looking forward to buying a controller and getting some paid games.I also installed (side loaded) Kodi on this for access to the media I have on me home server. This thingController========The controller is simple and elegant. One of the things I absolutely love about it is that it's RF and not IR. If you are like me and have a projector with a media cabinet in the back of the room you would LOVE this. No more pointing the remote backwards :) And it also works if you're cozying up under a blanket.The remote has only 6 buttons, and a directional pad with a selection button in the middle (ok, so technically 7 buttons and a ring-pad), but it turns out that this is all you need - no more fishing for the right button on the remote.I also love the voice search feature. Speech recognition is working great, and it sure beats the alternative (even the wireless keyboard I have attached to the box).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shy Cohen"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I got a fire box with prime in June 2014 and cut my cable. Loved that part. Enjoyed prime video. But there is nothing (much) new on prime tv since April of last year. Worst of all, fire tv only works well with prime content. It freezes on Hulu plus, it freezes on pbs. Prime support has me unplugging my box multiple times in the space of an hour. That's fun/not. Since there is nothing new on prime, there is not much reason to have fire tv, prime, and kindle fire devices.  I don't have this problem with my older roku box. Roku just plays everything, no problem. Thank god I didn't commit to a fire phone as well. I was hoping to be able to use all Amazon electronics to synch usage easily. Instead I am thinking I need to trash all my Amazon equip and buy anew.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Appliancequeen"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I've had this device for about 6 months now. I also have owned an Apple TV for 2 years. If I could post a venn diagram here, I would. I like many features of the FireTV but obviously the downside is the lack of integration with my Apple \"ecosystem\". Yeah, I'm one of those hipsters who owns all \"iDevices\".  Also, the apps can be dodgy malfunction randomly.Pros:- Amazon Prime has some good programming and free movies, rentals are pretty reasonably priced- Picture quality is great- Voice search- Has HBO, Showtime, Hulu apps- Price is lowCons:- Remote lacks RF (?) so I can't program it to my Logitech Harmony remote- No remote app for iPhone. The AppleTV remote app allows you to type what you're searching for rather than pecking. While FireTV has voice search, it is only applicable to Prime; not for Netflix or other streaming apps.- No easy way to restart the device- Several times I have had to uninstall apps (Netflix, HBO) and re-install. Netflix sometimes won't play titles at all. Also, I've had to activate HBO several times for no reason. This means I have to go on the computer and pull up the activation site and input my cable info then the code blah blah blah...- No youtube app- No Airplay like featureI'm sure there is more for each category but I can't recall right now. Overall, as I said, I do like this device and I will keep it for a while longer. I'm hoping they at least develop a smart phone app for the remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Bungle"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "This device is very rudimentary.  I've had the Roku 3 for a year and a half now and it runs circles around Amazon Fire TV.  The interface for Amazon it's okay, the speed is much slower than what I am accustomed to with Roku.But most infuriating is the search feature.  Amazon touts its voice search feature which is nice but very one-sided. It only gives search results for Amazon streaming. Which I find irritating. I do not like having options forced down my throat.  I am an avid Amazon shopper but this self promoting tactic is unacceptable. Amazon put your customers needs first.  Roku provides a variety streaming services with pricing.  The Amazon Netflix search engine was a joke. It took me all of 30 minutes to decide that Amazon needs to go back to the drawing board. Amazon Fire will be returned to Best Buy first thing tomorrow.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/6", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Not as robust as advertised.

Did everything we expected and was very simple to set up. After a two months I noticed that on Amazon Prime content the device will stop streaming and a yellow sign that states we have no internet service comes on screen. This is followed by looking for service, rating it very good, returning home, back to selected content and back to the yellow sign.
