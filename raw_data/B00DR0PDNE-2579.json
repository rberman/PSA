[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I wanted another smart tv without having to buy another set.  Chromecast is the perfect solution.  It works beautifully.  I look forward to the day more options become available.  Knowing the power of Google the wait should not be that long.  Another plus is that the device is portable and can be used on any TV in the house with a HDMI port.Chromecast is easy to set up and easy to use.  So much so that I didn't have to \"consult\" with my 20 something sons for help.

Hell, I can do this with an HDMI wireless device and stream anything that is on my screen. I thought that this would have the HBO Go app built in where I could simply stream through this unit but found out that I still have to stream from my laptop which I was doing with an HDMI cable to begin with.

Only feature it had was it was able to tell you the weather, stocks and news when and Ethernet cable was plugged in. I upgraded to a newer Samsung Smart Tv but I still wanted to use my other samsung. Buying this Chromecast did the trick and it now streams everything just as great as my new Smart Tv. Dumb Tv now turned Smart. :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "MR J \"MrJ\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great service I will order through them again.

Plex seems to work the best, and will eventually be free, but currently requires a subscription to their premium service.As an aside, if you plan to use this through a vpn, it won't work unless you're using a vpn router. I found this out the hard way when I brought mine to China. However, that was due to my own lack of research so I'm not holding that against Google.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Horatio M. Smithee"}]
