Aesthetically it was great.  The remote is nice and easy to use.  Cheap at $19.However, minus the original setup, I have had nothing but issues with connecting to my wi-fi, maintaining the connection, and using the connection to stream.  I bought the stick with the intention of watching watchespn in a room with no cable box.  This was going to replace the chromecast which has worked flawlessly, but required me to either use my phone or laptop to cast watchespn over.  At no point was I able to watch for more than 5 minutes without having an issue.Discussing with tech support got no better results.  Read some reviews, and this appears to be a repetitive issue.I will be returning it and not purchasing it again in the future.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/6", "author": "DG"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very nice little device for Amazon prime members!* Setup is a little slow ~ 15 minutes but it's worth waiting* you can sideload other apps(just google it) in addition to your some amazon apps* shows streams very fast (except for youtube app)* miracast works well for kindle fire tablet (Surface pro's connection not very stable)* interface is simple enough to navigate", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Matt"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "So far it's three stars: I pre-ordered close to day one of availability, and received it today (Nov 26), so it's basically brand new.

I bought this since I couldnt watch my Amazon Prime Video through chrome cast to my TV.  Works great and love the little remote that comes with - also can use my phone ( android) as a remote as well through the app. I will use with my Netflix accounts.  There is also an option to stream music or view photos too! Looks like you can play apps & games as well but I wll use it most for Movie & Prime Tv - now just need another season Transparent to come out - I watched that way too fast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "JX3"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Got my Fire TV Stick on Nov. 24th.  I like the overall interface.  The UI is responsive.  However, I purchased two of these sticks to use primarily as a Plex client.  It doesn't support directplay for mkv files and the transcoded content stutters intermittently during playback.  I almost always get initial stuttering at the beginning and then sometimes it will stutter in the middle of the content I'm viewing.  I've tried both the 2.4Ghz & 5Ghz wifi bands.  Plugged it in directly to the wall instead of using my TV's usb as well.  My router is less than 5 feet away too.I have both chromecast and roku sticks as well and have no problems streaming .mkv files through Plex on those sticks.  So if you're getting this for Plex streaming - you will probably be disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "A. Tran"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I just received the Fire TV stick yesterday. My initial thought was how well it was put together in the box, and how clear the instructions are. I own the Google Chromecast; its a completely different device in its entirety, but it's still connected the same way into your TV. Plug the device into your HDMI output on your HDTV, and the start-up menu comes up immediately. The start-up time is very fast considering its size and internal components. The included remote is a very huge plus for me. The navigation through the menus is fast, simple, and easy. There's really not much else to say knowing that it's a media player, but it's completely different from any other. Buy it, and you won't be disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Ethan Davis"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I was one of the fortunate prime members who purchased their Fire TV Stick at only $19 for the pre-order sale. I was also fortunate enough to receive it  2 weeks before the expected delivery date of December 1st.I haven't had this long enough to give an extensive review, but here are my thoughts from the get go.PACKAGING:Everything was well protected and compact.It comes with the Fire TV Stick, Remote, USB Cable plus the Power Adapter, an HDMI extender cable, and the batteries needed for the remote.SETUP:This was by far the easiest set up to any streaming device I've ever had. You literally just plug the stick into the HDMI port on your TV, and Plug it into the outlet, and it starts right up.Once I connected to my wifi, it did go thru the set up of downloading the latest software.Since it is an amazon product, it was already set up with my amazon prime account, and I liked that amazon was the \"Home\" page, so I didn't have to necessarily go to an amazon app like other streaming devices to enjoy my prime content.You can easily download Netflix, HuluPlus, Crackle to your list of apps and there are others, that I have yet to explore.I'm interested to see if the Fire TV Stick can play my NBA League Pass.I'll update the review in a month, when I've had more time to mess around with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "4/4", "author": "LizJean24"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Generally I'm very happy with this device. Two criticisms, or maybe more like one criticism and one semi-criticism:*The remote does not consistently move through the interface smoothly. It will get stopped up, not respond, you click right/left/up/down again and then suddenly it plays catch-up. It will also sometimes scroll across an entire screen just from quickly pressing a direction once. This has already frustrated me a number of times.*I really wish that Amazon would stop trying to insulate themselves from the Google universe. This device has better YouTube functionality than the Kindle does, so that's something, but voice searches only bring up Amazon-specific hits. I understand it from a business perspective, but as a consumer it limits the experience.Again though, generally this thing does the job well, and is really good value for a low price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Leif Johnson"}]
