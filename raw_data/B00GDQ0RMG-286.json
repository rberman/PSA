[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "After spending several days reading reviews on various streaming media players for my family (single mom with a 12 and 7 year old), I decided the Fire stick was the device for me.  I have not been disappointed!  Upon initial start-up I did have to go into Settings and choose to update in order for the Netflix and Sling apps to work.  Once I did, everything has worked smoothly.  Transitioning between various apps is seamless.  I was a little worried about the size of the remote and whether my son would have difficulty using it...I'm not sure what I was thinking.  Of course, at 7, he had NO problem!  I am planning to get the controller remote also, since he does play some games on there.  I am a Prime member, and I use Amazon music a lot, so this works really well for me!  I love the Amazon music playlists...so whatever I'm in the mood for, I can stream through the TV...WITH lyrics.  If I was inclined to have a karaoke party in my living room, I could!I chose not to get the Fire TV because it would not have made much of a difference for me based upon my current internet connection.  The Chromecast was a no go, because it lacked an actual remote.  I thought about a Roku but the reviews for the speed and content available for such a portable device as the Fire Stick seemed like a no-brainer.  Better yet, I can take it with me while visiting family and plug it in and access my stuff.  Perfect!  I highly recommend!!The one negative is that Amazon does not carry Kodi in the app store.  I'm pretty disappointed about that.For comparison, I have used the following for my streaming media:  Wii, Raspberry Pi, Apple TV and years ago some generic box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Melissa C.

I had it for about a week. It is really easy to use. My kids use it all the time to watch their shows and play games. Prime is a good option to have with this product. No complains for far.
