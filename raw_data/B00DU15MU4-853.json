It's just amazing with all you can watch and not to forget the games you can play for free or purchase. For under $10.00 a month you have endless entertainment with movies, TV episodes, radio, and gaming. I love all the free apps and the screen savors. I was just so impressed. You cannot go wrong purchasing Amazon Prime TV. Now watching TV has completely changed. Thank you Amazon!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rick L.

You'll never hear the words -in your house again- that there's nothing to watch on TV.
