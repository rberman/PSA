Good value too because it includes all the same apps & much more than Apple TV, for a cheaper price.  Additionally, you also get access to Prime Instant Video with your Prime membership so you have access to thousands of shows, movies, etc.  I would recommend this over the Google Chromecast or Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "BIGski0202 \"BIGski0202\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really like the Fire TV Stick.  It's easy to use and I also have access to my Netflix account on it.  My only complaint is the volume of the advertisements between TV show episodes.  When they play they are extremely loud compared to volume of the show, I mean really loud.  It's quite annoying.  Fix that and you'll get 5 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Christine Engleman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was a gift from a thoughtful daughter!
