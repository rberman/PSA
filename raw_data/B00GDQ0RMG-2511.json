Apple, Chromecast, and Roku. Of them all I really like this one. Biggest reason I bought this one was the advertised feature whereby you can use this in hotels with guest wireless that requires a login. Haven't had a chance to try this yet but feedback from others is this works great. Needs more apps to fully compete with Apple TV and Roku but if you want a small form factor with good steaming, travel, and or are a Prime member this device is fantastic and at a great price point.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rob T"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Constantly resets, does not save personal login info for more than a few days and sometimes take a few minutes just to boot up.
