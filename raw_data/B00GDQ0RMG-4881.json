[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Its nice but wireless signal is a bit weak! Bought it as a gift for my parents and their bedroom was upstairs directly above the room with internet modem, and it would not connect at all. Luckily I already owned a Roku device which worked just fine, but I am still on the fence about it. Overall its beautifully designed, and as weird as it sounds I love the high definition screen savers!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bookworm1984"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Can't get it to work.

I had somewhat of a skeptical view of it as we already had Netflix and other options and wasn't sure how it would fit in everything. I was surprised how easy it was to setup and use. I use it routinely now and I have found the navigation to be simple and the interface rather handy. The best part of course it is already tied to my Amazon Prime account and there was a surprising amount of free content as well as a good selection of content to rent or purchase.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Barry McDarby"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i haven't had it very long, but when we used it it worked very well", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Barry Blaine"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "What crappy wireless network in this thing. always gets disconnected from WiFi.
