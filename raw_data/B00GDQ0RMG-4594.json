It regularly drops WiFi signal and then enters a loop where it cannot locate the router...which is at most three feet away. Only way I have found to correct the problem is to physically remove the stick and then plug it back in. Kind of a pain when something is plugged in behind your TV. The price was great but the product doesn't live up to expectations.
