Come on if I am going to pay for slots, then I am going to play on casinos !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "dan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very nice", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "bonnie padgett"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I am happy with this purchase.

I love how it connects to everything that we stream to and the size of the connecting device.  I do not like how it disconnects to the internet (1-3 times a week) and you have to manually unplug the device in order to reconnect it.  I attempted to do it using the remote but it would only reconnect using this method.  I also think that the remote is a little bit too small.  We lose it all of the time, it blends in very easily with what we have in our house.  I also don't like how when you have on the parent settings when watching a tv show on amazon prime that is free that you have to put in the code each time that you go back to watch it.  I feel as though you should only have to put it in the first time for free prime videos.  Other than that I enjoy it and it works for our family.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Julie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it ... fast processor. ..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mitchell Moyers"}]
