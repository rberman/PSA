Problem: I'm out of HDMI ports on my TV (You don't have game consoles and a bluray player?). So I had to swap out the Chromecast, which I was using for YouTube and Netflix. For such a low-priced item, I can't believe it really pays to make us all have to buy every content provider's unique device. Will y'all cut that out?I already had Amazon Prime. And I was watching it on my TV and/or Bluray player. So why get this at all? I like Amazon Prime Music. I use the Android, Windows, and OSX apps (mobile, at home, at work) are all great. But there still isn't an option to play my music back at home on my nice TV/Entertainment sound system. And you continue to stubbornly refuse to support Chromecast. The collateral all says this supports Music, so I thought this would be the solution.The Music app, which is the only thing I got this for, is terrible. Search doesn't work. I was forced to scroll through hundreds of albums to find what I wanted to play -- and I won't be doing that again. Yes, I tried the mobile app, and it was pretty useless for this also.My recommendation: stop publicising this as supporting Prime Music, and make the Prime Music apps (which are pretty good) support Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Chris Westin"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Would love hbo go.

It now works very well with no interruptions and is located 30 feet and through two walls to reach the wireless router. The other reviews solved my problems.

The Fire TV Stick is truly awesome. I love how I can watch anything I purchase with through my Amazon Prime membership on any of my TVs in my home, no matter where I am at. I can also watch it on other portable formats as well. Great going Amazon. The Fire TV Stick is well worth every cent spent on this product.

Its great for Prime customers. I would give it 5 stars but the instruction are bad at worse, and there is no way to stream in quality less then HD. HD eats up the bandwidth.
