I jumped on it at that price because we were looking for streaming device for our second TV. I'm blow away by the quality of this product. Here's my review.Responsible, Sustainable Product Packaging:It came in a cardboard box that looked like it had been designed by a sustainable designer for a watch or jewelry. The only plastic used in packaging was the thin transparent bags that exactly fit the charger, the dongle and the remote. Everything else was arranged in its place in the cardboard box. For those of you who are interested in responsible product packaging - this is one to learn from. Job well done, Amazon.Pros:It's easy to assemble, and install. We had it up in 10 minutes. We also have a Roku. Everything we already watch on the Roku we can also watch on this device, but now on our other TV.Picture quality is excellent. The number of apps available is pretty decent. We installed the Youtube app right away. Amazon prime movies look great on the TV. Many of the other apps we've installed on Fire TV Stick are well designed. Smithsonian Channel is breathtaking. Changing between menus is easy and intuitive through out. If you have and like you're Roku 3, you'll find this interface familiar and easy to manage.The included remote is simple and intuitive. You can download the android app for your own phone or tablet to make entering choices a lot easier, too.We've had it for a few days now and are well pleased. Prime movies are a snap.This is not a Chromecast. You don't have to have a computer or tablet on in order to view things streamed via your computer. Yet if you want to stream a particular Youtube video to your television, you can with this device from your computer, phone or tablet.Cons:The Fire TV Stick is set up to encourage its owners to view Amazon's videos. If you don't have Amazon prime, it could make you a bit frustrated that the first thing you always see is a bunch of movies you're probably never going to watch. If you *have* Amazon Prime, your experience will be pretty enjoyable. Roku is a little more subtle about it. You can arrange your channels (Amazon calls them apps) right at the top of your home page on Roku. Not so much with Amazon Fire TV Stick. If it doesn't appear on the \"recent\" menu, you'll have to dig down into the menu nest to find your preferred channels (like YouTube or Smithsonian.)The Second criticism I have is for the lack of an aggregate news feed. Roku has a news aggregator that is part of its interface and not an app, so you can click one button to check out the headlines from multiple news sources while you're shaving or dressing for work. Amazon doesn't have an included aggregate news feed, but instead relies on apps that are from separate news outlets. You watch one clip and it stops. Then you have to click another news clip. If you want a more rounded news experience, you have to manually go between apps to find news. It's not as convenient as Roku's aggregate feed, where you'll get about fifteen to twenty minutes of clips from multiple news outlets. How about it, Amazon?Overall:If price is no object, a Roku 3 is still hard to beat. If you're a Prime Movie and TV fan, you'll enjoy using this device. We have prime, so it's a working solution for us.Edit 2015.01.27:I will offer one peeve that has cropped up. For the FireTV apps (PBS, for example), search function has to happen through the remote. If you're looking for \"Grantchester\", you'll have to wiggle up and down that crummy interface on the FireTV with the little remote. You can't type it in from your Android-enabled remote app. You can't speak it in from there either. The android-enabled remote app has either been hampered on purpose, or poorly designed. Amazon - please fix this. Intentionally hampering a reasonable user experience is beneath you.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Laughter on Water"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "The Fire Stick didn't work on two tvs so I ordered a replacement. Replacement didn't work either. I couldn't get past the Amazon logo/blank screen. I tried the stick on a small tv in a bedroom and I was able to get to the start screen. The remote wouldn't let me proceed (I used new batteries) so I gave up and will return everything tomorrow. Clearly this device isn't compatible with all tvs and it would have been nice to know before I wasted so much time. I'm very disappointed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "A.

I helped her set it up, and here is my experience.My mom couldn't figure out a chromecast, how to use the DVD players Netflix hulu stuff, or the Xbox ones navigation. So when I bought the Fire TV stick, and showed her how to use it, I didn't expect she would be able to use it with such ease. But she can!My mom is not very computer savvy or tech savvy at all. The ease of use of this is the best thing ever. She likes the fact she can rent, or buy movies from amazon. She also likes how she can log onto netflix, or hulu plus with ease. She also recently downloaded crackle on it, and likes how she can watch movies for free. (they have commercials)The plug: The HDMI plug goes into the TV. It does require a part of it to plug into a wall outlet. I found the cord to be not that long. Also found out that if you use other extension micro USB cords it might not work right.The remote: The remove is basic. It has a back button, home, back, forward, and play button. Its easy to navigate.Navigation: The simple navigation is probably what makes this the best media navigator. It literally connects all your services into one, and makes it easy to use.Only issue: I had an older TV that at first had issues recognizing it was plugged in. I had to play around with it for a few minutes to get it to work. Just move the D pad part around and it will come up, as long as your on the right HDMI channel.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "robert"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I installed it without a hitch and had a problem with installing some apps.
