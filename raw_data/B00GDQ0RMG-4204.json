I still don\"t know if I'm keeping it.  My HDMI is in the back of my plasma and even with theextender the stick does not stick out very far.  I could not figure out why I couldn't get it to work for the longest time!  All the new electronics Ihave the signal bounces around and connects and this thing bounced but was so slow it was CRAZY!  If your HDMI is in the back DO NOTBUY IT.  I have it taped so it barely sticks out.  If you have Amazon prime you'll get more use out of it than I am.  I mainly bought it for Netflixbut since its slow I don't know if I'll keep it. If you do want this device e prepared to wait.  Amazon is always fast with my deliveries, but itwill take awhile to get this device.  I waited almost 3 weeks, which is unheard of for Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "3/4", "author": "Amazon buyer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is amazing!!! I love it!

Much to my dismay and contrary to all of the advertised images, this thumb-drive-sized unit must be plugged into AC power in order to work. If I had known that, I'd likely have opted for the larger but more versatile Fire a TV or another Apple TV unit. That said, it performs well. It is faster than my Apple TV, just not as versatile.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Michael S."}]
