It's great that it allows me access to my Amazon music lists, Amazon video,etc.  But it has some serious flaws.  Apple TV is way better so far.For starters, it's a little glitch.  Sometimes Amazon music just hangs and hangs and won't let me do anything.  Sometimes the video streaming also gets hung up.  And it is NOT my wifi network.  I have 3 networks in the house, and this one is running on a fast 5 ghz network, which is not competing with any other computers in the house, connected to a 50 gbps cable connection.When it does hang, there is no easy way to reboot it from a menu.  I have to unplug the power cord from the wall to do a reboot.The single most annoying thing though, is the parental controls.  With Apple TV, I can restrict content by rating, however if I want to watch something that's rated R, all I have to do is enter my code and it will play.  With the Fire TV stick (and I'm guessing with the regular Fire TV), if I have Amazon Video restricted (there's no option for restricting by content, it's either on or off) you have to back out into the settings and turn parental controls off, then go back into Amazon Video and find your video.  Why the hell can't I just enter the code to bypass the parental controls for that 1 video instead of having to turn parental controls off first?They seriously need to update the software.  Apple TV is way better at this point.  I have both, and really only got the Fire TV stick for Amazon Video and music, but at this point I'm better off just streaming from my ipad to the Apple TV over airplay.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.

Expected a true plug and play device and it didn't work.  Until we got FireTVStick I would stream movies from my unlimited data plan hotspot on phone through computer to the TV...thought firestick would streamline process and possibly speed it up...nope.  Spent three hours trying to get it to connect, tried with three different phones with two different providers and while it would get to the point of allowing password it would never make connection, it was never recognized on phone.  I am hoping it is a defective device...sending it back to Amazon.  If a second one doesn't work I will just give up and continue to use the computer hooked up to the TV and stream tv through the phone as I have been doing....bulky but it works.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "REALIST"}]
