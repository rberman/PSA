Simple installation process, although I had to try it twice .  A lot of Apps options to choose from. Beautiful interface. Performance is good.

After a call to customer support who told us to turn off tv and restart installation it started updating.  This occurs each time you use Fire TV and it works great.  It is worth $25.00 paid at Best Buy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lori"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I've got the full spread of streaming devices - AppleTV, Roku Stick, Chromecast and now Fire TV stick.  I've also got a Samsung TV with SmartHUB  (I'll eventually get a GoogleTV to compare)  Why all this madness?  Trying to find the one unit that will cover everything that I need to do, the CPU horsepower to handle some encoding and with an excellent easy to use UI.It can be a little confusing on how to add extra apps to the list, but once there, everything else fits rather seamlessly together.  Search can be a bit confusing and it's not cross app like it is in SmartHUB or ROKU, it only returns results from Prime.  Within an app like Netflix, you can't use the voice search, it tosses you out back to the primary Amazon search.Basically at this time, I would say this is the best device for folks living in the Amazon ecosphere - their integration for Prime subscribers is top notch.  The UI for their playback system is great and watching a TV series it will move through a season for you automatically reducing the amount of steps you may have to go through.  The interface is snappy, and though I have not tried any games yet, it is one of the selling points.This has been the most capable in terms of compatibility for minimizing the need for transcoding streams with PLEX.I do recommend plugging in the USB power supply, it will prevent any start-up pause as the stick initializes.  On my TV, when this happens the TV switches the input to it, which is annoying.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "NewJerseyDan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got a good deal and it works really well. For the price it is definitely worth it if you're looking for something simple to run Netflix and Hulu. The only gripe I have is the text on the user interface is a bit small. I have a hard time seeing it from across the room and I don't wear glasses. I think older people would have a problem with that unless they have a big TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J. Leopold"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it. Don't have to turn on the xbox to watch  youtube, or netflix or amazon prime anymore.  I did have some issues with the updates, took longer than I expected. (about 30 min) had to also unplug it a couple times I guess to reboot it.  But after that works great!  Do wish they made the plug a little longer.  The remote could have a few more functions that would be a plus. But in all a great item!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "frank"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I finally received my Fire TV Stick in the mail last night and needless to say I was pretty excited.  Amazon did a nice job with the packaging and nothing was overly packaged or protected or wrapped in excessive cellophanes or Styrofoam.  The pieces were very easy to make sense out of.  The batteries go in the remote, the USB cord plugs into the power brick and the Fire Stick and the Fire Stick plugs into your TV.  Easy peasy... wrong.My plan was to use this in our bedroom to replace an outdated and ugly UI streaming box we've had for a couple of years now.  The TV is smaller and older in the bedroom, so I used the HDMI extender to make things a little easier on my self for accessibility.  I plugged everything in and the Fire stick booted right up, connected to the remote and searched for wifi networks without a hitch.I must have tried both my 2.4 and 5G networks about a dozen times each, always failing to connect.  I rebooted and refreshed, watched the stupid how-to videos on Amazon and went through all the troubleshooting guides.  Nothing worked.  I set up with the same configuration out in the living room, so I was closer to my router with better reception.  Still nothing.  I removed the HDMI extender feeling it was unnecessary at this point and thinking it had something to do with my ridiculously complicated wifi password, I set up a simple guest 5G network with no password.  BAM, PRESTO, it works.  WTF.So now I run the updates and register and watch the stupid video you can't skip through and I get to my home screen with tons of media to watch.  I think okay, it's working, let's set it back up in the bedroom.  I put back the HDMI extender and plug everything in and now my home screen is just a spinning wheel.  It lost the wifi connection, but how.  The Fire TV Stick holds the wifi info in it's memory and automagically reconnects when that network is present.  Our phones, tablets and old crappy streaming box could connect just fine in the bedroom and now this brand new piece of equipment can't reconnect to a single-user 5G guest network I just set up... hmmm.For s***s and giggles and remove the HDMI extender and plug the TV Stick directly into my TV.  Guess what?  It works now.It seems that somehow, using the HDMI extender inhibited the wifi reception so bad that no matter how close I was to my router (within 10ft) it wouldn't let the Fire TV Stick connect to the wifi network.A 5 minute setup ended up taking about 4 hours of random troubleshooting.  There's not much content in the way of help forums for this product yet, so I hope this review might help others in the future.  I'm still giving 3 stars because once it works, it works pretty well.  Small compact size and user friendly interface.That's my story and I'm \"Stick\"-ing to it.  Good luck and happy streaming!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/6", "author": "Michael"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Update after 9 months:I'm still impressed with what this little gizmo can do at a low price, but after using it very consistently for 9 months, we've noticed the Fire TV Stick's WiFi isn't as reliable as our Apple TV.  Especially with Netflix, we have a lot of times where it stops mid-size to load. Occasionally it drops the connection completely and I have to reboot the system. Our Apple TV never has that issue. So I took a star back for WiFi connectivity but overall I still recommend this.------------------------------------------------I'm so happy with the Fire TV stick!!  We have an Apple TV, Chromecast and this.  I hate the Chromecast and it's currently sitting in a drawer.  We use the Apple TV entirely for streaming (Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Disney JR, and a few others) and I was hoping this would cover that job.  It definitely does for a fraction of the price. My only gripe is that they try (like the Chromecast ads) to make it appear like it doesn't have a power cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "snowfire555"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is the very best  technology item I've purchased.  I received my Fire TV Stick just yesterday, popped it into my Samsung TV, and while I had a few moments of it not connecting correctly:  #1-I had to literally unplug my Samsung blue ray player because it seemed to prohibit me from accessing the Fire TV Stick. #2-I also disconnected it from the HDMI extender cable.In any case, it was so very much worth the minor glitch in my systems.  The remote control is super easy to use, and I was hugely impressed with the speed by which everything is accessed.  I am a Prime member, however I had to log in with my username  (it should have been automatic.) No big deal with Fire TV Stick - the scrolling with the remote is UBER fast and efficient (they've even included @gmail and @yahoo on the keyboard!)It's awesome and so very easy to use. My husband is absolutely useless (self-proclaimed) with technology, and after his protests at watching the Excellent introductory video with the  Fire TV Stick, he was totally in control of the system.  Ah yes, another remote control I won't have access to.  But it's really THAT easy.Included are lots of apps for TV, Movies, Music and Games.  We don't have small children, however I could easily see the value of getting the game controller (sold separately) and have the kids use Prime games, one stop shopping - it's fantastic really.I was smart and lucky enough to purchase this early at a discounted price, however I'd pay the full price for another one.  It's THAT good.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "TE"}]
