So far the Fire Stick has allowed us to download all the apps we've wanted so we can watch movies, listen to music, or play some games when we have some time.I was able to install the Fire Sticks to my TVs with ease and supply them power and still keep them hidden behind the screen so you don't see any ugly cables.
