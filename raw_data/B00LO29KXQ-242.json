I have found that they only seem to work if you are practically sitting on top of a wireless router.  If you are attempting to utilize the Fire Stick in any other room aside from the room where your router is located, the Fire Stick will not work.  It always tells me that I'm connected to my wireless network (which has excellent signal, by the way), but \"with problems\".  No matter how often I restart the device, it always states that I'm connected \"with problems\" and will not load.  I have had the same issue using both cable internet and with DSL.  These Fire Sticks are completely useless, and I regret buying two of them.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Peaches"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wonderful product...great value!

I came across this Fire Stick and thought it might work. I am 63 years old, disabled and live alone so was hopeful that it would be as easy to install as stated. I opened box, put stick in HDMI slot then followed directions on the screen and it worked immediately. Unbelievably easy. The hardest part for me was getting the remote open with my arthritis to get the batteries in. Amazon Prime movies worked great but I couldn't get Netflix to do anything but buffer. I was quite unhappy but felt that it was still worth the price to just watch my Amazon movies. But, I went online and read the Amazon forum on the subject of Netflix and there was a solution posted by a man who said that the Amazon techs suggested how to fix it. I went back to my room, followed the instructions and Voila.....Netflix now works perfectly. I absolutely LOVE my Amazon Fire Stick and highly recommend it to everyone. I just wish I had bought it a long time ago.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This TV stick is pretty cool. I can install apps as I want and watch videos within the apps. I can search videos on my phone/tablet in YOUTUBE and cast it to TV. That's really convenient! No need to connect my laptop to TV to watch videos.However, the specs are so low that everything is slow on it. It takes minutes to load apps and apps crash a lot.The default launcher is not friendly to load user apps. You can install the wukong tv remote on tv stick and your android phone. after that, you can open apps installed on tv stick from the phone easily. I also installed a third part launcher on the stick. each time I turn on the tv/stick, the launcher will open automatically after the default launcher is opened. the third part launcher is much more enjoyable to access apps on the tv stick.I love the TV stick but it needs a lot improvement though, especially in the hardware specs.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jenny"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice system. Traded in my Roku. My Roku kept freezing so decided to try the Fire stick. First took off one star and maybe this is my own fault also. Took me awhile to figure out the remote and instructions were not helpful. But, after got that figured out the amazon stick is a great little media streaming device. Easy setup, then added all my apps, very quick response time and loads my netfix shows in just a couple of seconds. Easy navigation. All in all very worth the 39.00. By the way, the remote circle is not like a ipod. You just click n,s,e,w. Not in a circle. : )", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. Hall \"Voyager\""}]
