The YouTube app for Fire is a third party app and should not be confused with the genuine YouTube app you would find on your phone, smart tv's, and blu-ray players.  The menus on the fire stick could be better and do not buy this for the games as that falls short too.  The android app needs some work for this device, but at least it does have an app to help you with navigation and typing in searches.  The Plex app is currently free and works fairly well with streaming your own video content.  Hulu Plus and Netflix work well, too.Overall, Amazon would have done better if they had focused on presenting a good quality media player with a user defined menu system, instead we are given a device who's obvious purpose is to push anything it can sell you on Amazon.  If you got this for $19 like I did, it a nice deal.  For $39, keep you eye on updates and read more reviews before you decide or look at the the full size box streamers, including the Amazon Fire TV box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "C.

Just read the onestar reviews. I ordered mine for $19 and it came a week ago. Just now hooking it up and enjoying a Suits marathon. No problems at all, I love this thing more than apps on my TiVo, my PCH A100, Boxee Box (hacked), Chromecast, or Android stick(XBMC). Haven't tried Netflix or any other apps yet,will update when appropriate. It just works and has a remote.

Ergonomically the USB power connector caused some difficulty as it interfered with other nearby connectors. Chromecast (which is not a functional equivalent) has an HDMI extender to help with this.
