[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Not being a \"technologically savvy\" person, we literally plugged this in and it worked. THE FIRE TV STICK is FANTASTIC! \"It is EXCELLENT, FUN AND WELL WORTH THE MONEY' my husband is quoted as saying. Just watched an entire series of Bosch that would have cost more if we had rented one video at a time.

Especially love the phone app that let's you search via voice which is highly accurate. Tried John Wayne and it immediately came up with 100 different shows. Also don't have to try to find items we watch constantly, just tell it to search for Glades or Downtown Abbey and it pops right up. Best $40 we have spent lately.
