I give it 4 instead of 5 stars for two reasons:1) It only has HDMI out and no separate audio out.  So you're basically forced to use the substandard speakers that come with tv's unless you buy a device to strip out the audio like this:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G9FDJNA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_152) This guy seems to use a lot of power as it heats up a good bit.  It has to be powered by a separate source as the HDMI won't power it. So you have an additional, awkward cord to deal with.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Clinton Smith"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a great HDMI dongle and that it is powered by Chrome OS and able to stream is even more awesome.Just connect it to a wifi and follow the steps and then let it go to work.
