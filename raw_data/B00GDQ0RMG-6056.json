Biggest downfall is the music. Can only play Amazon music. And getting that set up is a pain. No pandora, slacker, iheartradio, etc.Update: Found Pandora, iheartradio, etc.  They are listed under apps.  Not categorized under music.  So, while I do have access to them, it's not intuitive to find.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "ladydi2196"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "We ordered two of these when they were a special for $19 each. We received them about 2 weeks before the first estimated delivery date. We have a 37\" vizio up in our room, and that is where we plugged the first one in at. It flashed the word \"amazon\" and did nothing after, at one point it said \"no support\"! We were disappointed. We have a 55\" vizio in our living room, where we plugged in the second one. This one worked just fine! Everything updated and started like it's supposed to!As we were brainstorming about the one we had on the 37\", I thought about the resolution on the stick needing to be turned down. So we took that one and plugged in into the 55\", lo and behold it worked like it's supposed to! So, I did all the updates there, and in the settings turned it down from 1080p to 780p. Then we went back upstairs, and plugged it back into the 37\", and what do ya know IT WORKED!If you are having display problems, plug it into another TV and turn down the resolution. Chances are, that will fix it! Now that they both work, I have been happy. It was just a lot of trial and error to figure out what the issue was in the first place.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "JennyF"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far I'm finding the Fire TV Stick much easier to use for navigation of the Prime site. It was easy to setup and its download speeds seem pretty quick using a cable modem network.The primary reason I bought it was that my Sony BluRay player made it difficult to access and search for movies and shows. Plus I bought it during the sale period, so couldn't go wrong!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Stephen Szymanski"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Fantastic device! Excellent quality in the device itself as well as playback video and audio quality. Very customizable, and the remote is perfect. I will gladly add a fifth start when support for new apps are added (Google play movies, Netflix, Bush, Crackle, etc.). I have a chromed, too, and would like to have one device that covers my apps instead of having to switch back and forth.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "E.

Boots quickly and downloads and streams start with minimal delay. That's especially impressive considering my ISP is DSL. I prefer the Fire TV experience to that of X Box live and Apple TV.
