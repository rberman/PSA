It also comes with a few instructional videos to guide you through how to do things. I love that I don't have to watch Netflix on my iPad anymore, or even YouTube videos! Also, if you're an Amazon Prime member, you can add things to your watchlist directly from this. I definitely recommend this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jen"}]
