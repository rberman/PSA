[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great!  Used these to build out a cheap wi-fi home audio system: I connected a google chromecast in to a Panlong HDMI audio extractor (available on amazon) for each \"zone\", then the output from each went in to amplifier, and then amplifier output for each went to my in-ceiling speakers.  Worked like a charm, now I have wifi-controlled audio in every room at 1/10th the cost of Sonos :)Only downside is I had to buy a clunky app on Android to play my MP3s from my phone (3.99) and/or play music from my computer via the chrome browser and google play music.  Hopefully Android integration will get a bit better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Igor Tsirlin"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I use Chromecast primarily for streaming movies for my kids from Netflix.  They each get an hour a day to play with the iPad, but I did not like the fact that they kept the tablet so close to their eyes.  Now, they choose a movie and in 5 seconds it plays on our TV.  It streams well and the HD quality is amazing!  I also really like the fact that is so small, but my TV does not have a USB port, so I have to provide power for a nearby power strip.My wireless router is about 50 feet away and the signal must travel through several walls in my house.  So, I purchased a repeater from Costco for $80 and now my wireless signal is 10X stronger.  The best $35 I've ever spent!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Jorge Leiva"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Works we'll enough for Netflix . But, I got it in the hopes I could watch tv shows I missed and it does not work at all for that. I am using a new Dell computer and a fast network and all I get is a frozen tv screen.

Chrome browser dos not even play mp4 or avi videos. Even when you project (cast) Google's own YouTube videos they are jittery  with sound out of sync with the video and are not capable of watching.  I switched to Intel's free  WiDi software, using a Belkin video adapter. It works perfect. I use ASUS N56V i7 laptop which I also purchased on Amazon along with the Belkin.  Chrome cast cannot project (duplicate) your PC's screen and it does not work like a second monitor with sound, like the Intel WiDi does. This product simply does not work as advertised and should have not been released. Shame on Google programmers. I wish I could give it Minus -5 stars. Very poor but you get what you pay for. I suggest anyone with the proper PC hardware buy a Belkin or NetGear video streaming adapter, and use the Free Intel WiDi software (pronounced \"wide eye\").", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Steve Donato \"sailor.in.florida\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like this little device, I think it could do a great deal more if Google would just allow, but for iPhone to television it's great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "J.K.R."}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Bought this based on low price and the google expectation. Comes with a short cable to make installation easier (good thing, since my tv sits against a wall), but it does need a separate power source (bad), although I'm guessing there's no power available in an HDMI port. Simple, idiot proof setup using menus. But when all is said & done..... what's the point? If I had Wifi but no internet access box (xbox, PS, apple TV, etc), yes, this thing would allow me to get music feeds & netflix on my antenna based tv.  I personally know of no one that fits that description. And am I going to use my phone to feed video to my tv? or use a 58in LED tv to view my photos? I suppose if I was ninety with macular degeneration I would appreciate this.  After an auspicious 1 week ho-hum use, I tried to give it away to my friends- no takers.
