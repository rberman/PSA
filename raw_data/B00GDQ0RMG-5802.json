[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love the convenience of the Fire TV Stick, works great, arrived early...would definitely recommend. The reason for a 4 and not a 5 is I am already bored with it.

Best Buy had it on sale for $24.95 and I figured if at the very least I could watch NetFlix it would be worth it. It is so much more than I expected. So many free apps with free content. Some apps basically add tv statikns for free. It is very fast too. It worth the cost. I would recommend even at full price. I didn't plan to sign up for Amazon Prime and figured I would just cancel once free trial is up, however I think I will miss all the added benifits.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brandi Jardine"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Worked great the first day.
