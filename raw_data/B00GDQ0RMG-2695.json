Previously, we used our gaming systems to access Netflix and amazon prime TV, but this is easier. Organized very well, couldn't have been easier to install (I should say \"plug in\"), so many apps - History channel, PBS - and you can watch their shows! I don't have cable tv, but through a lot of apps you can watch cable shows! Perfect picture. Easy remote. I recommend!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kathryn"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I wasn't able to download Netflix...
