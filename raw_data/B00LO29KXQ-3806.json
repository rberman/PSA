It is actually a great product being small and portable, but it so far does not add any convenience to our Vizio with its own apps. I'm sure I'll use the Fire Stick more when the Sling app works with it (especially when Sling gets AMC added to their lineup). But there were some concerns with setup that warrant noting and are the sole reason for not having 5-stars:- Amazon claims quick and easy setup. When first plugging in it connected to Wi-Fi quick enough, but immediately downloaded an update that took almost a half an hour to complete. Minus one star.- Before the update on first boot, I connected to my 5G internet. After the update, there are no longer 5G connections. Why would a software update DOWNGRADE the wireless connection? Minus one star.I haven't used the remote control app since the first day, but that is because it was dumb and made no sense to control. It's a shame, because the onscreen keyboard for the Fire Stick is also ridiculous. Functionally- the stick works well, but is no faster or clearer than the apps included on my television already.Oh, and on a final note, when is the Mirracast for Windows ever going to work as originally advertised? This feature alone would make the Fire Stick worth the price even without its core features. But it just doesn't work with Windows or any of my Android Samsung devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul M.
