You can use an APP or the remote which comes with this.  The APP is good, the remote is surprisingly better.  The product claims it is superior than ChromeCast because it has more memory and is not given to buffering.  However, this is not the case.  It actually buffers more than Chrome, and unlike Chrome is subject to the video pausing while the audio continues on.  This disappointment aside, the Fire Stick seems to be more versatile than Chrome.  For example it allows you to run apps.  Chrome by the way, does not run Amazon Prime.  I assume this is Amazon's choice.  The stick fits into an HDMI port, and must be powered from the wall unlike chrome which does not need an external power source.  Final verdict, I'd buy it again.  Works well 95% of the time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "iWitness"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The only reason it wasn't a five was I had trouble with mine.
