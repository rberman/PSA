[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Came up quickly as one of the HDMI inputs to our AV Receiver. Very thoughtful HDMI 'extender' allows the stick to reach above the receiver so that the remote can talk to it. Interface to content, and for setup, is wonderful, the best of all our inputs including Comcast, AppleTV. Content selection is awesome.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carlick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this stick, I have a smart TV in my living room but not in my sewing room, I love it cause I can keep watching something of substance, while I spend hours working on it will be getting another one soon", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this!

DON'T GET IT. RECEIVED MINE ON TIME; WAS VERY HAPPY UNTIL I OPENED AND BEGAN TO SET IT UP. I COULD NOT GET THE SOFTWARE TO DOWNLOAD FOR SEVERAL DAYS. CALLED AMAZON AND THEY WERE NICE TO PROCESS A NEW ONE IT'S ON THE WAY. SO, AFTER GETTING OFF THE PHONE AND CHECKING THE REVIEWS I WAS STUNNED TO SEE SO MANY HORROR STORIES. IF THE ONE ON ITS WAS DOES NOT WORK, I AM REQUESTING MY MONEY BACK AND STICKING WITH THE ROKU BRANDS AS THEY ARE GREAT PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I WISH THERE WAS A ZERO RATING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE FIRE TV STICK! RUN FROM IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Caesarleo"}]
