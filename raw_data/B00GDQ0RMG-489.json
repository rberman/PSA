That's my #1 wish. Add a browser so I can watch my school lectures on my tv.Second, update the mobile app. It's just not much use. Add more visual options so I can literally control it. I already have a basic remote. Give me more with the app.Third, the major unlikely part of my wishlist is screen mirroring from my other devices. Specifically from my phone, tablet, and laptop.Other than that, I love this thing! I use it literally daily.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. S.
