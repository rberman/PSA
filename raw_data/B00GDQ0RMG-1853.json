My son was watching all the same apps on his Xbox 360 which was wearing it out, and this will save his machine from dying that much quicker. Huge Amazon fan and this just made me like them even more!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MOM"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I do not have any pay tv services in my home. I use an OTA antenna along with Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime subscriptions. I have a non-smart TV in my living room and I was looking for a device that I could add to the TV to get Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime along with games. I have installed the Netflix, Hulu Plus and iHeartRadio apps and the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Despicable Me, and Asphalt 8 Airborne games. With just those 6 apps I now get a pop-up error message that my Fire TV stick is out of storage space and that I need to remove some apps. Fire TV stick is advertised as having 8Gb of storage however only 5.5Gb is usable. The error also states that I need to keep 500Mb free for system updates so really you only get 5Gb of usable space. There is also no support for any external storage device or cloud based storage for apps at all. The size of apps in the app store is also deceiving. GTA San Andreas was only listed as a 50Mb download but when you start the app it says it needs to download an additional 2.5Gb of data in order to work. It's kind of ridiculous to advertise the fact you have over 500 games available when you would be lucky to have enough space to install just two. I love the Fire TV features but I highly recommend getting Fire TV Box instead of the Stick so you can take advantage of external storage..Pros:Easy to use interface.No buffering when streaming video.I can cast my Nexus 4 and 7 (Android Lollipop 5.0) to my TV screen.Cons:Only 5Gb of usable space.No support for external storage.Voice search only searches Amazon Prime (not Netflix or Hulu)No way to filter between free and pay TV and Movies within Amazon Prime.I already owned a Fire TV box and I love it. I got this Fire TV stick free with a 3 month Sling TV subscription so the headaches I have with it do not bother me that much..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Enodrano"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I got a Fire TV stick and a Roku at the same time when I decided to cut cable.  The Fire TV stick was free with three months advanced purchase of Sling.  The Fire TV stick is okay for watching Amazon prime (I would hope...Amazon makes it) but it is not as good for watching anything else that I've found.  For instance, the interface with Sling is buggy, and is constantly crashing (though that is at least partly due to Sling).  Also, the app for the Fire TV stick is inferior to the Roku.  It is like a mouse pad for my finger to move the selector around my TV screen.  However, my TV screen is huge and my ipod/iphone is tiny, so that is a cumbersome way to browse the interface.  On the Roku app, there are features for typing stuff on my app while doing searches on my Roku.  I haven't found the equivalent functionality on the Fire TV app.  Finally, the remote feels like a cheap McDonald's happy meal toy.  It is extremely light plastic that feels and sounds hollow.  I'm constantly losing it in the clutter of my room.  Meanwhile, the buttons are tiny making it harder to make selections when I have to use it.I would not buy one of these.  However, for free, its okay.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paul Smith"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent product.....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jose Carlos sousa"}]
