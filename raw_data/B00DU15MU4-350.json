Sling TV is horrible. It pauses and \"catches up\" causing you to miss some of the programming you're watching (really sucks when you're watching sports). It is not a network bandwidth issue on my part because I can switch to netflix or hulu and have no problems at all. Avoid Sling TV ... Amazon Fire TV is ok, but expensive for what it is.
