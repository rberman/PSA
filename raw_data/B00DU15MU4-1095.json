I love it.  I did buy the cable to connect to the TV, I do think it should be made more clear that you need to also purchase the cable when you buy the Fire TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "L. Blake Borate \"Blake\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV is the best low power HTPC on the market right now. What's the big deal? It has the big streaming services: Netflix, Amazon Instant, and Hulu. The big deal is that you can sideload Android apps on this device, including Kodi (formerly known as XBMC). This enables you to play content you already have downloaded and stored on your network plus access to all of the plugins that Kodi has for streaming and other types of media.On top of all this you get great hardware which adds up to a very snappy UI and pleasant user experience. With the ability to sideload Kodi, the Fire TV beats the pants off of the WD TV Live.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Bryan Creel"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Quite simply, the biggest bang for the buck of any electronics I've ever purchased.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Herman P."}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I like the ideal of the Fire TV, but the cost and limited items for use are not worth the money.  You have to have the other add-ons to get all the TV, Movies and other shows. The free shipping is ok, but whats that got to do with the Fire TV?

The cable service there is expensive and unreliable and doesn't offer much anyway.  This was a gift for her at Christmas and she loves it.  With a prime account, she has access to lots of free movies and tv shows and music.  It is really great for her.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "wayne jackson"}]
