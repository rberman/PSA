But Roku is still the best media streamer on the market and Chromecast feels half-hearted in comparison.  It's not bad, by any means.  It streams Netflix, YouTube, etch... just fine. But the compatible app selection is disappointing and the integration with Windows is abysmal.  Roku and Amazon make streaming sticks that come with dedicated remotes.  If Google is going to be snooty about which devices work well with Chromecast, I can't recommend it until it is more universal or it gets a remote.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great tool.
