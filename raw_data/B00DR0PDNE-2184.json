Boy, was I wrong. Apple TV, for example, may offer similar features for all-Apple households, but we often have Android gadgets in the mix. And they don't play well with each other. Meanwhile, Chromecast works with Macs, PCs, Androids and iOS devices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jesus Navarrete"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Performs perfectly.

I've been switching between the Roku and Chromecast. Available apps typically stream really well via the Chromecast; sometimes they are glitchy and seem more like beta versions. The tablet and smartphone touchscreen interfaces are definitely much more convenient than the Roku's remote control-operated interface. I hope that developers will crank out more apps and the existing apps will become more stable as the product matures. Definitely lots of potential with this little stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "ML"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Setup was a 1 minute job (plus 2 more while it updated the software and rebooted once).

She asked me how I did that, and I said, \"Magic, baby!\" After a little while, I told her how it was really done, and she likes it so much that I'm going to get one for our other TV, as well.I often find stuff on YouTube that I want to show to our kids b/c it's cool and/or educational. Today, it was sand bubbler crabs. Much nicer on the big screen with home theater sound. The Chromecast does more than just YouTube, but even if that's all you use it for, it's a bargain at the price.The only slight fly in the ointment is that - at least on Linux - the Chrome plugin that allows casting to the Chromecast works rather poorly, with the framerate cut by 50% or more. That's a pretty minor use case for me, though, to the point that I didn't even take off a star for it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SpamFreeOrDie"}]
