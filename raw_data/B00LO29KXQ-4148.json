[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Overall, I really like my firestick. I cannot imagine buying a smart TV for the price they are going for, so this is a great alternative. I keep mine plugged in a HDMI port in my TV so it is always ready when I want to use it. I like that I can switch between Youtube, movies and TV shows quickly and easily. The remote is simple, easy to use and has a long range. I can play and pause from anywhere in my 1500 sq. ft single level house. The screensaver feature with the pretty images are a nice touch. There is a wide selection of apps which is nice, but the game selection leaves a little to be desired. My only issue so far is connectivity issues. It seems to only happen with TV shows and certain apps. Movies have always played well for me. I don't believe it's an issue with my Wifi, but it could be. I am a little confused by the power supply. I am not sure if it holds a charge or if I am supposed to keep it plugged in all the time. I will have to experimet more, as the power cord is fairly short so I can imagine circumstances where it would not reach an outlet while plugged into a TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rhianne"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use with so much that it offers!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Megan S."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Finally, finally, FINALLY - a simple, direct what to make use of my Amazon Prime subscription on my TV, without needing a separate PC hooked up to it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kindle Customer \"Reed Savory\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Easy to install, directions were clear, video is helpful once you get started. the battery case is hard to open i  was afraid that the remote was going to break. I wish that there were more current moves that would not have to pay for. We completed the 10 episodes of  Bosch, Michael Connolley is great, we love his series.

We have several gadgets in our home and I find myself using this one more than I thought I would.  Though it doens't play as many games the the Fire TV box, it has a nice assortment offered.  I did add the game controller.  This one might end up in the second bedroom as we might upgrade to the box.  Overall I'm happy with it, and we have two other streaming devices in the home, we use this one quite a bit, especially being Prime Members, and after the addition of the game remote.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "planettom \"planettom\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire Stick has works great, I like using this rather than the apps on a blue ray or PS3.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Shawn Darnell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Wonderful product for the price.
