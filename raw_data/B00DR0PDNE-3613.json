It creates the impression that you can broadcast from your comp to the TV almost anything, but in reality it is ONLY with CHROME browser and only Youtube and Netflix. So, basically, they created yet another device to keep you in their commercial and tracking domain. I installed it easy, no problem, then install Google Chrome browser ( reluctantly) and then , after seemingly everything is set, it says, \" One more step\"  - You have to instal an Extension ???? What ??? And the window warns you that they can access ( and they will) ALL your data and web browsing experience , bla-bla-bla. Now it is clear..this is just another tracking device to collect user's behavior in the net and so on.. Bad, bad , bad, Google !!! What happened to  \"Do not create evil !\"  Slogan, Google ???Let me tell you this, Google: I am uninstalling Chrome, and this little device will not be used, unless you make it to work with all the browsers. Thank you!Otherwise, the quality of the video transmitted to the  TV is good, no problem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "13/52", "author": "krassimir kaltchev"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "i think this is amazing and it's just what i was looking for.  like other reviewers have said netflix, youtube & play video's work best and the quality from the browser isn't great (still not terrible).

Tried six different HDMI inputs, all of which worked fine with TiVo, PS3 & AppleTV. Tried two power sources, both USB on the TV sets as suggested, or via the AC adapter to the wall. Reset the device with a 30-sec button push two different times, and even hard reset my TVs.I'm very proficient at both home theater setup and PCs, so I tried everything -- but never saw a setup screen, even though the device's lights were active and flashing.

Cobb \"smarter than the average bear\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Chromecast is now the biggest (and cheapest) release from Google this year. The Chromecast is an absolute steal for the price of $35, and even sweeter if you happened to be one of the people who got it when the Netflix codes were still available for 3-free months. That roughly brings your total out lay down to about $11 before taxes. Which is not bad at all considering all the things that it can do and the fact that it is truly multi-platform with any device that can use chrome.When I first heard about the Chromecast, I had zero interest, but the more I heard it talked about prior to release, the more interested I became. I already had a desktop computer that was connected to my TV which allowed me to use Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, etc on my main TV, instead of a cable tv connection. In addition there was also a PS3 and Xbox360 connected to this TV as well. But eventually when my girlfriend moved in, my toys needed to go upstairs into the spare bedroom. This left me without an option to watch netflix, Hulu, Youtube in the livingroom.If I had a \"Smart\" tv, then I could just connect to the internet and continue watching the same content as before, my plasma is a bit before the time of \"smart\" tvs, so the Chromecast is a wonderful device as a replacement. It is very low power compared to the original desktop PC that was originally powering my internet content. It does get a little warm however.Setup is very easy, taking only 5 minutes or less. It consisted of downloading the chromecast app, plugging in the chromecast and powering it up, connecting to the chromecast and granting it permission to join my existing wireless network.I currently have the chromecast plugged into the back of my home theater receiver on its own input channel. I have found myself multiple times while browsing my flipboard app coming across a video, flipping on the tv and connecting to the chromecast. It's just so much better to watch it on a bigger screen. I'm really hoping the developers take this device and run with it, giving users a way to cast stored media on their phones, tablets, laptops, etc to their tv.I think something like this would be a great present for my parents who may be interested in some of the content on netflix, but aren't really sure how to access it in an easy way without hooking the laptop directly to the tv.I purchased mine in store at best buy, apparently the day before they were supposed to be available for sale, had i known the demand would be like this, I'd have bought 2!!!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Zachary S.

The setup was easy, and I don't have any complaints with how it works. It's a novelty item for our household and will probably end up being taken to the office to project from any of multiple laptops to a TV.
