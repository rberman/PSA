The Broadcom SoC isn't awesome and very dated performance wise.  Scored 2244 in 3DMark. The SoC runs at 1GHz instead of the spec sheets 1.2GHz.If you want to do more than just stream media (play games), get the FireTV.  The games I have tried that work with just the remote are a bit laggy.  The UI can also be unresponsive at times if you try and do a lot.This can be fixed with an updated SoC so hopefully Amazon addresses this.Runs Android 4.2.2 with 512MB of RAM doesn't help either, usually only like 70MB free.My only complaint about the UI, it should be easier to find and categorically sort through Prime only content.I got mine free with the SlingTV promo.  Wish I spent the $50 to get the FireTV.  The stick is super awesome and making me cancel my Pandora and Netflix as reaching Prime content is a lot easier and better now.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "red_dog007"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I think you need more local apps for fire tv like you have have for kindle, The performance of the stick is great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "James S."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So far so good!
