[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works very easily with a newer tv system.  You will want to add items to your 'watchlist' FIRST from your computer (prior to going onto the FireStick) to be sure that you have items that are FREE for Amazon Prime members.  It is sometimes confusing as to what is FREE when searching through the Fire Stick, and so I highly suggest that you first search via computer, add it to your 'watchlist,' and THEN go to your TV and Fire Stick to see your options.  :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Worthless. I can get the same apps plus MORE on my Xbox 360, Wii, Sony Smart Blu-Ray, and my Smart TV.  In fact all my other products on their own offer me more apps. The games are B-rated and are lacking. If I had the time with the holidays I would absolutely send it back!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "J. J."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "All in all a great HD product.  I'm using mine on a wall mounted 42 in. In my living room.  Its small enough that the stick and accompanying wires are easily hidden.  Takes a little syncing to get all amazon content initally but after that its a breeze to use.Now for the cons:The remote that comes with it is extremely basic.  Does enought just to surf content.Amazon features games which say you can use the basic remote for, but it's more frustrating than whats its worth especially for children who are used to an xbox or ps controller.  A controller like that of course is extra.  Amazon needs to allow you to customize your home so you can omit things like pictures and music, etc which you may not want broadcast on the tv.  And finally the parental controlls are archaic,  its either all or nothing.  I wouldnt mind my boys \"purchasing\" a prime movie or other prime content which is free, but i have to enter my pin every single time which gets annoying if I'm doing something else.  They need to update that so you can allow prime purchases without a pin while safeguarding against accidental or purposeful rentals or in app purchaces that cost money.Overall a great product for a HDTV that doesn't have built in app / wifi connection.  Needs some updating for my liking before its a 5 star.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mcoulter"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love the fire stick.

The Fire TV Stick does it perfectly.  In addition, there are a host of free and inexpensive apps that bring news, entertainment and games to my TV - all with a device I plug into an open HDMI slot.The Fire TV Stick comes with an approximately 4-5\" HDMI extension so it can fit into the tightest HDMI slots and still allow you to plug the Stick into an external power source (power cord comes with the Fire TV Stick and is recommended for best performance).I also love that I can pull the Fire TV Stick out of my TV, put it into my pocket and take it travelling with me.  I don't even need to take the remote control because there is a great (free) remote control application for my Android phone that allow me to control the Fire TV Stick from my phone (using WiFi).Occasionally I need to reset the device when it freezes (very seldom).  Simply hold the center control button and \"play\" button simultaneously for about 6-10 seconds.  Then the device works perfectly again.  (Just like every other electronic device, it needs to be \"rebooted\" occasionally).The best device for my TV I've ever had.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert A.
