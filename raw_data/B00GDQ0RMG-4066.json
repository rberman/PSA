I'll be selling this off and going back to my chromecast. The remote was a nice feature but no voice button which I thought it would being a fire tv product line.

The interface is nice as well as the remote. I considered just getting a Smart TV instead, but it ended up being a far better value to just purchase the stick. No need to pay a premium for a Smart TV, and I can unplug the stick and take it with me when travelling! It would be nice if the stick could power itself through the HDMI port, but with some TV's you can power it via a spare USB port on the TV. Otherwise, you need to have an extra outlet available as it is with most other streaming type sticks.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "J"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Nice product.
