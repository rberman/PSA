We can easily send youtube, hulu plus, netflix etc straight to it.

I have not used any other video streaming products.I have played video from you tube, crackle and the quality is good. There is no lag or video getting stuck even when I open up other applications and work. Used with iPhone, iPad and computer. For other apps that are not supported, e.g. movie played in browser have to leave the browser in full screen mode for streaming. I normally do not broadcast my wireless network SSID but  chromecast name itself would show up as a public open SSID when looking for network connections. Probably a firmware update fixed it, now it does not show up when I actually found time to look into its settings.I bought this for $35 and within couple of days it was available for $30 (and less) at other prominent e-commerce retailers. I called up amazon to price match but the customer service rep declined saying I could ship it back myself but they wont price match. Expected better service from Amazon from the reviews I read at other places. I should have looked around a little bit.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "SS"}]
