It's a nice way to get Prime TV etc. on a big screen without having to connect computer. So far, so good. I don't like that the stick has to be plugged in to wall socket, it just makes for more confusion in the cord jungle that is behind TV, but that's no big deal really.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MRM"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Pretty good.

The final choice for the Fire TV stick came down to our heavy use of Prime and Netflix.  Product shipped fast and my Amazon Prime Acct info was already loaded so we were up and running in minutes.  We had standard hotel broadband and had no issues watching Netflix movies/shows on our trip.  One tip if you plan to use this in hotels - take a 8-10 foot extension cord with you!  Many of the hotel entertainment stands are heavy or secured in place making it very difficult to reach the outlets behind the tv so having a cord you can run to an easily accessible wall outlet will save you a lot of frustration and maybe even your back!  Extremely please with this purchase!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SCarolinian"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great & gives me channels that I could otherwise not get overseas!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dave In Arizona"}]
