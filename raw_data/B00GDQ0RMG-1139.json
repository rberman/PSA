[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Learning curve but love the basis! I am an Amazon Prime fan and it is now my go to place! This just made it much better! Now the kids can have movie night on their TV! All the movies we buy at their finger tips for them to enjoy together. Especially at spend the night parties! One big down side, the popping noise. Would have 5 stars if it weren't for this painful popping. I can't figure out how to stop this popping noise the sick makes through the speakers when making selections. Also another set back we got around.... make sure it is close enough to the WiFi or in an unobstructed area. If not, you will constantly have connection issues. Our port was in back not on the side and was a problem. We solved this issue by using the attachment extender. It then hung below our TV instead of behind and now it gets WiFi signal no problem. Still would highly recommend it though!", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Cooper"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This item is useless in most cases I have tried to use it.

My wired Ethernet is much faster.Here are the observations I have about this product.1. It's cheap, so cheap I can justify purchasing this to experiment with if it doesn't work.2. The antenna for wifi can't pick up much of any signal from router 20 feet away until I purchased a new Asus N66U router, and even then I still had sporadic SD streaming instead of 1080p HD. I eventually ended up upgrading to bigger antennas and spent hours tweaking the wireless channels to remove interference and router placement and antenna degree angles. This was way too much effort just to get HD streaming to work so from that perspective this product is defective.3. No USB support for external storage.4. You can stream videos from local network wifi shared devices with windows home share via other apps on amazon such as Vimu.5. Kodi side loading possible6. Two cables will always connect to the stick, don't let those other product images fool you. You need the hdmi extender so the stick antenna doesn't get blocked by the tv, and you need the power cord on the side to connect to ac power. This is no longer a \"stick\" product so much as mini version of the fire tv with the same amount of cords minus the voice control, ethernet and usb support.7.Did I mention no wired Ethernet support? So you're stuck with poor antenna reception and SD content if you got a lousy router or old wire mesh reinforced walls like me.8. Stick does get hot under operation. It becomes too hot to hold.9. Large amount of movies and TV shows including HD movies are available for prime members to stream on this device at no extra cost.10. No live TV from amazon unless you use third party apps at your own expense.11. The simple remote and user interface are amazing, the remote is very clean and easy to use.So unless you like to play with something mostly experimental and highly finicky, I'd save your money and just wait.Amazon app is already available on more robust platforms like the full fire tv box and playstation consoles.In summary, this is a good idea for a product with a large amount of promise and huge application add on base, but I would wait for the next hardware version to come out or buy the full fire tv.  Maybe an announcement of new version of fire tv stick for next holiday?*crosses fingers for better antenna*", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "so glad I finally purchased this.. easy to use, intuitive icons and the prime selection is fantastic!

I purchased the first one and enjoyed using the Plex app to connect to my video server at home when I travel to my parents house.  I decided to purchase a second one because I like the Prime Instant Video app on my toddler's iPad for her to watch her favorite shows (Dora and Bubble Guppies).  I assumed since I've been able to set viewing restrictions (G and 7 ratings) on her iPad that I would be able to do the same on her Fire TV Stick for her bedroom (she doesn't have a cable connection to prevent her watching inappropriate shows).....WRONG assumption!!! I spent an hour looking through menus on the Fire TV Stick and the help section on the Amazon site only to not get a clear understanding.  Eventually I initiated a chat session with the help desk because I couldn't believe this couldn't be done.  After going round and round repeating myself via chat and telling the representative that I have a PIN set but I don't want to have to enter it in EVERY single time she watches a show, I was informed that \"Parental controls work by requiring entry of your Amazon Instant Video PIN to authorize purchases and bypass any viewing restrictions you've set for your registered devices.\"I'm an IT person and I'm typically very pleased with Amazon and their products.  However I think they dropped the ball with this part of the device.  I also told the chat rep that it's stupid that I can set viewing restrictions for non-Amazon devices and not Amazon devices.  I'm not sure if I'll keep the device in her room yet.  I bought the first one on a pre-order for $19.99 and reluctantly paid full-price for the second one just so my daughter could watch her TV instead of her iPad during her TV time.  I'm just thoroughly frustrated and disappointed with the Fire TV Stick since it didn't fulfill it's intended purpose.  I would probably give it 4 stars otherwise.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "siaraelise"}]
