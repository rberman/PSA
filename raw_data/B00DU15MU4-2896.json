If you don't belong to Amazon Prime this is almost definitely not worth it. Roku is much easier to navigate, as is my smart TV. (I bought FireTV to give brains to a dumb TV.)2) REALLY buggy. This is just my own anecdote, but this device lost its mind when I first started it up (although admittedly it corrected itself with little interference from me). But for the past few days, it freezes when I try to run Netflix. And that has not self-corrected. In fact, I see no way to correct it other than restoring the default settings. UPDATE: unplugging fixed the Netflix app but the device has now crashed twice (light on but no output to TV).3) There are some addictive free games on here. You may not see this as a problem but Hill Climb Racing has stolen literally a couple days of my life. I would rather have them back, quite frankly. Not a fan of Angry Birds for the same reason. To each his own, so take this criticism as it relates to you.4) As addictive as it is, the game does not even fit on the screen. Critical things like your score and progress are cut off about 2/3 of the way down. Is that a 3 or a 5, no its a 6, no 8. You just can't tell unless you watch it change instead of playing the game. UPDATE: It turns out this was easily fixed by adjusting the screen settings. So the complaint is really that it was not done automatically, but it's fine now.5) The remote is better than most, but the two rows of buttons are exactly the same size and shape, so you will occasionally hit the wrong button if you try to use it entirely by feel, as you would when playing a game. Also, as is true for other such devices and remotes, there is no way to program this remote to control volume or TV power. So, really it's just yet another remote for your coffee table.6) If you watch a 4:3 show on a 16:9 screen, you get the worst of both worlds! At least in Netflix app, the picture is stretched to fit the wider screen but then the sides are lopped off to create a 4:3 picture. This corrects itself if you pause and unpause. Just another example of them not getting it quite right.About a week or so after buying this at a great price ($53 and not worth it) from Staples I got an email from Amazon asking me to answer a questionnaire about it. One question made me realize I bought this because I like Amazon so much.

I hope it will come eventually.  I'd love to drop our Dish altogether.  We already refuse to do business with Comcast.

I can honestly say that for the price this is the best device I have used for streaming.  The user interface is nice, elegant, and intuitive.  I love that it plays the next episode automatically while watching Netflix (great for binge watching new shows).  I would agree with most people that it would be nice to have a filter to only see free Amazon Prime content.  Overall the device is very responsive and the remote works great and doesn't need line of sight.  My son likes to play some of the games that I downloaded on the device, we have yet to buy the game remote as the remote included is fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Chad Wilken"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I can not believe you guys do NOT have the WWE network on this fire tv..
