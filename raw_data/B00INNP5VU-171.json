[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I'm getting ready to send it back for a refund. I can't get the remote to work unless I take the batteries out and reinstall. That's ridiculous! Roku has been lax in responding. Too bad their customer service and technical issues has to present a bad experience to first-time users.Been trying to contact customer service with no luck or response. BEWARE!! It could be a good product but if the remote doesn't work and you can't get customer support you are out-of-luck.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AnnieOaklee"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I know that Roku is a great product because I have maybe 8 units.

I was worried by two reports on this product. 1) it takes ages to boot up and only boots up with the TV on. -This is true it is only powered on when the TV is on (If you are using TV USB) but the boot time is not bad. 2) It is slow and laggy. - I have the Roku 3 and using PLEX (RARFLIX) it is just as responsive and works sweet.
