[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "This little stick is awesome for the amount of content you can store, application options, etc.  I would say it goes toe to toe with my Roku 3.  However, I gave this 3 stars because the wifi range seems to be very short (and if you can't connect from 20 feet away, you can't use this).  I bought this for a TV that sits about 20 feet away with just one wall between the firestick and the router.  If I bring it closer, say by about 5 feet and plug it into my other TV, it works just great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AnimalMotherFukah"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It Freezes sometimes.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KEV"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great, easy to use.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Harold Spankus"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Feature wise and potential value this is a 5 star device. The video quality makes it a 1 star. The video is pixilated.My test and verification of this was done using the same TV, within 15 min of each other using the flixster app and same video. I tested using my Chromecast, my computer connected to the TV via hdmi and the Fire Stick. The Chromecast and computer had equally good picture comparable to 1080P. The Fire Stick had a poor picture quality which I would compare to a old YouTube video. I switched back and forth  between devices to make sure it wasn't a buffering/bandwidth issue but no matter the switching done, the video did not improve on the Fire Stick. Note that I did confirm in the settings that the fire stick was set to 1080P.In all, the stick is great for the children's room but I'm keeping it away from my main TV. I would not buy it at $40 and would just suggest another Chromecast. More power is great, but what good does it do if you \"just spin the tires\"?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MR B"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really cool product.

Unfortunately encountered problems at every turn. From the start the actual plug was machined poorly and was difficult to plug into the TV. After bending the Amazon Fire stick HDMI port I was able to finally connect the Fire to the TV. The USB power from the TV that more than adequately provide power to my chromcast was not sufficient for the Amazon Fire and a external plug. Really poor design on the USB plug, it takes up a minimum of two ports on my power strip from it's bulky size. But the big problem comes in when I want to watch a movie. The device hangs up constantly! What's the point this device if it can't stream movies of TV? Also the app for this device is still not yet available for iOS..My $20 would have been better spent on a game of poop dollar", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Daaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnn \"dan dan dan dan1\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Loved the box, love the stick, but I hadn't previously thought about the power supply.

It is probably the most powerful streaming stick out there.  But, it is not there yet.The interface is clunky.  Searching for content is not intuitive.The channel lineup is a little bit sparse.It requires a wall plug.  You can't use it plugged directly into USB of your TV.  This will make it bad (or more work) for anyone that hides all of their wires.Also, I could not get the Screen Mirroring feature to work with any Miracast device that I tried.  This should not be an advertised feature because it probably doesn't work beyond Amazon's own devices.

The HDMI extender cable proved difficult to connect to the TV with intermittent flashes of the Amazon & Fire Stick screens. Finally after much jiggling, I was able to make a solid connection (I never had this problem making an HDMI cable connection from the cable box or laptop to the TV). The first TV show I streamed had perfect HD video, but clipped audio. This was corrected by changing the audio setting. OK - we enjoyed episodes of \"Parade's End\" through Amazon Prime at no cost - no buffering, good audio & video. The next day, having changed no settings on the stick or TV, the video displayed a lot of \"snow\". Although I like the convenience of not having to connect my laptop to the TV stream media each time, I'm not sold 100% using the stick and am reluctant giving it a higher rating until this issue is resolved.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mario"}]
