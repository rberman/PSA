We bring it travelling so we can access Netflix on the road (and, when you're travelling with kids, that's a necessity).  You can only stream it when you are using the Google Chrome browser, so that's a tiny bit inconvenient in the Apple universe, but only a hiccup, really.  We also take it to Grandma's for the same reason.  We actually kept an old Samsung phone with a cracked screen that's sole job is to run Netflix on the Chromecast :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lorien Wallace"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "reasonable product for $ 30", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mark s perez"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It is convenient, but what I have seen is my laptop gets very hot quickly when I stream from my macbook pro (with google chrome) and my battery dies quickly.Ofcourse this doesn't work in iPad even with google chrome browser.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "praveen kotagiri"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It did not work very well, then completely stopped working.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Shelby Spainhower"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "would not work.
