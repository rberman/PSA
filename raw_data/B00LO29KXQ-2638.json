It's very reliable and gets the job done for your viewing pleasure. Amazon was also very helpful in getting me thru the initial stage of familiarization. I did point out to them that the unit needs to be packed with more clearer instructions.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Syl Rachel Quinn \"IBelieveInMiracles\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I really love this thing. It is very easy to use and has most of the apps I use for media consumption.I also own a Chromecast, but this I bring around primarily because of the dedicated remote.However, with that said, I feel the roku stick is a better value as it has support for far more apps. I feel that if you aren't a prime member, then this isn't worth a look in its price range. I say that because the interface is primarily designed around you leveraging amazon instant video and music.If you do not have a prime membership, that will definitely ruin the experience.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jon Jon"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard Carson \"rick\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Not having a Smart TV, this was a necessity.to download from the Internet... videos from Amazom", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jean M.

My hub watches ESPN 2 for fishing and I like AMC for walking dead so this suited our needs :)  I may check out better call saul too.  Sling also has abc family and we like modern family so that is cool as wel!!!!!  It has adult swim and cartoon network which shows some popular cartoons and such for the teenagers.I digress.  Anyway we hooked it up without issue to our Sony Bravia television and the picture was stunning!  I was also able to connect through the kindle fire stick app on my 2012 kindle hd tablet and download the app to my android cell phone and connect and use the \"fling\" feature through there.  This made the fire stick even EASIER to use because it come with a keyboard function.You can download several apps and games as well and probably even shop on there too I am geussing if you wanted :)great purchase.  For 20 bucks a month sling gave us a great alternative to cable.  I pay $80 a month for the highest/fastest internet I can get as I have a family of computer/gamers.  So for around 100 a month I know have a little television and internet.  I find this is still less than many popular \"bundled\" packages.As a prime member I also have access to lots of free content on amazon and the option to rent current content on family nights, which is almost like the \"on demand\" option through cable, I feel as though I am missing nothing????What a hit!
