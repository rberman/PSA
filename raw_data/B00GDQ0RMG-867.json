I also liked the fact that it has the capacity to hold a few GB of data that you may want to load on it in the future. I am currently considering buy another one for the bedroom, that way I don't have to unhook the one I have in the Family Room.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "B. Bellamy \"New Mac User\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "works great with kodi, allows me to watch all movies I want online, for free using various apps.  Watched the Rhonda Roussey fight for free, all 34 seconds of it, so it paid for itself right there.  It did stutter during that 4 hours plus of watching UFC 190 that night.  Hasn't happened again so I dont know if it was the streak or what. If you use the amazon system, this thing is a must have.  If you have good wireless router in your home, this thing is a SHOULD have.  With proper apps, you can cut the cable cord for good.  This firestick is so cheap and so amazing that everyone should try it.  Make sure you load kodi or some other streaming media player system, since that is the true greatness of this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "fanny hamsteak \"Fanny Hamsteak\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the ease of setup and use.
