[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I bought the chromecast believing I could screencast fromnmy android tablet to my TV, but turns out it only works with certain android devices, not the lenovo tablets that my wife and I both have. Pretty much everything else it does I can do with my blue ray player. I accept responsibility for not researching the product thoroughly enough before buying it. I would advise prospective buyer to check to see if you particular device is supported before buying.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "R.

It is cheap and does a lot more for it's price.As long as you have a streaming server (such as YouTube, Netflix, HBO Go) you're good. If you want to mirror a device or a browser tab, it won't work as smooth as a wired display - mirroring a playing video is not practical. It's not all that bad - there are solutions for streaming local files (photos and videos) to the Chromecast. My favorite solution for this is Videostream extension for Chrome. Maybe it's not as convenient as a media server, but let's all remember that this is just a streamer stick (and a wonderful one!).P.SI am disappointed that Amazon doesn't ship more than 1 device outside the US. Purchasing more than one or even purchasing one at a time is not possible for some reason...", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mickey Shnaiderman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I can't say enough good things about Google Chromecast. The applications that make use of it continue to grow. Showtime Anytime  updated it's apps to include support.  If you aren't content using a tablet or your phone as control device for it then go for a box device like the Fire TV or Roku.
