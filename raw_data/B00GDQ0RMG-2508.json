[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "The Fire TV Stick is just a great product -- well designed, engineered and produced.  We are very pleased with it overall.  Installation was a breeze, quick and trouble free.  However, there needs to be more work done on the user interface to make it more friendly so that the choices available, no matter where you are in the various sequences, are labeled and visible.  Initially some trial and error button pushing is necessary to get from where you are to where you want to go, but once discovered, it's pretty straightforward.  Also the distinction between free programs/movies and those for which an additional charge will be assessed needs to be more explicit.  Other than those minor inconveniences, it gets a \"thumbs up\" rating.  Moreover, the fit and finish and overall quality of the unit itself and the accompanying accessories is simply extraordinary, and coupled with Amazon's unrivaled delivery/fulfillment efforts make this an outstanding value laden choice.  Thanks, Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Low Wings"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Pros: Mine works perfectly, strong network connection, smooth streaming at 1080p, very customizable.
