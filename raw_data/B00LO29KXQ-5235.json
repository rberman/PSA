[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "I really wanted to like this. I already had a Chromecast and was looking forward to the Amazon Fire TV stick. The Fire stick is definitely faster than the Chromcast and I absolutely love the utility of the remote, but the pluses end there. The Fire stick repeatedly freezes to the point where you have to unplug the power cord and plug it back in again in order to fix it. Also, it won't hold a constant internet connection. So, when you are watching something on say Netflix or Plex, every 10 mins or so, it has to stop to buffer.  Overall, I was very disappointed with the Fire TV stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "DMC"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I am starting to learn how to play with this new toySo far so good!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Fuad Ziai"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love love love the fire stick!

I didn't have high expectations to be honest, as I thought \"Well, another HDMI dongle on the market\" -- but for $19 I figured why not, let's give it a shot.  And I just have to say, wow was I wrong with those low expectations!Let me explain...I cut the cable/satellite subscription long ago, and my setup has been this for the past few years - A Chromecast, a Roku 2 XS (Primarily for Netflix/Pandora), and a dedicated Zotac ZBOX-AD04 running XBMC/Kodi (OpenELEC) to play local media.I've been using XBMC for over 10yrs, since it was originally released for the first Xbox, and I've grown to absolutely love it.  I've tried all the variants - Plex, Boxee (yeah, good old Boxee... is that on the Samsung TV's yet after the acquisition?), etc.. But in my opinion, nothing holds up to the XBMC experience.  I don't love the Netflix implementation on XBMC, but that's about the only thing that I don't love about the platform.I hadn't done much research on the Fire TV devices, so much to my delight when I discovered that these things are Android under the hood, and that you can sideload basically any Apk file onto them without much fuss.So a little bit of Googling, and a couple YouTube videos later and voila, I had a fully functional XBMC installation directly on my fire stick.  The beauty here too is, absolutely no tinkering needed with hardware -- no network issues, no audio issues, no remote issues, etc.. I'm assuming that since XBMC is simply an App on top of an already-configured OS with working hardware, this is why it all \"just works\".The only thing I did have to do was push 3 files over to the device -- advancedsettings.xml, passwords.xml, and sources.xml  I pulled these directly off my Zotac box, with zero modifications done.  Now my Fire TV XBMC fully sees my network shares, connects to my MySQL database, and saves the user credentials to authenticate to the network.I can honestly say, this $20 device can truly be considered a direct replacement for ALL THREE of my previous devices (Chromecast, ZBOX, Roku).  For my viewing habits, the XBMC user experience is exactly the same on this device as it had been on the $250 dedicated ZBOX with 8gb of memory.  Your experience may vary here if you love streaming gigantic HD files to your device, but I have yet to see a network buffering issue or a hiccup on this thing.I'm going to give it a little bit longer just to make sure, but I'm pretty sure I'll have a Chromecast, Roku & Zbox selling on eBay shortly :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "kgibbons04"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Not all that hard to install for a non-techie, 74 year old.
