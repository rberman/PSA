The UI is cluttered and cumbersome. not sure if its because they are trying to constantly \"sell\" you something. The app store installs are annoying. THE ONE APP Plex I actually want to use DOES NOT work with this and never truly has. So that is 5$ down the pooper. Amazon blames plex and plex blames amazonIf I could get a refund (which I cant cause it was free) or trade this for a roku stick I would. Its complete garbage!DO NOT BUY!old review:So here we go and Im trying not to be biased since I did get it free with my SLING subscription.First Im a tried and true ROKU guy. I am an android guy for most stuff but when it comes to streaming television and media ROKU just takes the cake. At the time I didnt know SLING was also giving away a free roku stick or I would have gotten that instead.Anyway here are the prosIts pretty fast and easy to set up.Streams wellThe android remote app is nice (except the navigation sliding is awful just put arrows on it) and gives you the voice funtions lacking in the regular remote..........?Cons are as followed.Very cluttered looking/feeling UI.No dedicated app store you can see. You can use the search function but its iffy and other wise you have to install apps via the amazon app store on another device then sync.I mean in the end it really does nothing that no other device, ROKU included, can do. Plus my ROKU pretty much does it all better.Its also very picky with file formats.Trying to stream from my tablet to the stick via allcast was very picky. It seems the stick ONLY likes Mp4 files where my roku can play almost ANYTHING.Also I purchased PLEX from the android app store yet when trying to run it on the fire stick the same purchase does not work. This is insane since they ARE BOTH ANDROID! Why the purchase needs to be redone through amazon is just garbage to be honest and a rip off.Again being an android guy once you look into hackign and installing full on android apps through your phone/tablet its pretty nice, if they work, but otherwise this just isnt enough to make me switch from rokus.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tyler Nicholas Turel"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Can't enjoy movies because it is constantly trying to spool up the movie.
