I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for an alternative to cable. I love netflix and sling tv and for 1/3 the cost of cable I have great channels that I actually want to watch and no contract. If you want to complete your television experience get an antenna up to 50 miles and get upto 35 or more local channels. I have way more now than ever before.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "celia pereira"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Thank you Amazon :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ron Stallcup"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Far exceeded our expectations!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mojo9246"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome, great for watching loads of stuff with paying high prices for cable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "theresa"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I bought this during the two day introductory sale for $19.
