In 30 minutes I know I will have 2 to 3 interruptions.I received the early buy in to the firestick so only cost me 15 dollars. Today though I had to go out and buy a Roku 3.  I've own a Roku in another room and it's rare to have any connection issues.  I've know installed the Roku 3 in the basement and as expected  no connection issues.  Just watched the new Dracula movie.So bottom line, I think the firestick can be a great product if the connection issue is resolved.Thanks for reading.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Rocky McStone"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love it I was very happy with how easy it was to set up", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lynda Mull"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have the Fire TV Stick and 2 Roku's. The Fire Stick is much faster than my Roku's. My shows start almost instantly with the Fire Stick. I gave it 5 stars because HBO Go is coming soon and I will have everything I want.

Easiest (and very inexpensive way) to access all my Prime video and music content on the HD tv.  I still have cable for all the sports content so i did not get the full Amazon TV.  This Fire stick is just right for my needs.  Have not even explored any of the apps yet as I have been too busy enjoying the \"free\" Prime movie and music content.  Small and easy to install.  Finds your home wifi network simple as can be.  I have had this for a month and use it almost every day.  Worth every penny in my book.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "hammerhead \"kauff\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Honestly, I was expecting more from it. I got 2 of them for my house and I'm not a big fan of it. I own the Roku box and the Chromecast, and so far the Roku box is the best. I bought this product when I just came out, so I only paid $20 for it. I have used it for the past 2 months and it just not good. Hulu works every now and then. You could be watching a show and suddenly you get a message from hulu saying that there has been an error. This only happens with the Fire TV stick. Netflix has the same issues. Sometimes the Fire stick loses internet connection for no reason. You have to unplug it and plug it back in. So, I do not recommend this product. Get something else for now. Roku is a reliable product.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "EG"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it! Love it! Makes accessing programs and apps on my TV effortless.
