I love that I do not have a lot hardware or wires around my TV as the Fire Stick just plugs into your TV.My Fire Stick arrived early and in little package (less waste).The only reason I give it three stars is because my show or movie will occasionally freezes but sound keeps going than the image will \"catch up\" to the audio and the characters will move in a fast forward speed. I have the highest internet service offered so I don't know why it lags.My sister experienced the same problem. She couldn't take the freeze/lag anymore and passed her fire stick down to another sibling, who does not mind it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Frances"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "So far I love it.
