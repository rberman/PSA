Gave one to my brother but he already had the Fire TV so he sold it on craigslist. Two days later, i tried the amazon fire stick and and its already Registered the device under my account. I can watch movies for prime member didnt try to buy or rent any movies. But I'm  sure that  It will let u buy the movies without asking for password.  If you plan on buying this Fire Stick for gifts, you better go under your amazon account and Deregister the device .I don't write review ever because of my bad grammar.

No brainerSetup\u2022 4/5 on ease: connect to HDMI, power and connect to Wi-Fi\u2022 3/5 on time: brand new device required a software update and reboot. At my 50Mbps connection, the total time was 12 minutes. The update required a reconnection to Wi-Fi, wiping out the previously setup connection This might not seem like a big deal but with all the Wi-Fi squatters around, I have a long and complicated password. If I have to do this each update, I can tell you it won\u2019t happen.\u2022 Overall it was ok. Fix the password reset and we\u2019re good.PLAYBACKHULU Plus\u2022 Audio and video lag after each advertisement. Sometimes lasting for 10-15 seconds. Mostly smooth through the rest of the segment with a few blips here and there. In contrast, I don\u2019t recall ever seeing an audio sync or video blip with Chromecast or my Sony Blu-ray playerNETFLIX\u2022 No audio glitches\u2022 Multiple video pixilation, blue/blur and pause\u2022 Remote jumps around on the menu. Sometimes it moves one space per click and other times it moves multiple.ADD ONShowtime Anywhere: DirecTV not supported on this deviceHBO Go: NoINTERFACE\u2022 Clunky and non-intuitive. There are too many \u201csmart\u201d menus that shift and I can\u2019t find Netflix or Hulu+ easily. As expected, Prime has a dedicated side menu and easy to reach your queue.\u2022 I want to customize the interface. Move options, apps, etc. around. Apple TV is perfect when it comes to an interface. Simple, easy and in your face. Do that. Don\u2019t\u2019 get complicated.EXTENDING LAPTOP\u2022 Miracast has limited and not standard access to transmit your screen to the monitor. I was unable to fund a decent Mac options. This is where Chromecast is the clear winner. \u201cCast\u201d or throw any tab from Google Chrome to the monitor and use Videostream to \u201cCast\u201d movies, music and more. It\u2019s easy and like a Mac, it just works.FINALGreat to provide Amazon Prime movies. Since I own it, I will keep it.I\u2019ll stick with my Chrome Cast where I can still Cast Prime so I\u2019m not outHere\u2019s the kicker. You have a guest staying and they want to listen to their Pandora, watch their Netflix when they crash out. The only option is Chromecast as it\u2019s powered from the users device, not the \u201chome\u201d account. I have this same beef with SONOS, which I love.Don\u2019t tie to individuals.

I'm serious. Like, the Wii is right next to my Fire Stick and streams Netflix without a hiccup and this thing hangs at 25% buffering half the time. Pretty sad. I just want HD streaming. I constantly see 'Connected with Problems' under my network settings even though the device regards the signal strength as 'Very Good'.UPDATE 3/14/15: I took another reviewer's advice and have placed the Fire TV Stick in a static free bag and performance is greatly improved.
