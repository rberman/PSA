[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "I really wanted this to be the full replacement for my AppleTV and for my Visio Smart TV, for that matter.  But it does such a poor job of streaming video that it is impossible.  We use Netflix quite often, but when running it through the Fire TV Stick, it is perpetually jumping or pausing - to such an extent that we cannot enjoy the show (10-20 times in a 45 minute show). Pausing (to let the the buffer catch up) has zero effect.  So, I thought it was our wifi connection... perhaps it was lagging.  Nope.  Checked the speed and it was more than adequate.  Tonight when this was again occurring, I flipped over to the AppleTV and had no issue for the rest of that show, nor the next.I guess the Fire TV Stick will now be only used for Amazon Prime streaming.  Very, very disappointed in the performance.  I was hoping this would be the \"go-to\" connection, but it is really not up to the task.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "IronBeard \"broncodustin\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gerado"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So versatile and easy to move around hoping someday for a wireless version.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tina Wyatt"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Simple to use, and worth the money to have Amazon on my TV as well as all the other programs I like to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Susan"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "We can't get this to work.
