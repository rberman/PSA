Is it as good as the fire TV box.  No. But for less then half the price it does more the 75% as well. In my book that is a win. Perfect for the traveler that wants to bring his movies and shows with him. Love the fact that it automatically switches to it when I send a video from YouTube on my iPad (something my Apple TV doesn't do) on my Samsung TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Robert V Morgan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Replaced my Chromecast with this and it is literally the best thing ever. I love it so much and certain apps will still mirror", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I received the Fire Stick on December 8, 2014; here are my initial impressions. I'll try to update my review if I encounter issues, but so far it's been a breeze.--The device immediately found the available networks, i.e., within a few seconds.--Connecting to our home wireless network was simple; I selected the network, entered the password, and it connected immediately.--It found my Prime account, I confirmed the account name, and it initiated the update process. The updates took about two minutes (I timed it). After that, I was off and running. This was the easiest setup of a network device I've seen.--The included remote worked flawlessly and instantly. We've been connecting to Amazon on our other TVs with Panasonic Blu-Ray players, but the response time with the Fire Stick is far quicker.--Using the menu is intuitive (for me, at least, but I'm the one who always gets this job in our house--I've nicknamed myself the MOThR).--Scrolling through menu options, adding shows to my watchlist, etc., are all quick and easy.--UPDATE 12/9/2014: we wanted to access YouTube, which is on the supported app list. HOWEVER, YouTube is not one of the apps that shows up on the list by default. To access it, go to Apps-->Categories-->Entertainment and scroll through the list to find YouTube. Install it (free), and then it will show up on the list of your apps.Because another reviewer commented that they'd had to reset the Stick after powering the TV off without putting the Stick to sleep, I checked to see whether this one did so. It didn't; when I powered the TV on again, it went right to the Home screen. NOTE: getting to the \"Sleep\" option wasn't hard, but it's in the Settings menu. If it really is necessary to put the Stick to sleep when powering off, you should be able to do it from the main menu (I didn't look for it there, but there aren't that many options on the main menu). UPDATE 12/9/2014: After the TV was turned off overnight, I turned it on this morning and switched it to the input source where the Fire Stick was connected. Blank screen. Pressed the \"Home\" button on the Fire remote, and it came up almost instantly to the home page.So far, I'm loving it. I bought it to use with the only TV that doesn't have a Blu-Ray player attached, but I may end up getting another one for the big screen in the family room. Yes, it is Amazon-centric; but I bought it primarily to access our Amazon Prime account, so that's no big deal for me.If you haven't read cnet's review of the Fire Stick (cnet.com), I recommend that you do so. It may answer some questions you'll have to scroll through hundreds of Amazon reviews to find.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "madmak"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I tried the Chromecast device.
