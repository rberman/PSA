[{"rating": 2.0, "review": "Lets just say up front that I am very disappointed that my Fire TV Stick arrived nearly a week After I was able to buy on in the store, when I ordered it only a day after it was announced.Over all, I think this is a very nice steaming stick for the price.  More versatile than a Chromecast, and much faster and more more powerful than a Roku stick, at a better price.  Performance is not up to par with a full Fire TV, Roku, Apple TV, Nexus Player, or other $100 streaming device, but this is just over 1/3 the price, with nearly the performance in streaming and navigation, which is very impressive.  The increased processing power, RAM, and memory are all very helpful in placing the performance of the Fire TV stick much closer to the likes of the Fire TV than that of the Roku stick or a Chromecast.On the Con side is the annoying instance of the device to complain it it is not plugged into the wall wart it came with (it cites that not enough power will be supplied with other chargers).  On close inspection of the supplied charger, it provides 5V at 1.0A, which is the normal output of the majority of USB wall chargers. The wall charger I have ( the Anker 40W 5-Port High Speed Desktop USB Charger with PowerIQ Technology) is able to output up to 2.4 amps per port, and yet the Fire TV continues to nag that it needs the correct wall charger to get enough power.  If this is not solved with some sort of firmware or software update, I will be returning the device, as this is inexcusable.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "HI Soldier"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "When the chromecast came out I was a huge supporter of it. I loved not having to lose any precious space on my entertainment system. But quickly I got super tired of having to use my phone for every single thing, and soon I had switched back to watching content on my ps4 or Apple TV. The Fire Stick cures all those woes. It's small and unobtrusive. I love the remote. It feels more like an actual set top box than even my Apple tv does. I love being able to access prime content in an instant. You really get what you pay for in terms of content with it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brandon Farrington"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love how easy it is to move to different TV's.

We had been using our Wii to stream Netflix, and decided to test out Amazon's Fire TV stick because of the super price. I am impressed with the ease of set up, ease of using, and fast response. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the lack of an iOS app.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KrisMV"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I put it in a guest room so others can access their netflix.  I keep Fire TV in my main viewing area because I enjoy the option of optical sound output.  I can enjoy Fire TV via my home theater amp and bypass it completely if I like.  The Fire TV stick does not allow this option.  Fire TV can also be hard wired which is great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "WebER"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The best cheapest device in my opinion. I bought it for $20 during their sale and it just arrived.-Much faster than a chrome cast-Can still use iPhone to play videos from -YouTube using a 3rd party app(I think)-Clean design-Amazon prime instant video is included which is a plus because other devices cost around $99 or you need a smart tv/consoleI'm going to use this mainly for watching movies and videos so if you're looking for that, this device would be perfect at its budget.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Kamil Ahmad-Zani"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Exceeded my expectations.

But every since I have plugged it in it has struggled.  IT does not respond well and blamed it on my network.  Well I tested my network and it is performing great.  Everything else in my house wireless is great.  But not this.  It will not connect to Netflix and it is difficult to log into other apps.  I guess its great if all you wan to watch is prime.
