The set-up was very easy and within 10 minutes I was enjoying watching all my favorite prime videos, hulu plus and see thousands of more videos at my fingers reach. If you are looking for a gift for the guy who has everything I suggest buying the fire stick. This is a steal at $39 (I got mine for the special offer to Prime members for $19 but I gladly would have paid the full price. It is so nice not to have to tie up my computer to be able to enjoy videos on my bug screen. I do not own a tablet or ipad so I can not comment on the second screen feature offered with the fire stick but I assume it to would be a breeze to do. I would buy this product again and it is on the top of my list of buying as a gift for any need in the future. Thank you Amazon for being not only my favorite shopping site but also for developing reliable and awesome tech equipment. Amazon rocks and the prime membership is something that will always be my go to for not only shopping but for movie and tv entertainment (I am almost ready to stop paying that cable company's monthly bill which has become a rip-off for the shoddy service of an entirely overpriced product).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lauri"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Adequate, yet flawed.  The fire stick is an acceptable steamer by all rights, however, there are a few quirks left.  My biggest concern is with screen mirroring from android devices (Sony Xperia Z Ultra).  While attempting to stream the Fire stick would reboot itself almost 100% of the time, the times it would mirror correctly, the sound would not work (it has never worked, not once).  If screen mirroring was not a feature I would bump the score up dramatically, it is however a feature, one that doesn't work well.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert Kratz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great gadget, works great.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Roberto"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This product is great, and satisfied all of my needs and expectations.
