The support site that Google provides for Chromecast is not helpful either.

I have a old tv with vga in that is only 720p. Bought this & 3 different HDM-to-VGA adapters, but would not work as adapters tell Chromecast (CC) they can handle both 1080p & 720p streams, so CC chooses the best, ie 1080p to stream & my old TV just shows blank. Works great in my 1080p tv though. Wish CC will address this issue in the future by letting u select the stream quality manually under CC settings.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "brijeshsshah"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I use this all the time, very easy to use.
