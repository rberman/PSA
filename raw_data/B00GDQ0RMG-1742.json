I signed on to Netflix, so I get their movies. I signed on to Prime, but cannot view videos or download music (Amazon did warn about contents not being available outside the USA). So having bought and installed Fire Stick, I cannot get YouTube or History or any of the prime TV channels or other entertainment services. I know friends here who have other similar devices and enjoy full entertainment. Amazon really disappointed me with both Prime and Fire Stick. They should simply warn their customers who live outside the USA not to purchase these devices/services!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "Raffique Shah"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good piece of machinery.
