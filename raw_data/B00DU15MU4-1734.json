Mine is as thin as a sheet of paper and picks up all the stations from 35 to 40 miles. Go to antennaweb.org to find the free digital HD signals in your zip. With the Fire you need Hulu Plus to get current TV shows already recorded for you. Like the world's largest TiVo with 400 networks including the 40 most popular. You can watch many the next day and some a few days later but often the entire series for power watching. Never wait for a program to come on. Just simply select it and watch. You of course want to watch movies. And Prime will give you all you can watch and 2 day shipping as a bonus. For your over the air local shows, some day you are going to want to record when there are three good shows all at the same time. For that you might want a Channel Master DVR+. It uses an antenna connection and records in 1080p and uses a hard drive (or two) for hundreds of hours. There is no rush to buy a DVR and after you save on cable fees you will have so much extra cash. I cut the cable 5 years ago when the digital transition happened. The picture quality was better than the cable since there was no compression. Watching sports on the weekend and Nature on PBS it was like being there and my TV never looked so good. With Prime and Hulu Plus the cost is $16.20 and since there is no monthly fee to own as many Fire TV's as you want, might as well get more than 1. If you have the bandwidth, you can run 2 Amazon streams and 1 Hulu Plus at the same time. At The Same Time. I'm not a big fan of Netflix. But if you want their service, you can run 1 to 4 streams for 8 to 12/mo. For all of those who said that you need HBOGo...It's now available on the Fire TV.

The cable industry has set the price levels at a point that Amazon could dominate just be setting price points for local network access at reasonable levels.  The access to prime movies and other on-demand programming is a significant step toward that goal and is a tremendous program in and of itself.Overall a great job, but could be even better!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "ACS"}]
