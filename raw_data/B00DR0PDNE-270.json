While I had considered the Roku and other streaming media players this one linked right in well with all my Google life and Android phones. Its easy and simple to use plus I can add applications to it all the time either from my phone, tablet or computers. Ive been streaming movies to it from my desktop for quite a while and its nice that they even updated the added feature of pause and play through the TV's hdmi signal. I don't really have to get up now to pause unless its for a bathroom or snack break.I wish my TV provided the power to it so I didnt have to hook up the USB cable but oh well thats my TV not the Chromecast. This thing is great and for the price so worth the investment.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Brendan F."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Wish it also supported Amazon. :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeff B."}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I like my Amazon Fire Stick much better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Mark Shaffer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I used to watch Netflix, interconnecting my Galaxy Tab to the TV's hdmi port, with a cable. So I couldn't use my tablet to read, navigate, etc.Google Chromecast allows me to watch TV, while I'm reading or navigating, etc. Because I don't need to see in my tablet what is reproducing on my TV. If you do not have an smart TV, I recommend you Google Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the Chromecast for streaming Netflix!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nana"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is very easy to use.

No problems everything is working smoothly. I did want to try to clear up what seems to be an ongoing question and that is whether or not you can plug your ChromeCast into the usb port on your tv and draw power instead of having to plug it into an outlet. The answer to that question is YES. I am using my tv usb port instead of a wall outlet and I'm running just fine. EVERYONE I know who has ChromeCast also uses the usb port. I have a basic LED LG tv so I'm sure most sets are more advanced than mine so I don't think anyone else will have problems. Hope that helps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Richard Anthony"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Fantastic, made my dumb flat screen smart !", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Pedro Augusto Macedo de Souza"}]
