Heavily geared towards Amazon Prime/VOD services in it's layout. Apps can be installed via Amazon App store. I installed Plex, Netflix, Hulu and ESPN. I primarily use Plex. The issues I've had are as follows:If I launch the plex app, go to home screen to do something else or use another app, then go back to plex, all my libraries are gone. I have to hit menu/settings/refresh for it to \"rediscover\" my libraries. Turning on DD or DTS in plex and the firestick settings yields bizarre and \"slow-mo\" audio, even though my receiver and TV support it, and my other plex clients have no issue with it.Initial firmware seems buggy on setup. First attempt to attach to wifi just had it spinning trying to connect, had to reset. Subsequent reboots tell me I should plug into wall adapter for best results, even though it is plugged into supplied wall adapter with supplied cable.Wish it had IR support for universal remote (I know, line of site issues) but otherwise it's a great value.

The Chromecast operates in a completely different fashion by requiring another device (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.) to tell it what to play.  The Fire TV Stick on the other hand is basically just an app powered media player that can be controlled by another device.  The interface is pretty, but I wouldn't call it the fastest or easiest to use media interface I've used.  I think the old Sony PS3 ribbon interface still gets the prize for that in my book...Overall, I'm happy with the functionality of the Fire TV Stick.  However, it does have some flaws that are disappointing.  Here's what I've ran into...I had wanted to use this to listen to Prime Music on my home stereo.  I bought this hoping that it would be controlled using Amazon Music or another app on my phone so I wouldn't have to have my TV on (the Fire TV app is basically just another remote control if you haven't looked at it yet).  Once I realized that I couldn't control it like Google Play to the Chromecast, I got a bit more annoyed that the Fire TV Stick could only play Prime music that was added to my library from another device.  Unlike Prime Video where you can play whatever...I was hoping the display mirroring functionality would be better (more like Chromecast).  Having to go into settings and start listening for a connection is a bit slow to do...  Plus the connection sometimes doesn't initialize correctly (tried on several miracast enabled devices).  When you do get it to come up, it does work though.The item's description talks about video quality and speed.  Personally I haven't been impressed with the video quality or the speed at which videos come up.  When you start a video, it does take a second or two to start up (quicker than most), but when it starts it's very poor quality.  After a few seconds of payback the video finally reaches full quality.  I would rather watch a spinning clock or something then see a little bit of the video in poor quality, but that's just me I guess...When I first setup the Fire TV Stick, I plugged it into my receiver that's in an AV on the other side of the wall (about 10 ft away, if that).  Since it's bluetooth I didn't think it'd have any issues (other devices haven't).  However, the remote didn't work unless there were no walls or doors in the way.  I ended up plugging it into my TV directly to fix the problem so it wasn't a pain to setup.  However, now that it's setup I just use HDMI CEC through my TV to control it, so I could move it back to my receiver if I wanted.My biggest issue with it is actually the wireless.  It's dual band which is nice, but it seems to be a bit flaky.  Every once an a while it will just lose connection completely.  It will say that I can connect by going to the network settings, so I do.  Once this happens, it says \"Authentication Problem\" when I try to connect to either my 2.4 or 5 GHz networks.  If you're familiar with wireless, there's essentially 3 states...  Association, Authentication, and finally Connection (connection is where the system can actually communicate on the wireless network).  An authentication problem can indicate a wrong passphrase, but I know it's right since it was just connected a second before.  I know it's not my AP because it does this with two different models (just bought a new one), and the AP is located 20 ft away with line of sight so there shouldn't be any interference.  Anyway, it seems that either I have a bad Fire TV stick, the wireless subsystem/driver in the OS has a bug, or it just uses an unreliable wifi chipset.  The worst part about this problem is that it doesn't seem to correct itself without rebooting the device.  How do you reboot you might ask since there's no way to do it in software and no reset button?  You have to go pull the power...HOWEVER, this device definitely is not all bad.  If you have a Fire tablet or phone the Fire TV Stick is pretty cool.  I just got the Fire HDX for Christmas, but it does a lot of functionality like the Chromecast does with any Android device plus more.  The scene information is a pretty neat feature for when you're watching a movie.  You probably won't care about it if you've never seen the movie before though because you'll be paying attention to the movie.I have to say, if it weren't for the wifi issues, this would be a 4 star device.  I'd give it 5 stars if it could operate headless with Prime Music like a Chromecast can with Google Play.UPDATE 4/10:After a couple updates of the software I'm having fewer issues.  However, now I've started having very annoying speed issues.  The WiFi connection seems to be a bit more stable.  I've only had to \"reboot\" a couple times in the past few weeks (there really needs to be a reboot menu option).  But now it's occasionally very slow.  As in it can take minutes to get content when my Kindle Fire and Nexus are working just fine.  This may be related, but while watching videos it will just freeze for a second or two.  Very frustrating.  Some days are worse than others.  Again, none of my other devices have this problem.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "snike3 \"Tim\""}]
