I like the ease of playing videos/photos from any chrome tab to TV directly :-). I face disconnection sometimes but i figured out that was caused due to the reason that i was placing some mobile devices between laptop and TV which caused signal interruption. My video is good now after taking taking that out of its way.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chandrasekar Jayaraj"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I got one one of the first chromecasts that went on sale. I am a gadget lover and usually research a lot before buying any new product but this one was an instant buy. I heard the product announcement and had clicked the buy button within minutes. That is also in big part use to the low price and great set of features.My primary use case is streaming YouTube and Netflix on my tv. I could already do both from my tV apps as well as the XBox apps. But this just made it a lot easier to do and the ability to create playlists on the fly, searching for new content while still playing the current video is very useful.This is definitely one of my best gadget purchases of 2013.Disclaimer - I work for Google but do not work for the chromecast team.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sandeep"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works perfectly with all of my Android tablets and phones.

This set up and use was easy!!  This little gem is awesome and I had it hooked up and set up within a few minutes.  There was no long instruction manual or set up instructions - I handled it all from the three diagrams behind the front cover - plug into HDMI port on tv (the port was marked HDMI - who knew?), plug cord into electric outlet, then go to set up on ipad and download the app. Easy!  And I can now stream netflix to a tv in my basement in front of a treadmill and have something to watch without having to have cable or satellite.
