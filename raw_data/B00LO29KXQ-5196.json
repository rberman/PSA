[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I wanted it to stream Netflix and, specifically, Amazon Prime on my roommate's television. It does this perfectly. The picture is clean, it doesn't jam up the WiFi like Chromecast does, and the remote app for Android is super convenient.

I've had an Apple TV for years now and I actually prefer the fire stick over the Apple TV.  Easy to use and plenty to stream.  Great job Amazon!  I also had a Roku and I would say I like this over that too.  My Dad has a Roku as well and also prefers his Fire Stick over that.  It's also cheaper than both Roku and Apple TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carla"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "They are really great and easy to use but ever since we started using these (we got 2 for 2 different tv's) we've had problems withour Wi-Fi reception.  Sometime everything works great, but other times in middle of streaming we get cut off, or video keeps spooling.  I checked with our provider and they say speed of our router is good, so I'm not sure if these sticks use too much power.

Absolutely love it! I bought my wife a TV for her sewing room, for Christmas. I choose the Fire TV stick because of Amazon Prime. I couldn't be happier with it. Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu Plus all on an extra TV. It was cheaper than spending an extra $100 for a smart TV. The Fire TV Stick turned her TV into a smart TV for less than 1/2 the price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "girard roberson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product, next I will buy the Fire TV to compare.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "BarbaraJean"}]
