The tutorial is also of excellent quality.  I was somewhat dismayed to feel or sense that the Prime movie offerings seemed to grow smaller or more limited.  I may be incorrect in that opinion, but it also seems that the rental pricing has also trickled \"UP\".  I would like to offer a couple of simple recommendations for improving the Fire TV Stick kit.  I would like to see a remote designed for the older, more elderly user with limited understanding of such wonderful technology.  A remote with larger buttons, that automatically light up as the light in the room darkens.  I bought the Fire TV Stick for my Mom, no win her 70's and while she just loves the concept and technology, the ability to \"fully enjoy\" it is lacking and I am frequently called over to help her use and navigate the device.  I hope more companies quickly learn, that as people grow older, their products need to be much more \"aging user\" friendly.  Overall though, I am well pleased with it and I hope Amazon continues its fantastic drive to improve and innovate.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Karl P"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works as advertised.
