The one thing I found to be a problem is that the charging cord to the stick, which the directions recommend you leave plugged in all the time, is not nearly long enough. Most TVs are not that close to a power source, so I had to run an extension cord in order to make it work. This cost them a star in this review. I would also have liked VUDU to be available through the Fire TV Stick.  I did own a Google Chromecast device, which does have VUDU but does not have Amazon Prime, which I watch much more.  Overall, I like the Fire TV Stick much better than Google Chromecast, which had a few other issues (such as stopping it from casting), and I would definitely recommend it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Deb H"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "robert e purnell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing.
