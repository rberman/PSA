[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "This is a great Streaming device. Very easy to set up. big buffer so hesitations are almost nonexistent. Menus scroll fast . when you first start it up there is short walk through video to explain the operation. My only complaint and hence the 4 stars is the remote. Size is fine its the color . A Black case with Black buttons. Make it hard to find on my Black couch/ Black rug in a dark room.  They could have at least made the buttons white or the case Grey . I got tired of looking for it with a flashlight so I painted it. Otherwise great device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "George S"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it.
