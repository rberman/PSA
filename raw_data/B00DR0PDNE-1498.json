It is so easy to set up and use, if you have a flat screen and a smart phone or tablet, you should definitely get one. I find myself watching a lot more YouTube videos than I ever thought I would.

I use a Google (Samsung) Nexus 10 tablet and a Samsung Galaxy S 4 phone - on BOTH devices I use the YouTube application to cast videos to my TV. Half the time the ChromeCast application cannot find the physical ChromeCast device even though I am standing less than 5 feet away from it and my wireless signal is at full bars (close to 100%). When I finally do make a connection and try to cast a YouTube video it will work sometimes, but mostly (about 80% of the time) it will fail with a Brain Freeze error and then I have to reset everything to get it working again...! I have changed out the physical ChromeCast device with 2 other devices yet I still get the same error.
