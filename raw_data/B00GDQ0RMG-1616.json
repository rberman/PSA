[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "My first ever product review. Was hesitant to purchase due to a few poor reviews however I'm blown away by this. Buying a smart tv was a waste of money. Wish we had this first!! You CAN search PRImE video easy. Very fast connection whereas my smart tv would buffer forever if it would connect. We are using this on an outside TV without any problems.
