[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "As it is with all products made by Apple, this was very easy to set up. It took my boyfriend like probably all of 3-5 minutes to set it up and have Netflix streaming over our Wi-Fi network on the TV! How awesome! The Apple TV is compact, really small for what it does, not that it makes a difference because it's kept in our cabinet. But anyway. The remote is super sleek though I do wish it had additional functionality while watching movies. But overall for what the product does, it is great and is just what we had been looking for. Thank you Apple!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Baimeinhvn"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "There are two bad things about this Apple TV(1) When I play YouTube, and I hit the history video, it always shows the title image of that video and then show \"This video is not available\"  If I type the video site directly, I can get it. I am sure this is Apple's software bug. This never happen when I use PC.(2) It is very difficult to type the characters and numbers. Not very user friendly.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "Yung Chen"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was first doubting whether or not this purchase is unnecessary because I have a laptop connected to my TV and a PS3.  I can stream Netflex, music, movie, Pandora, any content from my laptop. PS3 can also perform many tasks as well.  What caught my attention to purchase this item is the wireless streaming ability with iPhone, iPad and MacBook Air.  I found myself streaming from my iPhone and Macbook Air most of the time.  I do not have to walk over and turn on my laptop and use a wireless keyboard. Yes, you can call me lazy, but the fact is Apple TV makes it so much more convenient.  I am not a Hulu user or a big time YouTube fan, but this is added value to the people who use it.Here is my opinion on each device that I own that I stream to Apple TV.iPad: Perfect streaming without delayiPhone: Good for streaming music.  Video is acceptable if the content is low in resolution.MacBook Air: Good for browsing, music, and the video is definitely lagging at original resolution. There is an option to lower the resolution, but it is a troublesome to switch back and forward.  I believe Apple can improve their coding overtime.My recommendation is if you own any iDevices this would be the perfect compliment to it.  This item is definitely not worth it if you do not have iDevices.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Chillmeow"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It's amazing. love my Apple TV.

I have become an \"On Demand\" kind of guy, and I have lost my patience concerning TV programming.  It is difficult for me to wait a full week to find out what happened on my favorite show, so I don't anymore.  This Apple TV unit makes it easy!  I can choose a show that I like and watch an entire season's worth in one evening if I wish.  I can use Netflix or other apps to find movies, documentaries, or other programs.  I can go to Itunes and rent movies without having to return them or worry about sending them back to whichever service they came from.  My kids' favorite things to watch are on YouTube, and that makes them happy.  It takes up a tiny amount of space under my TV, and it works wonderfully.  If you are like I was and are on the fence, my advice to you is to BUY THIS PRODUCT!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "donald sharpe jr."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "El apple tv lleg\u00f3 a tiempo y bien empaquetado.
