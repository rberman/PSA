I have an iPhone and it works extremely well with that as well. The chrome cast takes being lazy to a whole new level!! I literally go on my phone. Put on Netflix and still text and even watch YouTube videos while Netflix plays. Also when your chrome cast is idle it displays such beautiful pictures. I honestly use the tv and chrome cast as a picture frame when I am not using it. And it doesn't come off tacky at all! I think it's the next must have!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeffery Hou"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Bought my first Chromecast in July 2013, it just works and keeps getting better as new features are added.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Raymond Smith"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this little gadget", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Debra Flores"}]
