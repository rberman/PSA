I'm still working with this and hoping I can get better at using it, and hoping it works better along the way! But I really think it has some bugs, that's why I gave it 4 stars.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MMCher \"M\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy setup. Very intuitive.
