Much programing is available that is available elsewhere but it is all combined in one resource.  For example a mini series loses continuity when you see an episode a week or maybe a month.

So simple to move from our TV screen at home to our screen at our small cabin. Didn't want to invest in cable at our cabin because we're just not there that much.

I never had any problems with the Roku; I was just tired of seeing all those wires.  I actually bought two Fire TV Sticks.  The one I hooked up in our living room only works some of the time.  It randomly pauses the show I'm watching, when I'm not even touching the remote.  It will also freeze up frequently, requiring me to unplug it from the TV, wait awhile and try it again.  Sometimes I have to do this 3 or 4 times before it will begin working again.  It's like there's a glitch in it or something.  While it's nice not having all the wires of my previous Roku, the quality of this product seems to less than optimum.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tiffany A.

I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to convert their TV to a smart TV, particularly people with an Amazon Prime account.  I have never had a smart TV, so I cannot say how it compares in performance, but I really doubt it will beat the Fire TV Stick.  I also found that it was cheaper to buy a non-smart TV and then buy this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Thomas Elder"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Worth the money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "AJM1979"}]
