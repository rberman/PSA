[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "For those who want a bottom line: This device works excellently with apps that support it directly (i.e. Netflix, YouTube, etc.), but the quality of the tabbed streaming and playing of local files is going to depend on your Internet connection speed and how you're using Chromecast.To reiterate in more detail, Netflix and YouTube are absolutely beautiful on Chromecast. It's seamless, and the interface is pretty convenient, although I've had a couple frustrations pausing videos using my tablet or laptop after they've gone into sleep mode. I've been using Chromecast for Netflix over my Roku 2, since it's capable of streaming in 1080p.A popular complaint I've read about Chromecast is its inability to directly stream local files, but a simple workaround is to drag the desired file onto a Google Chrome tab, and stream it to Chromecast that way. That said, I have found the quality of the tab casting to be pretty hit or miss. I've been using Chromecast for a little over a week, and in the beginning I was casting in \"high\" quality, the middle of three options. With these settings, I noticed a bit of a sound lag. Other people I was watching with said they didn't see it, but it bothered me. Sometimes the lag was more significant, making it almost unwatchable for me.After doing some reading, I attached the small extension that the device came with and bumped the quality down to \"standard,\" and since then I haven't seen much of a lag. The picture quality took a small hit, and sometimes the sound is off for a short time, but overall it's much better.All that having been said, I am quite pleased with Google Chromecast. I am also getting a converter so I can hook my computer directly to my TV in case of further frustration or reception issues, but I expect to use Chromecast much more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Sarah"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "This device gives us options.

It is easy to set up, and works for a limited set of services. Would be much more useful if you could throw anything on your phones screen to the TV instead of only certain applications.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dale \"DaleDJ\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "We had this for a few weeks. We couldn't stand it. It was pretty clunky and we couldn't get the thing to cut on or work half the time. We ended up returning it and going with the Apple TV instead. We're happy we switched, even though it's a little bit more money.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Corey Jones"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Google's Chromecast is a nice device for around $35. You can plug it into an HDMI port on your big screen/HDTV (NOTE: You MUST also plug in the included power adaptor to supply constant AC when using to \"cast\" to you big screen). Works very nicely to cast Netflix and YouTube from iPad mini to Chromecast connected HDTV. Cannot cast Amazon Prime or (oddly) Chrome for IPad yet... Hopefully more apps will become compatible soon...

I bought two of these, one for my husband and one for my son and while it's great at casting youtube videos from computer or phone to an hdtv, it's use is limited for me because I don't subscribe to any pay service available now on chromecast.  I'm hoping Amazon Videos and Prime videos are added to it's functionality very soon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nicole Nicole \"mommy111\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I couldn't get it to work. I have a Comcast modem and router, and tried changing the settings around. I ended up giving it away to somebody. They were able to set it up and loved it.

It eliminates the need for a smart TV.  I will be buying 2 more for the other tvs in my house.Pros: Easy set up (5 min).  Netfilx and HBO Go are awesome.  I generally use my phone as a remote, very handy.Cons: Can be powered by a USB on your TV, but I do not have that, so I powered it by plug in (equipment included).  I use Chrome browser on my laptop, and it broadcasts your chome screen, but has a bit of a delay.  I really only use it for the recommended apps.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bill Weber"}]
