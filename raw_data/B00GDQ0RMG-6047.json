[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I had a few problems with getting this to work, but a little troubleshooting and I was up and running with no trouble. First, if you have WiFi, I'm sure you know your password. I can't believe how many people don't. I have it recorded in my cell phone as a \"contact.\" I had to hook this up to my television in my bedroom, because my Sharp HD in the living room doesn't have the necessary connector.At first I couldn't get it to work; only the word \"Amazon\" was showing on the screen. But when I used the included extender connector, everything worked fine. It was easy peazy from then on out. I made some popcorn, settled in and watched 6 episodes of Penny Dreadful, something I've been waiting to do since I lost it on my DVR in September.I love the fact that the instructions that come with the unit are extremely non-daunting and simple, and that everything you'll need, including the batteries, is in the package.Just keep that \"No Fear\" attitude and you should be enjoying another great product from Amazon in no time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Annabelle"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Very simple and just works.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "LOL"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

I also have an Apple tv, amazingly different experience.1)  Drops network connection CONSTANTLY.2)  Won't allow me to watch R rated shows on HuluPlus even though I have set parental controls to OFF and HuluPlus does not even have a parental control setting!  Unbelievable.3)  Didn't even come with HuluPlus downloaded - I had to download the app then set it up.  With Apple TV I just clicked on it and registered the device - everything worked fine.This is the sorriest piece of garbage and I am pretty sure I\"ll never actually use it after spending about an hour this morning trying to get around it's clunky interface.

I think its a great start but it seemed sluggish.  The Youtube app DID have a pairing option to use your smartphone to type things in via a smartphone keyboard.. havent tried that but it seems like a possible solution.  Other than that still totally useable and totally an amazing value to be able to watch streaming content on my tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Adam Stogdill \"-Adam\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "A solid addition to any TV, the Fire TV Stick blows it's competition out of the water. Great performance, competent design, and a good price point.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is excellent tool for streaming content to the T.V.  It could not have been easier to set up.  I also have a Roku 3 and, a Google Chrome.  I think the Fire TV stick is going to be my favorite.  I have an Amazon Prime membership and, the way it presents the content I already have purchased through Amazon and, what is available free with my membership is terrific.  I am most excited that it makes Prime Music easily playable on my home entertainment system.  I was able to get this as the early Prime member discount but, it really is worth full price.  Content is easy to find and, I will be purchasing controllers to be able to play the games.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Gracie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Pretty pleased with the device thus far.  What I initially purchased it for was to take advantage of my amazon prime and netflix account without casting from (tying up) another device.  The remote was the deal breaker for me which will pretty much put my chromecast to the strap yard.  It gets pretty tiresome trying to wake up the chromecast device at times to stream to it.  What i didn't realize is that the fire tv stick has the capability to cast to it as well with allcast receiver app which was free to download.  So not only do I have a remote that I can directly access apps I can still cast anything from phones or tablets with allcast.  A feature that i have yet to try but I'm sure will work pretty good is the phone app that allows you to say the name of movie titles or tv shows from phone or tablet voice capability instead of pressing the remote a bunch of times for onscreen keyboard brilliant idea.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "datmanty \"PWNED\""}]
