In just a few minutes I was 'casting' a tab of my laptop's Chrome browser onto my TV via the local wi-fi network. So it's not strictly for YouTube or even just video. Really you can project any website or the output of any file that can be displayed through your browser. Therefore, it should also function as a setup for presentations involving projection of PDF documents, JPG photos, etc.I also tried casting YouTube successfully using an iPod Touch (G5) and a Nexus 7 tablet with good results, though the OIS device got a bit warm after a few minutes.The one major caveat is that this arrangement seems to be unusually sensitive to network disruptions. I'm not sure what the data routing looks like under the hood, but the impression I get is that data traffic is being multiplied on the local wifi network as it passes first through the device being used for web navigation and 'casting' and then back over the wifi to the target TV. any CPU, memory or network adapter issues with that traffic doubling will show up as glitches on the TV. It means that the device being used for casting should probably be considered 'unavailable for other usage while in use -- i.e. surfing on your laptop's non-casting tabs while also casting, or taking a phone call while your iPhone is casting is likely to create glitches on the TV.The other caveat is if your casting device is battery powered you'd better have it plugged into a charger because the rate of battery drain will shock you..", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Steven G"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product.
