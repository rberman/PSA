We absolutely love the processor speed, RAM (memory) capacity, HD picture, and overall 'look-and-feel' of the device and remote, as well as features like the 'instant next' which loads the next episode while your still watching the current one.At first purchase, the software was... wonky. I would get occasional errors related to OS work which required restarts, and some apps would 'loose' login data, and needed to be closed (or forced to stop), which is complicated and not intuitive to find out how to do (it's in app settings).I really like the FireTV app for Droid/OSX that can completely replace the remote(!) and has added features like voice search, for no extra fee Or hardware.It would be better if it were more popular, and more networks would license their content to FireTV. It would be easier to use if every app was requires by Amazon to use the same keyboard layout (some are qwerty, some are abcde, some are, 5x6 squares, some are 1x26 in a line).I'm only withholding the 5th star due to the somewhat 'klunky' interface and desire for more content.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joseph Clatterbuck"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this fire stick. It was temporarily out of stock when I place my order. It arrived earlier than expected. The setup was easy with that animated intro plus it was already connected to my account to watch my prime TV/movies. I own a Roku and Comcast but the Fire stick has lots of games for my grandkids.

Buy way more than I should on here. But this thing is a piece of $h1t.... I have great Internet service and all of my other electronics have no problem but whenever I try to use Hulu, WWE, or MLB this thing lags, loses service or freezes! It's my fault for buying a cheap piece of crap  I guess.
