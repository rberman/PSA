[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "BIG MISTAKE.....DO NOT DO THE SAME JUST DO NOT PURCHASE FIRESTICK....we found out that it will not work without a router according to\"tech\" and could not accept wifi with sprint either.....IF all of these properties are in charge, why not let consumers know in advance of purchase...we are truly angry and made repeated efforts to Amaaon for tech help. calls were not returned and advice on phone was ridiculous, they asked us more questions that answers.....did not know what a \"hot spot' device was with wifi...kept stating we needed router....well, another 150$ for another service to do this? Why do they continue to sell and distribute an item that is non functioning to begin with, it buffers constantly and cannot accept1 min of movie on Amazon Prime.....horrible and sadly misrepresented to public and this is shameful considering Amazons past good reputation..this item needs to be removed and accepted as it is......WORTHLESS. DO NOT INVEST IN IT.....if this product is so great, why does it not work....many many have same issues....we have high speed internet which is what Amazon states is ALL that is required...we have  that...now they state it has to be Cox or Century link.....we are so worn out and tired...who runs the quality and tech care????? does anyone have knowledge for us....would so appreciate techs could not find any answer except to return item and they said that over and over....no help just send it back.......thanks for any help.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Lives with cats"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've had the Fire Stick since they came and they're awesome.
