[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "I'm a bit upset with the deception and maybe it is user error but some of the new releases (on Amazon) are showing as a purchase option only through the fire tv stick and if you go to the website or through roku, there are rental options. Nowhere do I see rental options for some of the new releases on the fire stick. An example is The Good Lie. I only had purchase options for this movie, so I purchased the movie. After the movie I went to IMBD to read a little more about it and noticed IMBD links you back to Amazon where you get the option not only to purchase but also to rent. I feel tricked and don't trust what I see through the fire stick anymore. Going back to the roku, it works fine and I feel like there isn't a deception or a push to purchase And if I am wrong, I will change my review but that is what I am seeing as of 12/28/14.As far as the device itself, I've only used it for Amazon video's and it is working fine, just got netflix up and running and it's okay too.I like how the stick plugs into the back of the TV so you don't have to provide a space for something on the table or counter.Other than feeling like I was deceived and not shown all options available, I would recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Miss Read \"Maggie\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "good", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jamie"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Perfect", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "John Giardina"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Got it on the promotion and really like it.

I am planning on ordering a few now as gifts.  Becauseof the position of my tv, I had a slight hiccup with the signal at first.

This device replaced my other similar devices. The remote is very useful.  Better than that is the android app that takes voice commands.  The mousepad style control in the app is also very cool.  So it seems that what ever type of control you like you are capable of finding it in the form of the remote or the app.With Amazon apps you can get a variety of apps instantly.However what this device lacks that I would like to see is a way to mirror my main screen.  If I had this also in the firestick I would no longer need my screen beam.  I would like that very much.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "D. Rickard \"DanTravels\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Update - I moved the Fire TV Stick to a room where it is closer to the router. It works much better there. My overall opinion is that this is a good device for streaming, but you need to have a strong, reliable signal nearby. The price and options make it very attractive, but you need to consider placement in regards to your wi-fi signal.I have 4 instant watch devices. This is the slowest one and the Fire TV stick has the most difficulty getting the wi-fi signal. When it works, it's pretty good. But, it is slower than the Roku, Apple TV, and smart TV. It is annoying to have each viewing stop multiple times and then restart.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paintrock \"paintrock\""}]
