However, out of the box, the WIFI would not work.  Well, it would get an address from my router, and responded to pings, but the device itself couldn't get network time or log into iTunes, or anything of that sort, so was only good for Airplay.I finally had to connect it to iTunes, and restore to the latest version of the OS.After that, it still wouldn't work wirelessly, but after a restart it did work on a wired link.  The next day I was able to pull the wired link, restart it again, and it now works on wireless.Really a pain, and I was starting to think it was defective.  It wasn't, but it's not an ideal first impression, so I have rated it four stars instead of five.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "The Big Blind Technofile"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Does it come with a remote", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "erick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "ok", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "jesus f guadelis c"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love my Apple TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bridget N.
