It is probably a good product but, we bought it for use in hotel rooms. Just received it yesterday and checked into our hotel today. Found out that hotels are now blocking use of the Fire Stick by disabling the input button on the TV. We would not have bought it if we had known you could not use it in hotels. We are staying at a Marriott. We travel a lot and were looking forward to using our Fire Stick. May return it if we can. It is useless to us.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "B.
