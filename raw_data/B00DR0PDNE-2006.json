Chromecast now has support for most major streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO Go, and YouTube, plus it supports Plex beautifully for watching your personal media library. You can actually take this with you when you travel -- setup on new devices takes seconds. I have had no problems streaming 1080p files on this. And the price is about a third of what Roku 3 or AppleTV will cost you. Absolutely essential device for video lovers.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jake Fantom"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I use this to stream HBO GO to my TV and it works flawlessly.

You can queue and watch youtube videos, Netflix, Hulu Plus, ESPN, stream music from Pandora, Rdio, and more applications will stream to your TV from your other device. If you plug the Chromecast into the wall, by hitting cast in one of the apps, your TV gets turned on and automatically changes to the right HDMI channel. However, if you can't/don't want to plug it into the wall, you can power the Chromecast from the TV if it has a USB port on the TV. When the TV is powering the Chromecast, you can't power on the TV by hitting cast.When streaming from your computer and not a dedicated app, there is a slight delay, but it's detected and the audio and video get realigned pretty well. The quality is much better when using a supported app, so when possible, do that.I have thoroughly enjoyed my Chromecast for streaming online content and have bought some for gifts for other people. I highly recommend it if you want to watch Netflix or ESPN (and more) on your entertainment setup instead of a phone or computer.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Cody"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Works well with programs like You Tube,  but still waiting (7 months later) for the software that will allow you to throw computer screen and programs on the TV", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Chuck D.
