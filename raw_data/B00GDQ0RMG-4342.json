[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome product for the price. Provides excellent audio/video resolution on all the plasma and/or LCD screens we have. Very small and transportable--I move it around from TV to TV in the house and plan to take it with me when I visit family members. Never any performance lags in video playback. It's a fun entertainment \"tool\" and fun to experiment with.The only negative comment is that there is  not a lot of documentation on how to install other apps on the TV stick. I've installed a few--some work and some don't. Not sure what that's the case, but as I said, documentation is somewhat lacking.I received this as a gift, but would definitely recommend buying one to provide additional entertainment capabilities and a very low price point.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The fire stick is awesome!

Only drawback is if you have a external sound system you will need to go to the T.V.'s sound system. I can not figure out how to make it work with my surround sound.

Best amazon prime integration, but also plays Netflix and other video apps quite well.  Just wish when the internet connection was down that I could still stream to my TV via Fire Stick from my phone or computer.  Otherwise excellent device and does what it does quite well.
