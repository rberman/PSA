He has a particular movie app whereby he gets to see many movies. We thought the chromcast would have been able to allow us to see the movie from the phone, on our tv. No. You can see you tube stuff and other Google approved stuff. Truly not what I thought it would do. Nowhere does it say that it streams particular apps.
