Wants to tie everything in with google.  You can't even watch your home movies or play music without some convoluted step of streaming them to the internet and then downloading them again.  Tried to watch a youtube music video, it would either play on my phone or on my TV or it would crash or otherwise be a pain in the arse.You have to have it tied to your phone.  Tried it for a weekend and am returning now.  Will be buying another ROKU stick to replace this featureless and buggy dongle", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Dave"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Good purchase and amazing quality.
