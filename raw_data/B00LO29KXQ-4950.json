I can honestly say that even at $40, this would be a good value.Our Sony blu ray player has streaming, which was used primarily for our Amazon Prime streaming. I really bought the Fire TV Stick just to play with and also to try the phone mirroring feature.The phone mirroring first... This is the main reason I am writing this review - to let others know...I have a Galaxy S3 from Verizon with Android KitKat (4.4.2). I have only seen a few reviews talk about phone mirroring form an S3, and it seems they say it did not work...  Not sure why, as I have used it multiple times and it has been flawless. Simply turn on mirroring on the fire TV (settings menu, must be done each time you want to mirror) and then turn on screen mirroring on your S3. Let them find each other, and all is good. Both steps need to be done each time...As for my Sony blu ray streaming, compared to the new Fire TV stick. The Fire TV Stick is, without a doubt, faster to load and start programs. Amazingly so, actually... And, for what it's worth, the Sony blu ray is wired to our network, and the Fire TV Stick is, obviously, wireless. And still the Fire TV Stick easily outperforms the Sony.In case you care (and even if you don't...) I am not using the included USB power block but rather have the USB plugged in to the Sony blu ray's USB port since it is also the sound system for our setup. It works fine and starts up when we turn on the TV and sound system. We did not even get any type of warning message that other reviews have mentioned.Finally, it is small enough to move easily to other TV's if the need / desire arises...So... In summary...A) Screen mirroring DOES work with the Galaxy S#B) the thing is fast and is worthwhile even if you have other streaming optionsC) portability is another plusAll in all, easily 5 stars....", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mildewman"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The internet connection isn't great with this device.

Love it!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Victoria"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Most of my experience is covered in other reviews and the Fire TV Stick is very nice as a streaming media device. I got mine because Apple TV does not have any Amazon services and I use Amazon Music a LOT.My main knock on the Fire TV Stick is the volume difference between music and video playback. This is because sound for music and television/movies are produced at different reference levels. Music is always produced to be as \"loud\" as possible while television/movies are designed for consistent listening at reasonable levels. This is the same reason why DVDs are always \"quieter\" than CDs.Anywho, switching from using Amazon Prime Video to Amazon Music is a most jarring experience. I've had to apologize to my neighbor more than once -it blasted so loud... My Apple TV doesn't have this particular problem. It's not really a hard fix, lower the output volume in the Amazon Music app on the Fire TV Stick and everything's good.Edit - I've installed the YouTube App and it is very sluggish. I'm not sure if that's because the program is poorly coded (likely) or what. I just wanted to leave that as an FYI in case anyone really, really loves watching YouTube videos.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JP"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "We keep having connection issues.
