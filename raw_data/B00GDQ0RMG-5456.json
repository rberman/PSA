Of course, any games running on the PS4 tend to use the entire CPU and GPU to do anything, so you can't actually stream video on a PS4 while the CPU is in use playing a game. The solution is a Fire TV stick, Chromecast, Roku Stick, or so-forth.Of the 3, Chromecast requires a phone or tablet, and doesn't really support Amazon Instant Video. Roku is the most versatile, but the most expensive. The kicker for me was when Amazon offered the FireTV Stick at $19 for Prime customers. That got me to buy pre-order it.Installing the device was a cinch. Plug in the HDMI extender, plug in the Stick, plug in the power supply that's a micro-USB port, and you're done! The device supports Amazon Music, TuneIn, Pandora, and Spotify, as well as playing back Photos and Videos from Amazon's cloud. This is a very nice setup, with the biggest disappointment being that there's no support for DLNA, which is what I actually use at home. There are various apps that claim to support DLNA, but what really happens is that they're really apps for throwing content over from the phone to the stick, rather than a full-on DLNA client, so this doesn't quite make up for the PS4 not being as powerful a media server as the PS3.The UI is fast, and better yet, you can pair your phone via WiFi to the stick and not have to use the remote for text entry. Voice search even sort of mostly works. Playing an Amazon instant video is smooth and quick, though there's missing support for VUDU.For me, the biggest problem is that there's no separate sound output, so you can't get surround sound if you the output from the TV downgrades surround to stereo, which is what most non-Sony TVs do.All in all, the FireTV Stick is a better device than the Chromecast, but not nearly as good as the Roku Stick or standalone players. This is disappointing because from the specifications, the stick is a far more powerful device than any of the other sticks.All in all, at $19 (cheaper than any of the other sticks by far), it's worth while to have as a backup for the scenario I mentioned in the first paragraph above. At full price, I'd give this a pass.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Piaw Na"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Very good for the price and the content but very messy interface.

We bought this to be a portable option for streaming shows throughout the house.  Unfortunately, it keeps getting network errors where it says it's connected to Wi-Fi, but problems exist.  Our two year old Roku XD outperforms the Fire TV Stick in every room in the house.  To me it seems like Amazon is still figuring it out where Roku has been doing it for years.  Even though we got the Fire TV Stick for only $20, we are going to return it and get another Roku.We were mainly plugging the Fire TV Stick in the USB ports on the TVs.  If it supposedly works better to plug it into a wall then to me that defeats the purpose of having a stick vs. a box.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "mommy pick"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to hook up! Hardest thing was trying to get the remote open to put the batteries in. We cancelled our subscriptions to all the pay movie channels since we rarely watched them. We purchased Prime so we can watch movies that we want to watch and TV series.  Even the movies to purchase are cheaper than what we would pay through our satellite dish provider.

We have 2 rokus and 3 Chromecasts.  I added this to a new 50 inch LG TV that we placed in the bedroom.  I actually like this better than the Chromecast and the Roku!  Why?....because of the remote control and remote voice search android application.  They will be adding a remote application for IOS soon.  I also like the fact that you can play some games on it.  The menus are good enough and the free prime movies are clearly indicated on the movie thumbnails.  I also think that the streaming works better than my Roku and if you go to the home screen and leave for awhile it reverts to displaying beautiful photos on my TV that are much nicer than the Chromecast photos.  I'd like to see them add more apps to it like TED.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "FrankK"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is the perfect companion to any HDMI pug and a smart TV along with its Chromecast buddy plugged next to it!
