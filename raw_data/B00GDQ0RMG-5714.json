As a result I can get 5.1 audio from Netflix, while Chromecast has only stereo.2) The remote is very responsive. It is more convenient to use remote to navigate the Netflix app on a large screen of your TV/projector than having to unlock your phone and navigate a Netflix app there on a tiny screen in order to cast a move on Chromecast.Fire stick cons:1) Grey overcast. Main menu and all apps including Netflix look washed out. Black screen is actually grey.2) Amazon fire tv remote app on my phone is not able to connect to Fire stick. This is not a big deal since I prefer to use remote for naviation.I would give it five stars if grey overcast is removed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "V"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Pretty Good... My Fire TV Stick double enters characters from the on screen keyboards. I will keep this system though, as I will only use the keyboards to enter app creds. More - the double entry effects selection on the ribbons. 1 out of 5 times it jumps 2 places. Both horizontally and vertically. I down-voted to 3 stars. If I return it, it may be a long time to replace, so I'll put up with the key bounce (or what ever it is).Could use a common keyboard style. Qwerty vs ABC, common layout of special keys. I like the remote shortcuts, something Roku could adopt. User interface is satisfactory, nothing noteworthy. Focus of the GUI is on Amazon Instant Video, I would prefer the GUI be more generically focused on Videos, Music, Apps, etc.Video performance is good, as good as Roku 3 playing Waking Dead S01e03.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Gunslinger45"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "It awesome but I wish most of movies and shows don't cost money to watch", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "michael peak"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Netflix app don't work on brasil.

Received yesterday already registered to me.  Thankfully my TV had a USB port so I plugged Fire Stick in TV HDMI port and power cord into TV's USB port so no visible wires.  Device had several setup and how to use videos ready to go.Obviously optimized to buy and watch Amazon videos, it also makes an excellent picture slideshow and music player.  I had already bought and/or uploaded some of my music library to Amazon so I added my favorite family photos to Amazon cloud drive.  QED now I have a 46\" electronic picture frame showing my photos and playing my music.I bought during the initial pre-order so the price was excellent.
