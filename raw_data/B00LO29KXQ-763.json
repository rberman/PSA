It sets up in a matter of minutes and is a breeze to use. I do wish the remote was a little bigger.The cord is just long enough as well.

I was not aware that the Fire TV stick had to be in close proximity to my Wi-Fi router, a mention of which should be added in lay terms to the sales description. Since my computer / TV set up does not allow for that close proximity it kept dropping the connection to the point  of being too annoying to constantly reset the Fire TV stick. Since I am not a tech person, I also did not know that there are gadgets that will boost my Wi-Fi signal throughout the home (Amazon customer service also did not mention these gadgets, which is surprising since it would make them extra sales) until after I already returned the Fire TV stick. Now that I know how to improve the Wi-Fi signal, I will definitely give the Fire TV another try.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "c reynolds"}]
