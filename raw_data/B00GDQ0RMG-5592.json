I thought that I would buy this during the $19 sale for a second TV. After being told that I wouldn't receive it until next year, then Christmas Eve, I finally got it yesterday. I tried plugging it into my TV and started the setup. However, when I got to the connect to a network screen, that's when I had problems. It didn't find my network, and further more, the menu wouldn't even show up. All I had was a blank screen, and when I tried to use the remote, I heard it clicking as if it was working, but nothing still would not show up on the screen. Tried resetting it as the support page suggested with no luck. Tried it on another TV with the same results. Amazon usually makes good products, but I don't know what happened with this.

I could use it normally on Amazon.com but for some reason Fire Stick wasn't recognizing it.
