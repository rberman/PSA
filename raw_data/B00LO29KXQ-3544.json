I travel a lot and all I need is an internet connection and I can watch Netflix, Hulu, and any other station they have an app for and I have an account with.

Had trouble setting it up because it doesn't tell you where your password can be found.  I had to call my tv company.  Once I had it set up.

If you can set it up for someone who is tech-unfriendly, all you have to teach them is how to point the controller at it and how to get to the apps they use (netflix, hulu, amazon instant most likely).For others who are tech friendly it offers a decent suite of applications of varying quality, plus access to all your photos saved on Amazon's Cloud.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
