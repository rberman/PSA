[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "We LOVE it!!!!  This replaced a Vizio box and has a lot more choices and is so much easier to use.  I had to have someone set up the Vizio (we aren't techies) but I was able to set up and figure out how to use the Stick in less than 30 minutes.  With my Amazon Prime we will probably get rid of cable.  Yay!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Terri Haldeman"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This was so easy!

Coupled with an HD antenna, you can serve most viewing needs in my opinion, especially for those stuck working away from home and in an apartment for an extended period. No termination fee!Program choices are good, 1080p is sufficient; Firestick is a great value buy.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SalvageDiver"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I LOVE THE FIRE STICK!!!This loads up FAST!

Great price and I love it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Colleen5991"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The product works great! I do know that I will be needing a longer HDMI cable to help get the at ck away from the tv. This will help with a connection issue I have. Also am needing to change my router to channel 8, as recommended . other then that, the stick has been everything that I hoped for. Except one day issue! It has a History App. Which requires you to already have a second subscription to the channel. Why can't Prime workout a deal with Time Warner for access?", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Morris Hardy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this thing, it is easy to use and very versatile.  I don't want to give the money grubbing cable company an almost criminal fee for 'activating' the already installed second wall outlet in my bedroom so I bought this.  I plugged it into the HDMI port and had almost instant access to all my streaming apps (Netflix, music, photos...).  I also side loaded a few apps and now have free cable and movies.  The Is simple and works great, the stick is easy to navigate and the quality is good; I would definitely recommend this.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Scott T.

This tiny device runs way faster than the $100+ Sony box that we got a year or two ago. The companion App also works great with this for navigation as well as typing or even voice searching.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Hung Sewell"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "LOVE IT!
