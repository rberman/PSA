That being said, I was able to compare the fire stick to them both.  I really like the menu setup and allowing prime movies to go the screen.  I haven't tried out the transparency function, but the idea is great.  IMO the menu and functionality favors more on the roku side than the apple tv.  However the price point on this device is great.  The only issue I had was during setup.  I had to input the wifi password several times before the device can connect and update.  Even after the update it asked me for the wifi password and in the middle of me typing it in, them menu popped up.  Perhaps an update will make it better.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "kc1911 \"CNP\""}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "It needs a lot of improvement.1) The biggest issue is \"HDCP unauthorised. Content disabled\" message. It worked fine for a month, then famous blue screen with this message showed up while trying playing Netflix or Amazon Prime movies. Too many people have this problem. You just need to Google the message.2) The other issue is using any other HDMI adapters like angles. It's 5 GHZ reception is so weak and sensitive. It stops working as soon as you use any HDMI adaptor!!! This machine reminds me the old days when I was trying to connect a simple mouse to a PC, but any other piece of PC was stopped working due to a lot of conflicts in COM ports!3) Be aware about your Google or YouTube purchased movies. You can see them in YouTube app, but when you try to play them, you'll get an error message.4) I was on waiting list for over 2 months while Bestbuy was selling that for $25. Amazon's famous unfaithful behavior to their loyal customers.Conclusions: It is faster than Chromecast, but it's less stable than that. It's better Amazon updates its software URGENTLY before start losing the market to Chromecast.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "amprg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Really simple connection to wireless and setup.

However, I have had a Roku 3 for 9 months now and I will continue using it as my main streaming device. The main feature that the Roku has that is missing from the Fire TV Stick is searching content from all apps in a single search. On Roku you can see what videos are available (and at what price) across Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, and many more services. On the Fire TV Stick you are limited to the Amazon ecosystem on the main screen and search. You have to go into apps individually to see what content is available. I have Amazon Prime but most of the videos I watch are on other services.The remote has a nice feel and is a little smaller than the Roku 3 remote. The power cable was long enough for my setup and the HDMI extension cable allowed me to plug the stick into the side HDMI port on my TV. My router is on the other side of the house and I haven't had any signal issues.I ordered this as a gift in case I ended up giving it to someone (I pre-ordered it) so it did not come tied to my Amazon account. I had to enter my Amazon password using the remote. I had to change my password to a simpler one and then back because I use generated passwords with LastPass and entering a long password on the remote is a tedious task. So if you order this as a gift for someone it will be a bit awkward to login initially. Other devices/apps display a one time code that you enter on your computer to register the device; this would be much better than the approach Amazon took.Overall, this is a very inexpensive streaming device that has nearly all of the features of any of the more expensive devices out there. You can't go wrong with the Fire TV Stick if you are looking for an inexpensive way to stream to your TV.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Robert H"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I am not overly thrilled with this as of yet. It's clunky and difficult to navigate when trying to search for channels. The apps I searched for before purchasing (TWC/AMC specifically) are not compatible with this device, which is a huge disappointment. It is definitely amazon-centric which was to be expected, but holy cow, trying to find anything else is a nightmare.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "nathansmom712"}]
