Once I swapped out the Amazon power supply with an iPad PS the sticks would boot. After that exercise I could successfully boot up the sticks with the original Amazon PS. Go figure!Once I got to the configuration menus the sticks would insist on updating their firmware. Nothing much would happen and after a while the download would time out and I would have to reenter the entire network configuration data. My 10 MBit/sec. Internet connection is fast enough to support HD streaming on my Amazon Fire TV box but too slow to download the sticks' firmware? I dunno...Returned to Amazon without any issues.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/2", "author": "walterj \"walterj\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Working as advertised", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Shane Barrows"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "The picture doesn't show that you have to have a power supply hooked up to the stick.  VERY disappointing.  The layout is bad when the menu comes up.  Roku is set up much better.  Bought this a couple of months ago for $19.  That is the only reason I'm keeping it.

It kept having problem with wifi even though it shows signal strength as good. My other computers right next to it have no issue with wifi. This is very annoying since it renders the device useless.Secondly, the user interface needs some improvement. It is not as intuitive as Apple TV I also own. The left side choices appear as confusing as it can get. What the heck is the difference among these TV, video, prime, etc.?Thirdly, the remote feels cheap. You know what I mean when you use Apple TV at the same time.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "H. W"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Set up was pretty easy.  Logging into Prime and Netflix-no problem.  I really like the interface on Netflix.  Unfortunately, I am unable to watch ANY programs.  They come up when I search but when I hit play, they just get stuck in the \"loading\" loop ad infinitum.  I had my old ROKU set up on another channel so I checked that it wasn't my Internet connection.  The first generation ROKU loads up netflix quickly.  The new firestick not only does not load up netflix content, but doesn't load up Amazon content either.  What a dud!!!  Also, I'm having trouble with the remote.  It seems to click ahead twice for every click and when you try to enter stuff on the keyboard with the remote, it will often enter two letters or skip a whole row of letters.  Another glitch is that the onscreen keyboard occasionally goes out of wack where the letters get scrambled and are no longer in the alphabetical order that is normal for a keyboard entry.  I will seek out the help desk but right now I would recommend people hold off until the bugs are worked out.Edit:  I figured out the problem. Truns out after having no problem initially connecting to my router, the firestick was having authentation issues.  After re-entering my password, still had authentication issues.  Went back to my ROKU and it was having a few issues but not nearly as bad.  I have an older TV and the HDMI inputs are in the back of the TV which was shielding the signal from the stick.  If you have a similar set up, I would avoid buying any of the stick devices and go with the set top type boxes.  My short-term solution is to angle my TV slightly so that there is a slight gap facing towards my router.  I might end up moving my router closer to the TV (or behind it)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Bill Neely"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This has an easy to use 'user' interface, and performs better than I expected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "azpeeps"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Incredible remote.

I am sure it's a decent product but Amazon like it's other corporate companions has put customer service at the bottom of the this of it priorities..
