We already had Amazon Prime and we signed up for Netflix and we don't miss cable at all and save over $100 a month. The fire stick is very easy to hook up and use. It is easy to flip through the apps and find shows. I wish we would have bought this when it first came out!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "StanleyJ"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've been looking high and low for a device that can get my spotify sounds to come out of my TV. FINALLY I found Amazon Fire TV stick. It's got all your standard apps plus Spotify Connect which is everything I ever hoped for. Also, I'm definitely feeling this little remote guy. I have Google Chromecast also and I'd say they are similar products but function a little differently. Chromecast operates from apps on your phone. Amazon Fire TV stick is completely self sufficient and doesn't require a phone to operate although essentially you can use both products to control apps on your TV. I like Amazon Fire TV stick a little bit better than Chromecast if I'm honest.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "OnlineAddict72"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "While it is nice to access Amazon Instant View Movies on TV via Amazon Fire Stick with a remote, the movies freeze often.
