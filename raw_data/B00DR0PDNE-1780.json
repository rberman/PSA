It's so easy to use. My friend keeps arguing that connecting his laptop is fine. But he didn't understand that there's a difference between using your phone, which you always have with you, vs using a computer that has to be plugged in.

With a few quick downloads for apps and chrome extensions I was streaming my web browser and my local files within minutes. Extremely easy to setup and use. Packaging was very solid and minimalist in appearance, as is expected of Google. The only momentary issue I ran into was the HDMI port itself was slightly less than perfectly machined a required a bit of force the first time i plugged it in, not enough to knock a star.
