It replaced a Roku in my daughters room. This has way more features. I love that she can pull up all of her Amazon music on this and play it through her tv. This may not be as beneficial if you don't have Amazon Prime. It is designed to enhance the Prime features and make them easily accessible on ones tv. I also love that it's small and doesn't take up any room. The Roku was an ugly lump on her dresser. Overall it was a great purchase. I may purchase a second for the tv in my room.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Melissa Newton"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Doesn't work", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/4", "author": "Mark Shea"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Beautiful work \u2661\u2661", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Nicole"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I have been enjoying this.
