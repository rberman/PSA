[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This works so fabulous. I now have wifi in my bedroom and can go in there and watch Netflix. I have a sony blue ray and wifi player in my living room and this is actually better. Fast loading and so far no loss of internet like in the other room.

Or you can broadcast Netflix and other applications, Ive only used Netflix so far, and it works great, and its in HD.Make sure on your wireless setup that you have \"wireless isolation\" turned off. That will block the communication between your Chromecast and Laptop. I knew to check my router for this because I work in IT. This was not mentioned in the setup when I ran into issues.

It does get really hot if your watching for long periods of time. I unplug the USB connection when I'm not using it. When you re-connect be sure to wait for the indicators to signal connect complete. Otherwise, I'm really enjoying watching on the big screen.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Paulette"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Just received it today.

Setup was easy. I connected it to an HDMI port on the TV. The TV was not on when connected, but since the TV supports HDMI CEC the TV turned itself on and set the correct HDMI port. Very cool. Setup was easy. I loaded Chromcast on my Android phone and configured the device for my wireless network. After it did an update to the latest software version I was ready to go. I've tested with HBO GO, Netflix, Youtube, and casting from a Chrome browser tab. All worked great with no problems. This fits exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jim Dean"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The only thing that bothers me, is that there is not enough chromecast compatible apps yet.
