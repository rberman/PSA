Coming from a Chromecast it sure is nice having a remote and not having to stream from my phone. It has plenty of good apps that most people are already familiar with. The interface is fantastic and a lot nicer looking than Roku.I do have a few complaints though. It disconnects from the Internet quite often and requires unplugging the power from the Stick to reconnect. Not a huge deal but can be VERY annoying when it happens multiple times per movie. Never had the problem with Chromecast. The remote is sometimes unresponsive and again could require an unplugging. Sometimes though it randomly starts working again without having to do so.All in all I would give this 3.5 stars if I could. I will say I am glad I paid only $20 for this during the promotion otherwise I would probably purchase a Roku if I had to do it over. I bought my parents one a couple years back and they've had no issues with it. At $40 this would be a 2 star for me, however.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It works great!

The stick is an awesome value. I was a bit skeptical that such a small, inexpensive device could deliver such a good user experience. Love the Amazon prime instant video, the Netflix app, and Sling TV. Can't wait for the HBO Go app. Highly recommend to other cord cutters.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Andrew R."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing! So easy and simple to use.
