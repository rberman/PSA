We sent the apple tv back almost immediately and bought another Fire tv for our bedroom.  We love it!  FIrst of all it comes pre-registered so it doesn't take you 20 minutes to get your email log in and password entered.  If you have amazon prime it makes much more sense to get the fire TV so you can take advantage of your prime content, also we found that purchasing tv episodes and renting movies is $1 to $2 cheaper per purchase on Amazon than on I tunes.  The voice command feature works GREAT!  So much easier than searching for shows or going back to replay.  Sometimes it does not take you to the free content and it takes you to the paid content first even though it's free on Hulu, but it only happens occasionally and isn't a big deal.  If you want to cut the cord and stream fire tv is the way to go!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Anastasia"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I like my Amazon Fire TV, but for some reason if I use the Voice Search feature and the result is not available in Amazon, and I select \"More ways to Watch\", I get options for Hulu Plus (when applicable), but not for Netflix (even when the title is available there).  This is a major reason I bought this product is to have voice search access to movies and tv shows from multiple sources.  I have searched and searched for an answer, but cannot find any solution on the website nor any phone number to call nor any email address to write.  This was my only alternative to try to get an answer.  Otherwise, I very much like the Fire TV.  I got it for my parents to also use because they are somewhat technologically challenged and typing in search term using the remote can be very difficult.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/3", "author": "alohameansgoodbye \"baseball fan\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I was using a Wii to stream Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, etc., for my mom's TV and was unable to watch Amazon for more than one movie and YouTube got hung up frequently as did Netflix (too little memory in the Wii).I got the Fire TV unit and it was super-simple to hook up, easy to navigate and no more hang-ups, even using wi-fi with an extension. It will play 2 or 3 episodes of a program on Netflix without prompting (whereas the Wii needed input after each episode) and there is a really nice screensaver that takes over when nothing is showing. There are more apps available, too, the best of which (for us) is Pandora radio.I'm glad I got this, it was money well spent for the purpose it was purchased.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "ani-mc"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "as advertised. voice recognition super ! most amazon prime shows not free - tv shows in last year for example.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Mrs. Gay L.

Runs great especially if you have prime. The only downside is that if you purchase and download a large game such as Dead trigger or Modern Combat then you run out of your storage space with those two games alone. So I wish it had an additional storage slot for an SD card. It does have a USB port so I don't know if that can be used for storage yet or not but I will update it when I find out.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "6/6", "author": "Buffdeer"}]
