I love the menus and how interactive the user interface is, but after using it for a few weeks it does this silly thing when starting programs on Hulu and Netflix where just after starting the program, it stops and pauses itself.  Not a total killer, but it is a bit tedious having to hit the play button a second time.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Footie Sasquatch \"Kevin\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So fast!

It also connects with my son's kindle so if he is watching a movie and we get home it transfers to the TV. You do have to pay for the different apps like Hulu and Netflix.
