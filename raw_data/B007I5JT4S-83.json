Simple set up, very efficient at streaming, so far it's preferable to my PS3 in that area. Also can sync with your iTunes and Mac computer.Only problem I had is actually with Hulu, when you're watching a show (as in multiple episodes), at the end of an episode it doesn't automatically start playing the next episode. Which I'm sure is something to do with Hulus programming and not to do with the AppleTV.Fantastic product, absutely worth the price.
