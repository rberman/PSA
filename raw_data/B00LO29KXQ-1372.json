It's inexpensive, works well in hotels (huge plus because I travel) and has as many channels as the other companies in this racket.  What I don't like is it pushes Amazon content hard...meaning movies, shows, etc that you like on other apps (like Netflix or HBO GO) don't readily appear on the home screen.  You have to go into the relevant app to view that content; but anything Amazon related is easy displayed.This is not a showstopper for me, so I only knocked the Fire Stick down 1 star for the hassle.  That said it works as advertised and I'm thrilled to be done with my $200+ Comcast bill.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JP"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "ok", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Larry Everett"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I found the firestick to be a mixed bag.  First off, some misleading marketing.  You look at the picture, and you think that all you do is plug it in.  In fact, \"for best performance\" you need to connect it to a wall power outlet.  That isn't a deal breaker, but if you need to plug it into the wall, then market it as such.  The second issue that I had with it was its size.  It's fat and doesn't play well  with other hdmi outlets.  Since you have to connect to a power outlet anyway, it would be better to design it more like a cable that is flexible and can easily connect to any connection.  Third item is networking connectivity.  It works great when it has a good wireless connection.  When you are at the outer range of your wireless router, I find that Netflix does a much better job of handling the poor connection.  Fourth, its login process gives unhelpful error messages.  I am having connection issues, and it tells me that I have an invalid password.  If the connection is bad, then it should say the connection is bad - it shouldn't route all error situations to a single, misleading error message.On the positive side, once I moved it to a TV with a better connection, it performed flawlessly.  It is much more enjoyable to watch Amazon Instant Video using this device, than trying to hook up my laptop.  My wife and I binge watched a season of the Bachelorette and it was just as good as watching a series on Netflix - better since the device is always on, and you don't have to log into it.  Just turn the TV on, switch to the correct HCMI port, and immediately pick your show on Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tod Frye"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We were tired of our Cable bill and gave this a try.
