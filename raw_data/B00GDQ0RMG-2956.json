I bought the Fire TV stick for a second tv that I normally watch. Both products are very easy to install and operation of apps is smooth My wife watches the series type shows from some app & I watch mostly movies so the Amazon Prime network app isgreat for me. Zero commercials-WooHoo!!  The equiptment is made very nicely also. Some TV remotes look sloppy even before the food & all becomes part of them. The Amazon products exude quality when removed from the packaging as well as when operating them. Thanks Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Larry"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I went back to Netflix.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Florencio Mendiola Jr."}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Was working great.
