[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I've been an owner from \"day 1\", starting with one device, then I was so impressed I purchased 3 more from Amazon and Bestbuy before supplies became limited. Inside the space of approximately 2 weeks I had all 4 units plugged into my flat screens around the house. In my Theatre Room I have one plugged into one of the HDMI ports on my receiver which is connected to a projector. The result is an awesome 120\" Chromecast 1080p, high def video that is stunning, audio is managed by the receiver so I get Surround Sound, the programming is generated from my iPad, iPhone, or Mac laptop while I can still surf the net or answer email if I choose to.  Great product and soooooo inexpensive!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "The Rev \"Gadgeteer\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "i really haven't spent enough time setting up the chromecast hence it seems to work erratically.

I use it to cast the Google Drive Presentation slide show from the Chrome browser to a welcome display.  Works awesome for our welcome display which is a 60\" monitor.  No HDMI adapter, long cables,  VGA adapters, extender boxes, just the little Chromecast device.  I even Chromecast from my Linux Chromium browser.  I was amazed it worked from Linux.  I believe the Linux browser cannot do the initial set-up, but once the Chromecast device was set-up with the Android phone, Linux was able to cast from the Chromium browser using the Chromecast extension.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M.
