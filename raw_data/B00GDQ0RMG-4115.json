[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "I really love the fire TV stick for streaming.  We don't watch a lot of tv, but this is a very convenient way for us to stream the movies we own.  I also use the Prime yoga videos quite a lot, and the kids have really enjoyed watching some of the Prime kids' shows.  A couple of times there's been a little skipping, very infrequently, but I assume that is a connection issue and not due to the processing power in the stick.  I keep losing the remote (by \"I\" I mean, everyone else in my family), but I set up the app on my phone and that works fine too.  I'm very happy with everything I've done with the tv stick.  I particularly like that it doesn't take any time to boot up or whatnot ... I used to not want to stream on our tv because it takes so long for the Wii or whatever else we were using to stream to start up, etc.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Sarah Carpenter"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Trudye A.

Just one more gadget.  I was not impressed,, then then I installed it,, it automatically signed me up and charged me 99.00 for amazon prime, which I already had,, and I had to spend an hour on the phone getting that credited back(which then did fine,, but it was just the bother of it all)  It had been installed for 2 weeks, and I have only tried it the first day, and not once since,,", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
