I am seriously pissed about it...our wifi connection is strong..but still it keeps getting disconnected..and asks us to rescan and forever searches for the network. I keep thinking if I could have avoided this issue if I purchased the Fire Tv for $70 more .... I hope the Amazon guys can rectify it somehow", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Rajashree"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "It is a good product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Abdul Beydoun"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "I'd probably give this thing closer to 4.5 stars if that were an option, but overall I'm pretty impressed with this device. It's fast, simple, and easy-to-use. Out of all the other small, HDMI, streaming devices out there, this one truly seems like the biggest bang for the buck. I'm particularly impressed with how fast it streams content in comparison to other devices in already in my house, especially with the HDMI extender connected.The free Fire TV phone app is pretty good, too. My one gripe with it is that while the voice control works great, navigating menus by touching the phone screen can be a little inaccurate, but it's not a major problem. Definitely recommended.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Bennettovnikolai"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Netflix performance on this is jittery even with the usb power plugged in.

I have the tablet, phone, and 3 Kindles.  It is so nice to have everything uniform.  I hesitated to get the Fire Stick as I have a Roku but wanted to mirror my tablet the screen.  I am pleased with that aspect of the the stick but the best part is that you can take it with you on trips, etc.  I just recently bought the manual on a lightning deal and now I have the apps, channels, etc.  I am happy with the diversity and choices.

For users who have not discovered that you don't have to reinsert the fire stick each time to use it - When you've finished viewing, select the \"sleep\" setting in your menu options.
