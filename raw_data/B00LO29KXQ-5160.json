[{"rating": 1.0, "review": "It took three fire sticks before the installation could be completed. Twice, after about two hours, Amazon decided the first two fire sticks evidently were defective. Then there was difficulty trying to get a replacement, all because there was some dispute about which credit card I had used.  I had great difficulty understanding the lady trying to help me, and finally I had to request to speak with a supervisor.  I had ordered a total of four fire sticks, and all of them were about to be returned so great was my frustration level. I'm not sure how to access more than the 71 movies that appear on the home screen or even how to access multiple seasons of TV show.  I'm sure there is a lot more to the fire stick, but I just don't know how to use it to its full advantage.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Cheryl Mahaffey"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "We liked it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "JeannieD"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Norbert"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works perfectly 2 minute setup and I was watching Netflix then listened to my music", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Alex O."}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "This requires a power source, it does not show on any of the advertisements that it has a plug from the stick to a power outlet.
