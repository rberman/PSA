It is a great product, which anyone could expect from Amazon. Great build quality, easy setup and syncing for screen mirroring with other devices (such as my HDX 7\") and beautiful display with almost no lag time what so ever. And at a superb price point. If you are a prime member, I highly recommend this. If you're not a prime member, I recommend you  become one and then buy this. I have 2 newer model Roku boxes and I prefer the Fire TV Stick over either of  them. I've seen some of the reviews say that it's too \"Amazon centric\" but honestly, I disagree. I think Amazon has out done themselves yet again with this amazing streaming device. I am looking into upgrading to the full Amazon fire TV box and game controllers. Admittedly, I am an Amazon devotee in the fact that I own 3 Kindles ( 3G, original Fire and Fire HDX 7\" 2013) as well as the Amazon Echo, Alexa ( which is another product I highly recommend! She is great and my family loves her) and am hoping to convert to the Fire phone soon too! Anyway, if you are a prime member who loves Amazon, loves movies and TV shows, music, and wants to see your cloud photos on your big screen then buy the Fire TV Stick.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joseph McBride"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "No. It doesn't work and I'm still waiting for Amazon to find a solution.

We purchased the stick to watch streaming services on our non-internet connected TV, so we were expecting a seamless streaming device...as promised by Amazon.  Since December, the device has stopped working twice (once I can't explain, the other quite possibly was because the AmazonBasics batteries died 2 weeks after installation), has repeatedly reset my log-in information, and freezes between 5-15 times per program while watching Hulu or Netflix.  I've followed the troubleshooting guide laid out by Amazon and nothing seems to make the device function any better.  Before you assume that the problem is with my internet, I have connected my AppleTV, Chromecast, and XboxOne to the TV in the exact same spot in my living room, and all three of those streaming devices performed well without any interruptions.  I'm hoping that there will be a firmware update soon that will solve these problems, but until then, I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of this product that has been highly touted by Amazon.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Keith"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love it, watch several good prime movies", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Janice"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "Requires repeated resetting to keep internet connection.

We had to get a new router cause old one was screwing up so we got Netgear 900 router which turned out to be fine, but even the dual band wasn't strong enough to get a good signal to our end of house.  So that meant a WiFi extender, again Netgear 1200.  With that set up the signal was just fine and we were in busiess!!The fire stick is an excellent product!  Easy to use and understand and fun if your signal is strong, but it sucks if it is always buffering or telling you to watch at a later time.  But with enough signal everything is smooth!  About the only complaint is that one has to wait, sometimes a long time, before it is free with prime!  Otherwise, lots of viewing!  Rate it at five cause I like up and coming new directors and there are a lot of them!!!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}]
