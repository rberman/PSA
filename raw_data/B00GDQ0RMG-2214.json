Couldn't afford a smart TV and now we have one. Easy set up we just need to reconfigure our surround sound. The price is right and you can use your phone as a second remote. It's awesome and there are more choices than over priced cable where you have things you never use. Highly recommended you won't be sorry.

I especially like the ability to easily back it up 10 seconds to review what a character just said. It also makes good suggestions based on what you have already viewed. Cuts out the commercials and allows one episode to play right after the previous one.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "M. Wright \"Sophe\""}]
