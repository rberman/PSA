Both sticks work beautifully.  Vizio TVs aren't bad either.I bought the Fire Sticks because I like British TV (Amazon has great shows) and Amazon didn't have caption capability with the product I was using.  The Fire Stick allows me to have closed captions for most of the Amazon TV shows and movies.I highly recommend this product", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Joellen BalfourFry"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Very convenient and versatile!
