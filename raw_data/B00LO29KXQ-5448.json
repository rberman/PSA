There are two points where I feel improvement could be made. First, the Amazon menu system starts with selecting a category (select Movies, Apps (then Netflix, Showtime Anywhere, etc.), music and then selecting the items within that category.  This system makes finding individual items difficult if one does not use the search function.The bigger issue is the data usage by streaming video. If you have a fast internet speed (like faster than 100 MBPS), the stream is high quality but uses a lot of bandwidth. If one has a data cap, there might be problems. I did not see a simple way in the settings to lower the bandwidth used.On the other hand, the streaming of Amazon prime music with lyrics is better than I expected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Bigger Jake"}]
