I'll bullet point my feelings belowPros- hides behind the tv, using the USB as a power source- has netflix/hulu/pandoraCons- i have fast cable internet, and excellent wifi; however, the home screen takes forever to load- i have to regularly log in to netflix. while this isn't terrible, it's time consuming and annoying with the remote- the apps are very lacking. i want hockey streams and several other offerings that this device simply doesnt have..i mean, they seriously just added HBO GO- i frequently have to restart the device because it stops reading the remte control commands- scrolling through the home menu is laggy and choppy at times- amazon prime offers nothing really that netflix and hulu arent already offering.all in all, it works. If you just want netflix and the basic streaming services on a tv, then go for it. i got it because i really like amazon, the price is on point, and it boosts some good tech stats compared to competitors...but once you get over the \"oh yay, i have a streaming stick!\" phase, you enter the \"ok, what about all the cool stuff out there other than netflix?\" stage...and it gets boring", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jp"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "The two stars are specifically for the excellent Amazon customer service I received.  I was very excited to receive this fire stick but sadly was unable to install it on my TV.  Things were moving along fine - remote ready, fire stick ready - installation program comes up on my TV screen and asks me to hit play to move on.  What appears is a grey screen simply saying \"connect to the internet\" but gives me no options to do so.  Can't go forward, can't go back.  So after a lengthy chat with Amazon customer service and all the turning on and turning off and unplugging and resetting (we all know THAT drill) it was concluded my fire stick was defective and was returned and replaced. The second fire stick produced the same results, so I had to return it.  Either Amazon was incorrect in their assumption that the device was faulty and there was in fact a problem on my end, or the quality of these is very poor.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Peggy"}]
