There is a maximum distance restriction of around 20 feet from your internet router with Google Chromecast:-((. I received my Fire TV Stick yesterday. It took only minutes to install. It also works great with dual band routers, which Chromecast will not. I am happy to report that I can now watch Netflix on my living room TV with the smoothest streaming video ever! The remote is a big plus, too. This device is a keeper!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Anonymous"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "This has been a great money saver.
