[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Firstly, I am comparing this to the Amazon Fire TV box. Right off the bat the remote control does not have voice search features. It doesn't even have a microphone built into it. I think you have to pay around $30 extra for that. In that case you might as well get the Amazon Fire TV box. But I knew about this before I ordered it. In fact I am one of the people who bought two of them for half off during its early release. Other then that, the remote works as intended but feels much more like cheap plastic compared to its microphone version remote which looks, grips and feels better.Secondly, I can tell immediately that the Fire Stick is much slower to respond to remote button clicks then the Fire TV is. I assume because the Fire Stick has a lesser processor which is the Broadcom Capri 28155 dual-core 2xARM A9 with 1GB ram VS Amazon Fire TV which has a nice Qualcomm Krait 300 quad-core 1.7Ghz processor with 2GB ram. If you have no idea what that means, it means the Amazon Fire TV Box is much faster then the stick. However video playback on the stick doesn't seem to be bothered by the lesser processor. I do notice that if I leave the stick for several days and come back to it, its very slow starting up but after a couple minutes it starts moving fast again or is just reboots automatically because it just crashes. I believe it may be forced into an interactive governor but I haven't checked. Google Android Interactive Governor if you want to learn more about what that is.Thirdly, I had a hard time getting the Fire Stick to work with adobe digital surround sound with my receiver. When I would play any Amazon movie, the sound wouldn't come through. However, playing a video through Hulu Plus or Netflix worked fine. So I tried out my Fire Box on the same receiver and it worked fine. I got in touch with Amazon tech support and talked to a leader, which has something to do with their position with support. Her name was Jasmine. A very helpful leader. I would suggest asking for her. After a couple weeks of her calling me to check in and waiting to hear back from the back end developers, they knew of the problem and eventually down the road it would be fixed. For some reason, in the Fire Stick settings when adobe digital surround sound is selected and used in conjunction with certain receivers the sound from the Amazon library don't produce sound but Netflix and Hulu Plus work fine. I was told it would be fixed in a possible distant firmware or software upgrade. For the time being, I have to switch to the 2.1 sound setting which means I cannot enjoy my 5.1 sound system in my theatre room. I could always hook up the Amazon TV box but I got it perfectly situated in my other TV room.Lastly, there is no USB port on the stick. So for those who are rooting and taking advantage of the USB port or for those who just want to use it for a keyboard or mouse on the Amazon Fire TV, can't happen on the stick.And one more thing to add. The app that allows you to use your phone for navigating the Fire Stick and to use voice search is extremely hit and miss. You talk into your phone and it may or may not type out the words you said on the screen and if it does its 5 seconds later. The TV Stick is new and I am sure people will submit enough feedback to get these problems resolved.Honestly, I would spend the extra money and get the Amazon Fire TV box. You pay a bit more but you get a more superior product. And if you root the box and take advantage of the USB port the possibilities are endless.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Jay"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "The Good:* A great selection of media and apps, very easy to set up and use, the included remote works well.The Bad:* The Plex client isn't the greatest.  It occasionally loses connection with the server and there are a lot more anomalies and artifacts on HD video than I get using Plex on a Roku 2 from the same source.* There is almost too much emphasis on sourcing video from Amazon over any other source, though I suppose that's to be expected.* Movie Rentals are grossly overpriced, but that's not Amazon's fault.* The FireTV Stick requires more power than my TV's USB port would deliver, requiring me to use the included wall wart instead.The Ugly:* The Miracast implementation is horribly broken (no surprise being that its based on Android where Miracast is also horribly broken).  I am not sure Amazon has much interest in fixing it as it is working enough to work OK with other Fire devices.  But it will not allow for sharing a Windows display or many non-amazon phone screens, or many non-amazon tablets.  Miracast is a standard and it should be supported as such and work universally.  Breaking it for competitors devices or just not fixing it is unacceptable.  Hopefully a FireTV update is forthcoming to address this issue.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jared Nelson"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great!

I ordered this with skepticism. Figuring out how to work electronic devices is not my thing. In ONE day I declared myself at expert at navigating the Fire TV Stick AND I downloaded the app on my Galaxy S3 (I know, old phone) and have used that as well to navigate my Fire TV Stick. I have an older 36\" Symphonic TV and was using a Wii to use Netflix. THIS. IS. SO. MUCH. BETTER! It is ONLY $39. Actually I like it better than using our actual 'smart' TV that is not so easy to navigate. I should mention I am a prime member so when I plugged this in to the TV all my saved shows and cloud pics are already on there. I use Netflix and it was already on there and I just had to sign in just like I would on any other device. NOW, I do have to unplug the stick and plug in our DirectTV Genie to watch satellite because I just have the one plug in thing but not a big deal for me. IF you wanted to have both plugged in you would have to buy an extra gadget. Yeah, I don't know the names for all those things but you know what I mean.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Denise"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this so much better then the one from the fruit company.
