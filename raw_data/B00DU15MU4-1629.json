Streams videos well with very little buffering. However, If amazon wants to compete in the casual/hardcore gaming space they either need to up the storage space or allow additional storage media through USB to install data onto. Even though the unit has a 8GB drive to store your apps on, only 5GB is available. Some games can take up 2-3gb of Data. Which uses the available 5GB of storage very quickly. Meaning you can only put one or 2 games on the device at a time with little space for anything else. Loss of 2 stars because of this. It is very important to not only have powerful hardware but to also have or allow for additional storage.", "verified": false, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Komix2k"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Product works great. Lightning fast, apps open instantly. Has a nice range and is compatible with 5ghz wireless. Remote is awesome, voice search works perfectly.The main issue is content...not a lot of quality games so dont buy this thinking  youre getting a gaming system; youre not.
