I had to go into the TV sets programing and set up the HDMI port to recognize  Fire Stick. After that the programing went fairly well.I did have to input my wireless modem password. I've only watched one movie so far with no issues. I've been checking out all the programming available  and adding some to my watch list. Looks like a good amount to choose from.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer \"Skip\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Better than the Roku stick. Not better than the Roku 3. But that's not a fair fight. I like the chromecast... However having a dedicated remote is nice. So in the end, for a cheapish media player/bridge...
