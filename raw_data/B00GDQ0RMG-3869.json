I factory reset the stick, changed routers, all the basics. Nothing. This is an issue as my chromecast and bluray both don't have connectivity issues, and this hampers my migration away from Google (nexus7 to fireHD, galaxyS3 to fire phone), meaning I still have to juggle devices.

In an earlier review, I complained that the content repeatedly needed buffering, and I got a message on screen telling me my Wifi connection is too slow. I have since been able to make this work with no issues by ensuring I have all other wifi devices (computers, phone, etc) turned off. (The other choice obviously would be to order a more powerful connection from my broadband provider. Either way, the experience has been excellent.) I have watched a dozen or so movies in the comfort of my home using the Fire Stick.
