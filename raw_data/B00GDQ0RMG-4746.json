[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "This is a terrific piece of technology.  I bought it primarily because it included the Slingbox app.  That enables me to watch cable TV when I'm out in the country at my cabin (yes, I have internet).  But the prime movies, the prime TV, the other apps and the remote control make it a very easy and convenient tool.  I can even mirror my phone or tablet on the TV using the Fire TV Stick.I would definitely buy this again.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Amazon Customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "So easy to use.

I like it - it's responsive. I also use a Roku Stick on the same TV almost everyday.  My Fire TV Stick loads from a cold start faster and loads screens faster than Roku Stick. Yet, I don't like the Fire interface as much as Roku interface. Fire is too busy, too cluttered. Press on a Fire selection (channel) and it jumps up, quadruples in size.  I prefer less in your face.For sure, I don't like the Fire remote as much as the Roku remote.  It's too small and flimsy.  I prefer a more solid, larger remote, with standard buttons.Fire TV Stick cannot stream my movies and TV shows from my 2 servers.  Admittedly, with Plex it can stream movies and TV shows stored on my home computer, but not from my servers, even the DLNA equipped server.  Roku can stream most saved movies residing on my DLNA server using its own Roku Media channel, no additional help needed.  Fire does not have a comparable channel selection, that I have found.If I didn't need the TV Stick for streaming from my home servers, I'd give it 4 or 5 stars because \"she is snappy.\"", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Blueflippy \"blueflippy\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "WISH I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THE LIMIT AT THAT PRICE!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "MONICA"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to install.
