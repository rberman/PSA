Simply stated, I thought it was junk.  Skippy video and audio.Then, I tried it using a tablet (Google Nexus).  The darn thing works great when I use the tablet.  Both the desktop and tablet were in the same room and distance from the TV.My conclusion...  I decided Windows 8 pretty much stinks a long time ago and it doesn't surprise me that it makes this thing not work well either.  With the tablet, it's sweet.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jeepers"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I'm just waiting for more worldwide apps, not just for USA, but with the current apps I can cast my music/photo/video library into the Tv.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Otto Gamboa"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love this product, everything I expected and more.

It took me several tries to get it working correctly. I have a router extender, and it doesn't work well with one. I finally got it to work with my original router, but I think there will be delays in the projection because of the distance to my router. Anyway, the app works well. I am not sure if the Chromcast has as much content available. I haven't used it a lot, so I can't say for sure.
