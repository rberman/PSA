I personally find Amazon.com to be a reliable company proving it's longevity and titan like business ethic which comforts me in building a cloud library of movies thru amazon with no regrets. So far I like it's size, and setup is a snap.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Raul Jig"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Arrived early, well boxed, installed easily, works well.

The remote is quite good for watching prime content. I havent used it on Netflix or other apps yet. The only trouble is when you have to type in passwords or look for titles you have to use the stick to navigate. I have alternatively used the android app remote for this TV stick and that works quite well (the apps has other changes that are required). But overall a good product if you have a lot of prime content that you would like to watch.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Siddarth Chandrasekaran"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Tiffany Owen"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Obviously,  I am loving this product. It works exactly as described and the features are amazing.  It beats my Roku device hands down, no question a much superior product.  The Roku, I have keeps dropping the wifi signal and is very annoying.  This Amazon Fire TV Stick has not dropped the wifi signal once.I only have two minor issues which is why I dropped one star.1. The device is a bit hard to plug in to my HDMI spot on the back on the TV. I had to use the \"Extender\" that came with it.  But once plugged in it was very simple to set up and it works like a dream. Unfortunately I have to unplug it nearly everyday. which leads me to point ...2. The device interferes with my HD Antenna signal.  I have to unplug the Fire Stick to get signal from the HD Antenna and watch the local HD broadcasts. It is a minor inconvenience but one that I did not anticipate.Even with these inconveniences I still think this is the next best thing since sliced bread.  Once I upgrade my other TV to a HD TV I will definitely be getting another Fire Stick and throw out the Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Carrie"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "I expected more out of this device. First, it wasn't compatible (???) with the HDMI ports on my receiver. It would not boot up no matter what I did. Just got stuck on the Amazon logo. Once I connected it directly to my TV it booted up fine. No big deal. However, I purchased this primarily for the plex functionality, and after paying for the app on Amazon (which I already own on other platforms as well as plex pass lifetime) I found out it doesn't support 5.1 audio. Hopefully Amazon can fix this in the future and I can improve my review. It would also be great if Amazon could include an option to boot directly to an app. Google TV's aging platform supported this and it was great for plex usage.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "SwinginFriar \"swinginfriar\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love the new fire stick and the unlimited movies", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Roschanda"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Have a computer monitor.
