If that's too hard to visualize, the chromecast and router are separated by about 10ft through one wall and through the TV itself.I'm using an older Dell XPS 15 L502X (i5 2410M) and when I can get a decent signal, it works great. On the idle screen the reception would mostly stay at one bar and would occasionally go up to two wifi bars.I tried tab streaming South Park from the official site using the computer (by casting a tab with the chrome extension) and the video quality was there, but it would drop the connection after about 5 minutes. I need to revisit my router settings (I'm using a Belkin N300 with TomatoUSB, on only G with N disabled) since I might be on 40MHz which may be causing the bad reception. Other devices in the house can get reliable reception up to about ~30 feet, and this is through multiple walls so I know it's something to do with the device itself (or an incompatible router setting).Setup was very easy through the iOS app, no complaints there. I had the option to set it up through the computer but my phone was more convenient. I briefly tried the Netflix app to stream from my iPhone but it just got stuck on the spinner icon.Only other thing I can say is that maybe the HDMI extender should be a little longer so it can possibly clear the TV, though I'm not sure that would do much for the reception anyway.The USB Cable is an OK length (not sure exactly how long) and it works for me because there is an Xbox 360 nearby for its USB ports. I could see how this can be a problem for other users without a USB port on their TV and they'd probably need an extension cord with the AC adapter.Great value here, but I'm hoping for an update to fix the wifi issues sometime soon. Will update my review later on if they do decide to update or if I'm able to fix the problem myself.UPDATE: I changed my router from Auto G/N (I previosuly thought it was on G only) switching to just G and at the same time set the bandwidth from 40MHz to 20MHz and now the device gets a full signal. The 40MHz setting was probably at fault but I thought I remembered reading it doesn't work too well with N anyway. I've bumped up the stars from 3 to 4, but not 5 because of some weird issues I've been getting (but it's in Beta after all). I played a youtube video in Chrome on my PC and used the Chromecast button inside the youtube player (instead of the extension button next to the address bar) and the video got stuck looping on my TV. I would try to play a different video and the new title would display but would eventually switch back to the looping video after a few seconds. Removing the power cord didn't fix it. I can't remember my exact steps but I ended up using my iPad mini to take over the Chromecast and play something else.I'm also surprised to see that my mid 2009 MacBook Pro can only handle 480p video tab streaming and still sometimes stutters for a fraction of a second whereas my 2010 Dell XPS-15 dual core i5 (base model) can stream everything fine.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Leonard R.

The main concern was that the product information I could find indicated that it would only play video files off of the cloud or through services such as NetFlix.  My main reason for ordering this product was so that I could stream locally hosted video files off of my computer and onto my tv without using cables.  Luckily, after doing a quick online search, I learned that it will play video files stored on your computer in several different formats.
