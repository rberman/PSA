I was pleased with a Roku 3 connected to my main television, so purchased the 3500R streaming stick for a second bedroom.  Installation took but a few minutes, and streaming was just as easy to set up as the first.  Also, I noticed no lag time connecting to Netflix, etc., as others may have experienced.  Would highly recommend!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Minnesotan"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Discrete and  easy to install.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "happy customer"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I love this stick. It brings Netflix and Amazon Instant to my tv with no glitches, no hours-long setup at all. Easy peasy. I also like how there's so many other channels to try out as well. With the Fox News channel, I can choose which news stories I want to watch without commercials. There are also local news channels for many different cities as well.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "abby lane"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Excellent", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eddie Smith \"Writing Coach\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Had for 2 weeks. Setup was very easy. Connection from Roku app to it on Ipad and Ipods worked slick (well). ** BE CAREFUL, there are a bunch of apps on the Apple app store that say they are the Roku app. Make sure you get the one from \"Roku, inc\". Or go to the Roku web site and click on the link to the app store from there. It will bring up the correct app. That's what I did.Interface response time is good, may be better with full Roku device, but not annoying and certainly better than with my BluRay player. No problems with logging in to streaming apps or music (netflix, amazon, spotify, pandora). Love it so far.PS. I connected it to my receiver in the back which is enclosed with a glass door with metal grating on it in the front. No issues with picking up wireless or connection from remote. I connected it with a \"Cable Matters 270 Degree HDMI Male to Female Adapter\" so it sticks out a little. Don't know if that helps or not. But works great as is.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "hpfans2"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it!

On a stick!  Forget Chromecast.  Get this.  Seriously.  Just stop reading the reviews, and hit the Buy button.
