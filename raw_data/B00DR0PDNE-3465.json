I ordered from Amazon USA and the product was delivered on time.I attached the Chromecast with my regular 37\" LED TV and it instantly became more feature enriched than a SMART TV. I casted netflix, youtube to my TV from my cell phone, laptop & tablet. Voila it was quick and crystal clear.Even I casted movies from so many other web sites also, the only condition is always use CHROME web browser. Now, I am a die hard fan of Google Chromecast.I will recommend this product to everyone. Instead of buying SMART TV, just attach this magical device to any regular TV (with HDMI connection) and your TV will out perform the expensive SMART TV.

Buyers should understand that if all they want is to stream YouTube or Netflix from their iPad to their TV, this thing is great.  It's inexpensive, easy to set up and it works just fine.  The problem is, that's all it does.  It streams media from YouTube, Netflix, and music and video from Google Play.  You can also pop up web pages from your PC, but not from your Android or iOS device.  What you can't do is stream video through Chrome, which seems odd.Something really promising about this device is that it lets you use your smart phone or tablet as your remote.  That's an amazing feature and it works really well; almost flawlessly.  Some of the negative reviews complained about that, but it's a really cool feature and other devices could take a page from Google's book on this kind of integration.  If this thing supported just one more app, I'd be tempted to give it 4 or even 5 stars, but with it's current limitations I just can't do it.Google promises that more apps are coming, but which ones?  If this device supported the TWC app or HBOGo, I might have kept it. If it could stream music or video from Windows Media Player, I might have kept it.  The bottom line is, what I really want is a Roku box and what I should have done was shelled out the extra coin to get what I was looking for rather than hoping for a less expensive solution.Don't get me wrong, one day this little gizmo is going to give Roku a run for their money.
