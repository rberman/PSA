I prefer my Chromecast.  The First TV Stick is too sensitive you click on the selection button and it advances not to the next selection but way past it.  Also I like to be able to use my microphone on my phone and do searches for shows on my various apps, on Fire TV Stick you have to use their time consuming alpha selection letter by letter...blah.  The only reason I got the Fire TV Stick was to get my Amazon Prime Instant Video to play on my TV in the living room. It also crashes every once in a while if you watch a few movies.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lisa F \"Lisa\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great entertainment!
