Remember that this product is only a few months old and that new app functionality for Hulu+, Plex, etc have just recently been added and most Developers work quickly to fix major bugs.A few weeks ago, many new apps were added. SO DON'T LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS SAYING IT ONLY HAS YOUTUBE & NETFLIX. The list of supported apps is here: [...]With that in mind, I find it to work really well, particularly with Plex & Hulu. Very smooth as long as your internet connection is strong and of decent speed, as with any streaming device. Using it on my iPad & iPhone as well as Chrome browser is easy. Set up was easy. Casting is easy. Click the cast button and there it is. In addition, it's a really great tool for work. Presentations can be cast directly from Chrome. I just drag the .pdf into Chrome and cast. Fantastic.The small size makes this a MUCH better option for traveling vs my Roku or ATV.

So suck it, Comcast!Generally speaking, Chromecast doesn't do anything that my Roku or Blu-ray player (which streams) can do. Picture quality is as good, but no better. If plugged into an A/V receiver it will stream surround sound audio. While a flood of new apps were recently added, it still doesn't support Amazon Prime or MLB.tv.And despite being pretty cheap, the Roku base model isn't much more expensive and offers far more content.Casting from Chrome browser tabs is pretty poor. Not only are most video formats not supported, but even for surfing the web there's a pretty big lag time between what you see on your computer screen and TV.I imagine that Google will eventually provide casting capability to all of its computer, smartphone and tablet apps, allowing its ecosystem to be available on your TV, but until then, you're better off with a Roku (unless you're a Comcast subscriber who wants HBO GO on your TV).", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "R.D.
