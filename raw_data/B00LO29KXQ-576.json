[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "After our house was broken into and out PS3 stolen, I was looking for a new way to watch streaming TV that wasn't as expensive as a new gaming system. I wish I had gotten the Fire Stick much sooner. Very easy to use and has access to all of our streaming apps (Netflix hulu youtube). I love the mobility of it as you can take it from on TV to another. Although the price is low enough to get a couple of them for multiple TV's. I would definitely recommend and would be again if needed.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Meagan Klutz"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Love it finally something that actually does what it claim it can do.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ms. Cora"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "I was excited to find an alternative to the other brand streaming device.
