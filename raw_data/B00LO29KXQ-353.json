For watching Amazon videos it works fine. I also am using Plex to stream video from my PC. That seems to work.

It skips and starts constantly... and when it gets hot it stops working and completely freezes. On the plus side it seems to stream amazon prime with very little skipping and Netflix does just slightly worse than streaming prime.
