I first tried the Chromecast and I have been unhappy with it.  Everything buffers if you can even get anything to play at all.  Not with the Fire Stick, it hardly ever buffers, it's so fast.  I am very happy with it so far, I have only had it for a few weeks.  I will update this review if I have any problems but so far so good :)", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ginger"}]
