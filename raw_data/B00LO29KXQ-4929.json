The only thing you will need to be aware of is the distance from your wireless router, specially if you have other wireless devices. The fire stick tv will have a lag, either than that it's a good product for the price. Installation and setup was easy. I recommend it, specially for first time streaming device users.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Atheizzy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "WOW! I bought 2 of these for my daughters tv's in their bedrooms.  It has turned their inexpensive tv's into a \"smart\" tv like we have in the front room.  Had I known this we could have saved hundreds of dollars on our 60\" \"smart\" television in our front room.  I would recommend this very highly!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "suziemak \"Loven Life\""}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Was surprisingly pleased with the Fire TV Stick!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "TamsterH"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "Seems to function as advertised.

That was easy and the setup was easier than the other ones i have. The format is different so you will need to adjust to that if you are use to Roku or Itv. This unit does seem to preform better than the others i consider it to be the hardware make up. I do recommend the Fire Tv Stick to anyone who is considering Streaming Tv.
