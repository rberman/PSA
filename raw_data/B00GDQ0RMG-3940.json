Im so glad I ordered this! I use to love Chromecast but this Fire TV Stick has WAY more to offer! It's easy to install and perfect for my 5 year old to manuver through the many apps and channels available.  The picture on my flat screen seems to be clearer when watching anything on the Fire TV Stick.  No need for Cable anymore!!!  I truly recommend this to anyone!!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "tamaiden"}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's not working as well as I expected.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "momaplunk"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "The only thing that would make it better and possibly 5 star is voice search.
