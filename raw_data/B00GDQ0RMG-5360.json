[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Love that it's a smaller version of the Fire TV.  Have had issues with the Fire TV video freezing in a few apps, but so far the first stick is working perfectly.  My only complaint so far is that the remote feels cheap and uncomfortable in your hand.  The Fire TV remote has a great feel to the plastic material and is shaped/curved to fit really well in your hand.  I know the Fire Stick remote doesn't have the voice microphone ability and is smaller, but it could have been shaped similarly to the other.  The squared off edges aren't very nice.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Philip"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Great product for the price.

I was so happy! I tried to connect it to my router but had trouble. I called my internet provider's helpdesk and they helped me to get connected. Since the first day of being connected, my family hasn't been watching cable! We've been catching up on shows we've never watched on cable. We have watched some very good shows and movies that we've never seen. Love the foregone films and cartoons that wehaven't had the opportunity to watch before.  We have a prime membership so there is a lot of movies and games that we can access for free. I'm thinking of signing up for Netflix to expand our viewing selection. I would like to get rid of my cable, but we like to watch up to date episodes of our favorite shows. So we willkeep our cable and continue to love the Fire TV Stick.The stick plugged right into our HD TV. We did use the extender that came I to the package with the stick. I got the stick on sale. I'm going to wait for it to go on sale again before I buy another.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "G.
