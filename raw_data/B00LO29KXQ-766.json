I AM 56 AND LEARNED TO NAVIGATE THIS CONTROLLER EASILY. I HAD TOO MANY SHOWS ON CABLE I DIDNT WATCH, AND TOO MANY BUTTONS ON THE CONTROLLERS TO EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WERE FOR. CABLE NEVER LET ME PICK MY OWN PLANS FOR THE SHOWS I WANT. CRAFTS, PETS, DIY, NEWS, YOU TUBE, PLUTO TV, SMITHSONIAN, PBS, SCI FI, CONSPIRACY CHANNEL, ALL FREE. THERE ARE APPS YOU CAN BUY FOR .99 - 6.00, ONE TIME FEE. BUT I AM SO BUSY WITH WHAT I HAVE ALREADY I DONT THEM. OH, DID I MENTION ALL THE CRIME SHOWS, DISCOVERY ID, EVIL KIN, ETC.  THE STICK IS THE SIZE OF A CELL PHONE, PLUGS IN TO TV AND WALL, AND THATS IT.
