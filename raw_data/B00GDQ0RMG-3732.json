[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "Wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be.  There are a TON of things that one has to pay extra for (i.e. having to rent Bridge on the River Kwai?)The Amazon rating system seems very peculiar and is obviously trying to steer one towards paying extra money.  Probably worth it overall at that price, but don't get carried away with all the hype.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Chris"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Amazing!

I needed something to add in a guest room. I have two Rokus, a couple of android boxes and a Sony media streamer. I like this because, the Netflicks app is current and shows all the individual profiles.
