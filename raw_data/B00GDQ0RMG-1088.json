[{"rating": 3.0, "review": "As I write this, my Fire TV Stick says I'm not connected to the internet, when I quite clearly am. The only consistent thing about the FireTV Stick is that it's inconsistent. Some days it works fine, and other days it simply will not stay connected to WiFi. My AppleTV never has this problem, not do I have any issues with my Mac, iPad, or iPhone. When it works it's fantastic to be able to watch Prime on my TV without having to stream from my iPad, which is why I purchased this in the first place. Amazon needs to update the software so the Stick stays connected to the internet, because at the moment it's a $40 thing plugged into my TV that a rarely use, because having the internet constantly dropping is very irritating.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Nicole P."}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome entertainment addition.

It has a hard time staying connected or finding my wireless router. The router is in the room above and my other products have no problems connecting to it. Its the wireless cable/router provided by Comcast. 2nd gen Apple TV which is further away has no issues connecting as well as my 2006 Macbook. When it does connect and stays connected it is fine but it is a hassle waiting for it to connect and stay connected. Much easier to use the Amazon prime app on the iPhone and send it to Apple TV to watch movies/shows.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "CeDe"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Needs more instructions", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "S.E.

I was all hyped up to buy the stick for $24 and a savings of $15.The waiting list tried to stick for $24 was full??Yet they had one for me at $39, the regular price. Oh please!I would expect Amazon to refund all of us $15 each for everyone Who paid regular price on July 15.Shame on you Amazon!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Susan Lynn \"cat lady\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Awesome device for Prime members!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Felix Reznitskiy"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Works great", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "jamie l everts"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Clear picture.
