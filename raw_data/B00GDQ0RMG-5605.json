They ceased production of the box and stopped making updates for it the following year. I can't tell you what a relief it is to have something that actually works. Set up couldn't have been simpler. Its cheap as heck. I've only used Netflix and Pandora, but the HD picture and streaming are flawless. The only drawback I see is that it requires a power cord. I don't know a lot about much, but it seems to me that nothing HDMI or USB should need to be independently powered.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Suzanne Starr"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "What a bargin,I got.

I posted a video here. There were several other review complaints regarding the fireTV stick and certain Samsung HD televisions and so I decided to get to the bottom of it. After 1 hour and 20 minutes with two folks from Amazon tech support and two folks from Samsung tech support. The verdict is in. There is not a problem with my fireTV stick or my Samsung P2770HD. The problem is that the two products are not compatible. Simple as that folks. I am convinced that this Amazon's issue to solve in a future update after they have tested the product on certain Samsung HD tvs. This could be an issue with Onkyo and Yamaha as well because of several models in those brands not being in compliance with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) protocols. Luckily, my fireTV stick works fine for my other television (or else I would have given 1 star), but I bought it specifically for the Samsung in my office so waste of money, luckily it was not that expensive. I hope other Samsung owners have better luck, but I'd advise testing it on your Samsung, Onkyo, or Yamaha Brand Televisions before purchasing.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/3", "author": "Donnell Butler \"DJB\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "The fire stick connected to the net very easily and I was streaming movies in no time.
