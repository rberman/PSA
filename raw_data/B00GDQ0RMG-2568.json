My reason for saying that is moving around the Fire TV Stick interface is often very slow and \"clunky\" for lack of a better word. I also noticed last week while using the Fire TV Stick to watch the NFL draft on ESPN that the video would often pixelate and jump or freeze from time to time. While it was doing this I went to the television with the FireTV on it, brought up the ESPN app and watched some of the draft on it. Unlike the Fire TV Stick I never encountered and pixelization or jumping/freezing of the stream. Both devices are on my wireless network with the FireTV actually being in a worse location for signal than the stick in my office.That said it is still a good device and one I would recommend.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "shinerburke \"shinerburke\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "How did we ever live without it!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "K.
