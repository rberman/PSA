[{"rating": 4.0, "review": "Really enjoy being able to 'throw' things from my iPad to my TV via Chromecast. I am hoping they expand applications in the future and allow more than just Netflix/iTunes from the iPad. I've used this succesfully via Chrome on my MacBook Pro HOWEVER I do find that the audio/video are a bit out of sync when playing Netflix, etc. from the laptop to Chromecast.All in all, happy with the purchase. For $30 it does what it should, nothing more.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "K.V.C.L. \"K.V.C.L.\""}, {"rating": 3.0, "review": "It's pretty cool, but the main reason I got it was to utilize a browser component.  However the chrome browser on both my phone and tablet won't punch out to the TV.

After connecting the power and HDMI I was never able to get a picture on either of my TV screens. The device was working as the LED indicated and the network was able to see the device but we were never able to get any display on the TVs (HiSense and TCL).

With one step--pressing a small icon on my phone or tablet--I'm now able to watch media on my TV. Its simplicity is wonderful, and at this point I can hardly imagine not owning one. I'm not overstating when I say Chromecast has transformed how I watch movies and TV.I don't have cable because I have no interest in much of what cable offers (hello, Dance Moms), but I am passionate about good movies and excellent TV shows. Before owning a Chromecast, I watched those on my Nexus tablet, my laptop or my phone. I still enjoy watching movies and TV shows on those smaller devices when I'm away from my home, but at home it's so much more enjoyable now to watch them on a full-sized television. I just bring up Netflix, YouTube, Google Play or some other compatible service, I press the icon and the media starts seamlessly playing on my TV. Perfect.The one problem at this point isn't with Chromecast at all, but with Amazon which has at this point refused to make its media content compatible with Chromecast. What a shame.Regardless, even without Amazon's content, Chromecast is for me a must have as someone who loves great movies and great TV shows.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Carl Cox"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "I have Netflix and Pandora built into my Smart TV and also my Sony Blu-Ray player.But Chromecast makes it much more easy to access these features.It works so well and it's so cheap, I highly recommend it.With Chromecast, I am getting closer and closer to cutting my cable cord once and for all.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Haze Reid \"haze1123\""}]
