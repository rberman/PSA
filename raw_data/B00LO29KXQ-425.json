Also let me state that we have four Roku boxes in the house.  And I am an Amazon prime member, so I figured I should give it a go. First insulation was very easy!  I also work on computers and networks for a living so, getting it connected to the network was also easy. Here's where the issue started,  after about a day or two I noticed a slight pause every 30 seconds to every minute or so.  Making it slightly annoying to watch!  And trust me Internet speed is not an issue! I  try troubleshooting it,  reset up the network, try to different router,  all of which I knew were not the issue but I figured I'd try anyways .  Then I reset the device,  losing all my apps and started from scratch again. Finally I called Amazon saying I want to return it,  because they force you to call a number in order to return the fire stick!  Have to say I was pretty upset .  Then I talked to the lady on the  support line.  She said I had to reset it and try that.  She promised that would fix the issue even though I told her and already done It! I reset the fire stick and it got a little bit better for about two days again,  and it went right back to the same thing (  pausing and skipping constantly ) At that point rather than call Hotline again I just threw it aside went back to my roku,  and I have a watching problem for you ever sense.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Eric \"Book Addict\""}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "Easy to set up and works just as well as my more expensive Roku.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Ken Taubenfeld"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Not satisfied.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/3", "author": "mig"}]
