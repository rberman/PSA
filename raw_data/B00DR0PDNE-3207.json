Works seamless with Netflix. I can play many YouTube videos via Chromecast that is installed on my Nexus 7 android tablet . No need for set top box like Roku box. You don't waste power at all, since the device turns on, when the TV is turned on. Best and most affordable streamer yet.

If you stream Hulu and Netflix\u2019s on your iPad or other device, you need this. I was a little apprehensive at first about this. Seeing how others are more expensive.

No games, no showing my pictures or videos, ugh.It's basically a Netflix and Youtube player.

TV. Youtube and Netflix work great. The music thing is a little janky but I never listen to music on my TV anyway. Basically you upload all of your music to \"google play\" and then google decides what you can legitimately play on your TV. Not sure why they didn't just allow you to stream directly to the unit but whatever its freakin $35. Buy it!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Lamont Walton"}]
