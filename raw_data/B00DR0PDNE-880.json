I have had a Roku for several years and really liked the platform, and did not think that I would ever switch.  However, I recently decided to stop moving the Roku form room to room and thought I would try one of the new streaming stick devices.  The Roku device similar to Chromecast was $50 whereas the Chromecast is only $30.  Having used the Chromecast, I cannot see how other similar products can go for so much where this product only retails for $30.  The concept is interesting and different from the standard Roku which is a platform that has all channels available in one place.  With Chromecast, you have to have several apps to make this product stream to your TV.  The Chromecast acts only as an interface to get streaming content from your phone, tablet, computer, ect... to go to your television screen.  If you already have Youtube, Netflix, Crackle, ect on your device then this is no problem.  If you have to add these apps then this is slightly annoying but tolerable. The video quality is not the best, Netflix plays slightly grainy but not bad.  In all this device is a great way to stream content to the big screen from your devices but this is not really a replacement for a full platform device like my Roku 3 but for the money, this is a cool way to get content from a device to your TV.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "2/2", "author": "Chasin T Turnier"}]
