Hubby works a lot, son is away at college, I am studying in school, so we rarely watch TV. But when we do we use sling TV on the amazon fire stick. the cost is $20 /mo compared to satellite at $120/month and the prices keep going higher. Even adding Hulu and Netflix are more affordable and we can watch on our time. We are very pleased!!", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "KatH"}, {"rating": 2.0, "review": "I was so happy with the amazon fire stick that i wanted to replace all my rokus.

I thought this would be better.  It's not.  I thought it would be similar to Roku.  It's not.  I use a Roku on another TV and when I travel.  The Amazon Fire TV stick interface wasn't very intuitive, and it was difficult to find \"channels\" that I wanted to reference often.  Maybe I'm spoiled by my Roku 3.  If you are looking for a streaming device, I recommend that you pay a little more and get a Roku 3.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Beach Boomer"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Run!
