I'm also a Netflix subscriber with access through my blu ray player.  So as I suspected, other than some Amazon Prime movies and shows not yet available on Netflix, the Fire Stick doesn't give me a lot more content that I'm likely to watch beyond what I already had.  But it was cheap, so I thought I'd give it a shot.It was very easy to install and set up took about two minutes.  The interface is clunky.  Amazon should have studied Apple, not Netflix.About the biggest plus, besides some Prime content not available on Netflix, is I can now look at my vacation photos on my tv rather than just my computer, tablets and phone.  I'm sure my guests will be thrilled.Not much ventured, not much gained.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/1", "author": "Downing Bethune"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Did not know that I needed wireless internet to use.

Roku has it beat only in the channel department.  Roku gives you the ability to replace your cable box because you can just sign in to the channel thru the Roku still saving you money on the cable box monthly rental fee..if Amazon adds the fox locals, abc locals etc..they would put Roku out of business.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Happy Buyer M-LA"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Internet connectivity SUCKS.
