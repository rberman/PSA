This is garbage! I have gone around and around on the internet trying to trouble shoot this device. On my TV all I get is an error message telling me I am connected to the internet but cannot access the internet? After looking online for assistance I found several other folks with the same issue.

I have reconfigured my router, spent two hours on help lines, searched the internet time and time again and I still cannot get this to work. Not heavy enough for a door stop.
