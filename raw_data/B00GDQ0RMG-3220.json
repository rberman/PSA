I added about 75-80 apps the time to go through them all is EXCRUCIATING. Why can't they be grouped by category? Many of the apps do not tell you up front that a cable tv service is required for viewing. Waste of time!I have an iOS device, iPod touch 5th generation. The app for this device does not pair. I am an all Apple household with an older Apple wifi router which, apparently, does not support \"multi-something or other\" which prevents the app from pairing with the Fire TV Stick, so I cannot use its unique capabilities to voice search or use the apps keyboard to type. FRUSTRATING.The ONLY thing that make this device better than the Apple TV, which I have, is its larger storage and RAM capacity and speed. It also has a better choice of apps, most of which I can access on my iMac and just \"mirror\" to my Apple TV. The Fire TV Stick DOES have faster wifi access however which makes it easier to stream videos to but besides that, I would have been better off not making the purchase for this device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jerry Sundberg"}, {"rating": 5.0, "review": "For the price this is such an amazing product.
