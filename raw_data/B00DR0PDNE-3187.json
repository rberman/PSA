Still can't figure out how to play movies from my computer without freezing or moving to slowly. The idea is great but would like more selections of things to watch on it. It's cheaper than cable so I am saving money. Sometimes I have to unplug it and restart it more than I would like to. The idea is great but I wish there were more entertainment available besides Youtube, which has great movies but are sometimes blurred.

I'm untethered.  I've got AppleTV on the main tvs and, on the guest room and library tvs, Roku lite boxes. (I can't rave about either of those devices enough.)  The only thing I want to do that I can't is watch CBS on something other than my computer.  There is a viewer app, but episodes go up on the website a week earlier.  So if I'm doing dishes, I can not watch the most recent episode of, say, Hawaii Five-0.It may be that you can sit in a room with a pad and play whatever's on it on the tv in the room, but for streaming from the computer to another room, it's useless. The manual says it streams 20', but on my trials, it's not reliable even at under 20' with a wall between.  I can get it to connect, but the image quality is poor (would have even been willing to live with that) but it will only play for 45 to 90 seconds and then it loses the connection.  Repeatedly.  I've tried  multiple configurations and locations but can not get it to work. (And I'm pretty tech savvy.)So for me, this is a completely useless device.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Urie Bay"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "Won't connect to my wireless network, little or no support, probably going to return it.
