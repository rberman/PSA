[{"rating": 5.0, "review": "Great product.  You cannot completely cut the cord from cable yet with this as most of the channels you would watch require you to sign in with your cable subscription.  I used it as an additional \"cable box\" in my daughters room.  Instead of paying the extra room fee for the cable monthly she can watch the channels she watches live or on demand by signing in with the main cable information.  I would recommend to everyone that is thinking about it.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/1", "author": "Christopher A.
