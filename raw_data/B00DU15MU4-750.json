The Fire Stick if a great product, but the Amazon Fire TV is an exceptional product. The streaming is flawless without any distortions. I like the voice command to find movies it works every time.

We get a lot of compliments on it from friends and family. We're still in the process of downloading all of the apps we won't for it but so far for Netflix it has been great. I only gave it four stars because we got the fire TV to replace our cable as cable is expensive and this was a cheaper route to go. The only problem is some of the apps still need a cable provider to function which is a bummer. Perhaps these apps will create a month to month version as well one day. Still very happy about to purchase though.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "0/0", "author": "Jordan"}, {"rating": 4.0, "review": "Four stars because I am unable to use HBOGO due to restrictions by my internet carrier, Charter communications.
