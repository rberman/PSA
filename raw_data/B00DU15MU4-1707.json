I do enjoy playing the apps on it with the PlayPad Pro for Amazon Fire TV controller by Nyko. You can rent movies from Amazon or purchase them. The rentals can be a bit pricey, they need to be cheaper to compete with Red box and Netflix. If you get one buy a \"PlayPad Pro controller by Nyko\". It will make play these games so much more enjoyable and at half the price of the Amazon controller.", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "1/2", "author": "Icky Dog"}, {"rating": 1.0, "review": "It would have been really great if the ad made it plain you needed an Internet download speed of 600 bps minimum for this to work right.  I'm sure some techies would have figured that out for themselves, but it didn't occur to me that my 278 bps internet wouldn't be fast enough.  It set up just fine, then when I tried to play something, it stopped to load more content about every 20 seconds, and delivered a message that my Internet speed was too slow.  On the good side, returning it was a snap, but it would have avoided a lot of hassle for both me and Amazon if it had just prominently said on the ad \"Internet speed of 600 bps minimum required.\"", "verified": true, "helpfulness": "5/10", "author": "Devon M.
